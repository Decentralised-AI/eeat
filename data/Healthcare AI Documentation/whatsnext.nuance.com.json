While advancements in these technologies have taken\nawhile, recent developments have propelled the industry forward. The power of\nconversational AI, ambient AI and now generative AI is enabling new\nfunctionality that\u2019s furthering the mission of improved patient care and\nclinician-patient experiences.\n\nI\u2019ve often thought that advancements in technology are like raising children.\nWhen you\u2019re in it day-to-day, child development seems to move slowly, and you\ndon\u2019t notice all the changes. But when you look back, you realize how quickly\nthe time went and how fast they advanced through each childhood development\nstage.\n\nAdvancements in medical documentation technology are kind of like that. The\ntechnology has advanced significantly and transformed the workflow but it\u2019s\nbeen in phases over a long period of time.\n\nMedical documentation began without any technology. Clinicians took pen to\npaper to document patient care and stored patient charts in closets. Charts\nwere often illegible, they got lost, the quality of the documentation was\nhighly variable, and sharing them with other clinicians outside of the\npractice was difficult.\n\nThen came transcription, which began as a manual process where medical\nstenographers converted shorthand into medical documentation, which then\nevolved into typed notes on typewriters and then on computers. Today, instead\nof converting written notes into medical documentation, transcriptionists are\nconverting the audio of the patient encounter, which is captured by any number\nof recording devices (and has evolved over the years), to speech, which relies\non Natural Language Processing, a technology pioneered by Nuance.  However,\nmedical documentation created by transcription can take too long to get back\nand is often incomplete.\n\nBuilding on the foundation of transcription, is front-end speech. Using a cell\nphone or a microphone that integrates with a clinical workstation and a\ncomputer, a clinician simply dictates patient encounters directly into the\nelectronic medical record, speeding up medical documentation creation\nsignificantly. With Nuance\u2019s front-end speech solution, Dragon Medical One,\nclinicians can pre- and post-chart at any time and perform common tasks such\nas signing the note, navigating the EHR and placing orders \u2013 all with just\nvoice.\n\nThe latest technological advancement in medical documentation is AI-driven\nambient clinical intelligence (ACI). ACI solutions \u2013 like DAX copilot \u2013\ncaptures the patient encounter via a mobile application and automatically\nconverts multi-party conversations into specialty specific, structured\nclinical summaries immediately after a patient encounter. This technology was\nborn three years ago and is used by thousands of physicians in over 30\nspecialties nationwide. It\u2019s transforming medical documentation and delivering\nsignificant results. It\u2019s saving clinicians seven minutes on average per\nencounter. And that time savings is giving clinicians back time in their day\nand freeing them from documenting care during or after patient visits. In a\nrecent Nuance survey[i], 79% of clinicians stated that they have better work-\nlife balance and a 70% reduction in feelings of burnout and fatigue due to DAX\nCopilot. And because DAX Copilot is enabling clinicians to fully focus on\npatients and capture their complete story automatically, 85% of patients whose\nphysicians use DAX Copilot say their clinician is more personable and focused\ncompared to their previous visit.\n\nTogether, Dragon Medical One and DAX Copilot can be used for all charting\nneeds \u2013 with just your voice. Want to review a patient\u2019s history and results,\nsign a note, or place an order?  Use Dragon Medical One. Want to capture the\npatient conversation ambiently and document care automatically? Use DAX\nCopilot.  These solutions surround care teams with an AI-powered ecosystem of\nsupport that increases efficiency and documentation quality, while enhancing\nthe quality of care and delivering a better patient-clinician experience.\n\nThis is just the beginning of the benefits that AI-driven technology is\nbringing to healthcare. The potential for generative AI to further automate\nand simplify clinicians\u2019 tasks is enormous \u2013 particularly when combined with\nproven conversational and ambient AI in a seamless, workflow-integrated\nmanner. And while it may have seemed like it took a while to get here when in\ndevelopment, looking back, the advancement in medical documentation technology\nhas been fast and transformative.\n\n* * *\n\n[i] Based on Nuance\u2019s survey of over 1,000 clinician survey responses,\nconducted Feb 2023, US only.\n\nshare\n\nView PDF\n\n  * Share on linkedin __\n  * Share on twitter __\n  * Share via Email __\n  * Share on facebook __\n\nTags\n\n  * Burnout\n  * Dragon Medical One\n  * Dragon Ambient eXperience\n  * Future of healthcare\n  * Patient experience\n  * Physician documentation\n\n## You may also like:\n\n### Transforming the patient and physician experience with Dragon Medical\n\nMary Varghese Presti | Senior Vice President & General Manager, Dragon Medical\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n\n### Reducing clinicians\u2019 cognitive load to focus on their well-being\n\nDr. Reid Conant | Chief Medical Information Officer, Healthcare\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\n### Unlocking the future of patient care with ambient clinical intelligence\n\nKenneth Harper | Vice President & General Manager, Healthcare Virtual\nAssistants & Ambient Clinical Intelligence\n\nMarch 22, 2022\n\n## Related content:\n\n### Nuance and Microsoft Announce the First Fully AI-Automated Clinical\nDocumentation Application for Healthcare\n\nNuance\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\n### Nuance DAX ranked #1 in KLAS Emerging Solutions Top 20 Report\n\nNuance\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\n### Three Nuance Solutions Rank #1 in 2023 Best in KLAS Report\n\nNuance\n\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\n## Contact Us\n\n### Let\u2019s work together\n\nWant to join the conversation?
