Technologies\n\n# Technologies for Reducing Documentation Burden\n\n### Technological innovations offer promise in reducing and even eliminating\ndocumentation burden. Choosing a medical documentation solution that is right\nfor you is a personal preference, but it\u2019s also about weighing the costs,\nrisks, and time it takes to use daily.\n\n* * *\n\n### Below are five major technologies to help you reduce clinical\ndocumentation burden:\n\n### Medical scribes  \nVirtual scribes  \nMedical speech recognition  \nAmbient speech recognition  \nArtificial intelligence (AI) assistants\n\n* * *\n\n## Medical scribes\n\n**$2500\u2013$4500 per month**\n\nMedical scribes shadow the physician, document the note, and perform other\nadministrative tasks. Medical scribes are efficient but can be costly for\nprivate practices or individual health care professionals. They also are hard\nto scale and can put physicians at risk of malpractice due to possible\nfunction creep.\n\nMedical scribe companies >>\n\n**Pro:**  \n\u2022 Delegating documentation and other administrative tasks to an in-person\nscribe takes burden off the physician  \n\n\n**Con:**  \n\u2022 Not broadly used in family medicine or primary care due to costs and\ninvestment required (pre-med, medical students)  \n\n\n**Impact:**  \n\u2022 Increased productivity; reduced documentation burden  \n\u2022 57% increase in patient face time  \n\u2022 27% decrease in EHR time\n\n* * *\n\n## Virtual scribes\n\n**$1000\u2013$120 ****0 per month**\n\nVirtual scribes and transcriptionists reduce intrusiveness by removing the\nthird party from the exam room, but their usefulness is threatened by costs,\nnote turnaround times, offshore data transmission, and security risks.\n\nVirtual scribe companies >> Augmedix, Aquity, Athreon, ScribeEMR, SkywriterMD\n\n**Pro:**  \n\u2022 Cheaper than medical scribes and have no retention issues  \n\n\n**Cons:**  \n\u2022 Performs only patient charting  \n\u2022 Not real-time; up to 24-hour delay  \n\u2022 May incur added hardware costs\n\n**Impact:**  \n\u2022 Up to 85% burnout reduction  \n\u2022 1.1 hour/day EHR time reduction  \n\u2022 1 hour/day documentation reduction\n\n* * *\n\n## Medical speech recognition\n\n**Enterprise: $25\u2013$75 per month  \nSingle physician: $200 per month**\n\nMedical speech recognition (MSR) technology allows you to dictate your notes\ninstead of typing. Dictation devices can help improve health outcomes and\npatient understanding of care plans, but they don\u2019t fully relieve physicians\nof documentation burden due to the work they require to run at optimum.\n\nMedical speech recognition companies >> Dragon Medical, MModal, KLAS Ranking\n\n**Pro:**  \n\u2022 Established technology option with greatly improved accuracy\n\n**Con:**  \n\u2022 Similar to dictation but physician must navigate EHR and edit\n\n**Impact:**  \n\u2022 79% of users were satisfied with MSR  \n\u2022 77% reported improved efficiency\n\n* * *\n\n## Ambient speech recognition\n\n**$1800 per month**\n\nAmbient speech recognition technology \u201clistens\u201d to the caregivers\u2019 and\npatient\u2019s conversation with the physician throughout the encounter, including\nhistory and exam details, and works with an external staffed service to create\na visit note.\n\n**Pro:**  \n\u2022 Shows promise in decreasing burden and enhancing care and visit\ndocumentation efficiency  \n  \n\n\n**Con:**  \n\u2022 Ambient discussion in exam room is personal; MDM is purposeful and may not\nbe done in the exam room  \n  \n\n\n**Impact:**  \n\u2022 79% of users reported better documentation quality  \n\u2022 70% saw reduced burnout and fatigue  \n\u2022 81% of patients saw greater physician focus\n\n* * *\n\n## AI assistant\n\n**$150\u2013$200 per month**\n\nAI-powered, voice-enabled digital assistants can help physicians complete\ndocumentation and other administrative tasks. Although AI assistants still\nhave room to develop, they are the only documentation solutions on the market\nthat show promise in totally automating the EHR documentation process.\n\n**Pros:**  \n\u2022 Mobile assistant allows physician to step away from EHR and let assistant\ninteract  \n\u2022 Consumer-friendly features and cost  \n\u2022 Some AI assistants use a \"human in the loop\" to edit and correct the\ntranscription while the AI assistant learns\n\n**Con:**  \n\u2022 EHR integration is essential and vendors have been slow to support, but\nprogress is being made  \n  \n  \n\n\n**Impact:**  \n\u2022 72% reduction in documentation time  \n\u2022 40% decrease in after-hours work, including weekend work  \n\u2022 20% increase in practice satisfaction  \n  \n\n\n### Innovation Lab: Using an AI Assistant to Reduce Documentation Burden in\nFamily Medicine  \n\nThe AAFP launched a series of Innovation Labs to identify and demonstrate\ninnovations essential to optimizing the family medicine experience. The\ninitial phase provided proof that using an AI assistant can significantly\nreduce documentation burden and family physician burnout. Adoption was\nassessed based on the number of participants agreeing to buy the solution and\nthe impact realized during the lab trial.\n\nREAD REPORT\n\n* * *\n\n## Differences between AI and medical speech recognition\n\nUnlike AI, legacy MSR systems did not leverage deep learning needed to perform\nvoice-to-text conversion or have natural language understanding. Although\nnewer MSR solutions have progressed in these areas, AI assistants better\nunderstand natural language and can detect intent (i.e., commands from the\nuser). Whereas voice recognition solutions require the user to specify where\ndictation should be placed in the EHR note, AI assistants\u2019 built-in model of\ndocumentation recognizes embedded commands and knows where to place text. This\nability enables the physician to generate a note without having to navigate or\nedit in the EHR.\n\n* * *\n\n#### More on reducing documentation burden:\n\n Techniques for reducing documentation burden\n\n Transforming documentation burden\n\n_keyboard_tab_\n\nLearn About AAFP __\n\nAbout AAFP\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nAdvocacy\n\nWork at AAFP\n\nContact Us\n\nPhysician Support __\n\nCME\n\nEvents\n\nPhysician Careers\n\nAdvocacy Wins\n\nNews\n\nLet Us Help You __\n\nJoin AAFP\n\nPay Dues\n\nEngage with AAFP\n\nSponsored Resources\n\nMedia Center\n\nPopular Searches __\n\nMy Account\n\nReport CME\n\nView Transcript\n\nAAFP Credit System\n\nChapter Staff\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Academy of Family Physicians.
