This manual documentation process was not only\ntime-consuming but also exacerbated provider burnout and fatigue. As some of\nthe doctors pointed out, the longer time spent on clinical documentation meant\nclinicians had fewer opportunities to attend to new patients.\n\n\"While commercial technologies were available on the market, they came with a\nhefty price tag,\" said Douglas Davila-Pestana, Baptist Health's technical\nmanager of AI \u2013 another example of a recent trend in AI-specific job titles in\nhealthcare organizations.\n\n\"Given the challenging financial climate many healthcare organizations,\nincluding ours, were navigating, there was an urgent need for a more cost-\neffective and efficient system to streamline clinical documentation.\n\n\"We worked to have generative AI integrated into an AI-assisted documentation\napp that seamlessly blended medical transcription technology with advanced AI,\nspecifically large language models,\" he continued. \"This unique combination\nmeant the AI could swiftly generate clinical notes from transcribed patient\nconversations.\"\n\n> #### \"Before investing, organizations should weigh the costs of available\n> vendors against the feasibility of developing an in-house solution, keeping\n> in mind the unique needs and expertise available within their institutions.\"\n>\n> Douglas Davila-Pestana, Baptist Health South Florida\n\nThe benefit of the system was its immediacy: Clinicians could have access to\ncomprehensive clinical notes shortly after concluding a patient visit, cutting\ndown the lag time traditionally associated with manual documentation\nprocesses, he added.\n\n**PROPOSAL**\n\n\"To counter this manual documentation dilemma, a groundbreaking proposition\nwas made: the use of generative AI, leveraging services such as AWS\nHealthScribe for medical audio transcription and other tools like Azure\nOpenAI, Snowflake and DataRobot,\" said Jaymin Patel, manager of data platform\nand engineering at Baptist Health South Florida.\n\n\"The idea was to record patient-clinician interactions with the patient's\nconsent, transcribe these recordings into text, and then use a large language\nmodel to generate clinical summaries in a clinical SOAP format,\" he explained.\n\n\"This automation process was expected to drastically reduce the documentation\ntime to just two to five minutes post-visit. Moreover, by integrating with\nSnowflake, which supports our data lake, data warehouse and reporting layer,\nit was proposed that patient and appointment data could be easily pulled from\nour data warehouse platform to further enhance and personalize these\nsummaries.\"\n\nGPT-4, backed by research published in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, was highlighted as a promising LLM given its demonstrated\nproficiency in suggesting medical diagnoses. All these measures aimed to\nimprove the patient experience, improve clinical productivity, enhance\noperational efficiency, and lead to significant cost savings.\n\n\"In addition,\" Patel said, \"the data generated by the application was planned\nto be stored in the Snowflake data lake layer for further analysis and\napplication improvements.\"\n\n**MEETING THE CHALLENGE**\n\nThe technology journey began with the recording of patient-clinician\ninteractions. These recordings were sent to the AWS HealthScribe service for\ntranscription. Once transcribed, the text was fed into the large language\nmodel, which includes GPT-4. This model, by interpreting the transcription,\ngenerated concise summaries in clinical SOAP format, which then were verified\nby clinicians for accuracy.\n\n\"Cardiology physicians, along with their beta tester group of physicians, were\nthe primary users,\" Davila-Pestana noted. \"For the tech stack, AWS Lambda and\nAWS S3 were pivotal in building the AI service. The moment an audio\ntranscription file was generated, the AI Lambda Service, built on AWS, got\nactivated.\n\n> #### \"This automation process was expected to drastically reduce the\n> documentation time to just two to five minutes post-visit.\"\n>\n> Jaymin Patel, Baptist Health South Florida\n\n\"Integration with Snowflake was essential to extract patient appointment\ndata,\" he continued. \"Furthermore, once the summary was clinician-edited and\napproved, it would get exported and integrated with our electronic health\nrecord system. This entire process ensures timely, accurate and standardized\nclinical documentation.\"\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThis use of AI is expected to offer significant results in three major areas,\nDavila-Pestana explained:\n\n  1. **Time savings.** The group of physicians observe a reduction of several minutes per patient interaction, with regard to the overall time spent on clinical documentation. This newfound efficiency provides them with more bandwidth to attend to new patients, thus enhancing the patient care experience.\n\n  2. **Enhanced clinical productivity.** With the AI-assisted summaries, clinicians no longer have to wait for hours as they did with previous tools. The summaries now can be generated in mere minutes, resulting in quicker turnaround times and more streamlined operations.\n\n  3. **Cost efficiency.** By adopting this approach, Baptist Health South Florida sidestepped the considerable expenses of commercially available options, tapping into the organization's intellectual resources and technology and capitalizing on the efficiencies of AI.\n\n**ADVICE FOR OTHERS**\n\n\"For healthcare providers contemplating the incorporation of generative AI\ntechnology, it's crucial to view AI as a tool that augments, rather than\nreplaces, human input in clinical documentation,\" Davila-Pestana advised. \"AI\ncan bring about tremendous efficiencies, but blind reliance can lead to\noversight.\n\n\"Ensuring a human-in-the-loop verification process, where clinicians review\nand validate the accuracy of AI-generated summaries, is paramount to maintain\nthe integrity of patient records,\" he added. \"Furthermore, before investing,\norganizations should weigh the costs of available vendors against the\nfeasibility of developing an in-house solution, keeping in mind the unique\nneeds and expertise available within their institutions.\"\n\nLastly, any AI implementation should prioritize patient consent and data\nsecurity to maintain trust and adhere to healthcare regulations, he said.\n\n_Follow Bill's HIT coverage on LinkedIn:Bill Siwicki  \nEmail him: bsiwicki@himss.org  \nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication._\n\nTopics:\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Workflow, Workforce\n\n## More regional news\n\n## Provider organizations need AI trainers to ensure quality outcomes\n\nBy\n\nBill Siwicki\n\nFebruary 08, 2024\n\n## Best in KLAS 2024 shows vendors being more proactive for their clients\n\nBy\n\nAndrea Fox\n\nFebruary 08, 2024\n\n## How Mass General Brigham is using augmented reality to train its nurses\n\nBy\n\nMike Miliard\n\nFebruary 08, 2024\n\n**Want to get more stories like this one?** Get daily news updates from\nHealthcare IT News.\n\nYour subscription has been saved.\n\nSomething went wrong.
