Posey, Jr.\n\nPost a comment / Sep 18, 2023 at 12:34 AM\n\n0 __Shares __ __ __ __\n\n_In the fast-paced world of healthcare, clinical documentation is a crucial\naspect of patient care and the overall efficiency of medical institutions.\nHowever, doctors and medical professionals often find themselves burdened with\nextensive paperwork, taking away valuable time that could be better spent with\npatients. Enter Language Model-based Generative Artificial Intelligence (LLM\nAI), a cutting-edge technology that promises to revolutionize clinical\ndocumentation processes and significantly enhance the productivity and\naccuracy of healthcare professionals._\n\nOK, you\u2019ve probably already guessed that the introductory paragraph was\nwritten by LLM AI, specifically OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It\u2019s close enough to what I\nwould have written myself, but was composed in less than 1/100th of the time.\nThat kind of productivity improvement makes the case for deploying LLM AI to\nhandle clinical documentation nearly irresistible, and the world\u2019s tech titans\nhave piled into the opportunity.\n\nPromoted\n\n#  Heard at HLTH: Quantum Health\n\nQuantum Health\u2019s Chief Product Officer, Dan Shur talks about the company\u2019s\nrecent Index Report on the changing landscape of healthcare consultants.\n\nQuantum Health and MedCity News\n\nFor those of us who are not technicians, generative LLM AI uses algorithms and\nan enormous sample of existing, coherent information to machine-learn the\nconnections and relationships between words. With an adequate set of human\ninstructions called \u201cprompts\u201d, LLM AI can construct sentences, write research\npapers, create art, develop computer code, and pass a US Medical Licensing\nExam. When you combine that kind of intelligent composition power with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM AI tools have the potential to\ndramatically improve the efficiency of clinical documentation processes.\n\n**Clinical documentation and provider burnout**\n\nWhile clinical documentation serves a number of functions, four are paramount\nfor most practitioners:\n\n  * Patient Care: the record of the medical history, current diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient\n  * Care Team Communications: a mechanism for the treating physician, nurses, specialists, diagnostics providers, and others to communicate asynchronously about the patient\u2019s care\n  * Billing Support: accurate documentation to support full and fair reimbursement.\n  * Legal Defense: a contemporaneous account of a physician\u2019s conclusions, recommendations and disclosures to the patient.\n\nPromoted\n\n#  Heard at HLTH: Clarify Health\n\nTodd Gottula, co-founder and president of Clarify Health, discusses how their\nanalytics platform promises to power higher margins and higher value care for\nits customers.\n\nClarify Health and MedCity News\n\nBecause thorough and accurate clinical documentation is critical to both\npatient care and the business of healthcare, getting it right can create a\nheavy burden for clinicians and medical staff.  A 2022 _JAMA Internal\nMedicine_ report confirmed that physicians are spending nearly two hours per\nday outside office hours completing clinical documentation. In simplest terms,\nthat is an extra work day every week.\n\nThis is not just an inconvenience; it\u2019s having disastrous effects on physician\nquality of life and mental health. A 2022 _New York Times_ report suggested\nthat one critical factor in physician burnout is the incongruity between the\ndeep mission of personal care and engagement that caused many bright,\nambitious students to become doctors, and the impersonal, bureautic, business\nside of healthcare on the other.\n\n**Is AI the answer? Yes \u2013 but with limits.**\n\nCan LLM AI support effective clinical documentation?  The short answer is\nabsolutely, but with limits. A recent academic study of the leading LLM AI\nmodels\u2019 ability to read and interpret clinical information demonstrates the\nincredible power of these tools to support healthcare, but concludes that LLMs\nshould be used as \u201ca supplement to existing workflows rather than as a\nreplacement for human expertise.\u201d\n\nLLM AI offers incredible promise in easing the burden of clinical\ndocumentation for doctors and practices, and there are a multitude of\nreputable companies offering AI driven documentation solutions. In order to\nevaluate whether AI is right for your organization, there are a handful of\nquestions to ask:\n\n  * **How exactly does the solution integrate with my existing practice technologies?  ** This is more than just a yes or no question relative to EMR integration. Is the AI clinical documentation solution able to pull information from the EMR for a complete SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan elements of a patient encounter)?  Does it synchronize with patient schedule information so that patient demographics are automatically included in clinical notes in real time?\n  * **Will an AI derived clinical note be a \u201cSiri-esque\u201d rough first draft that requires a substantial amount of time editing, or will it be a complete SOAP note subject only to physician review and approval?  ** The former output will not provide nearly as much time savings or efficiency as the latter.  In today\u2019s state of the \u201cAI art\u201d, however, the latter output likely involves a human-in-the-loop within the service provider to assure \u201cfinal SOAP note\u201d quality and thus could have a higher initial cost.\n  * **How does the AI solution empower billing and coding effectiveness?** It is no longer necessary to settle for, \u201cthe physician will draft a summary note of the patient encounter and the coders will figure out how to bill for it.\u201d  An integrated AI solution can be designed to capture, near perfectly, every relevant aspect of the patient encounter such that complete and accurate coding is an assured part of the practice workflow.\n  * **Does the output of AI-generated clinical documentation improve the physician\u2019s ability to practice and defend good medicine?** By no means am I suggesting that AI LLM can write a better SOAP note than the physician could. But, the majority of physicians do not have the time today to write what s/he would consider their best possible note for every patient encounter. With AI\u2019s ability to learn the individual preferences and styles of each physician, it can empower the doctor to create a near perfect note every time, in a fraction of the time.\n\nThe rate of advancement of AI technologies over the past year has been\nastounding. While philosophers and ethicists may debate whether AI could\nreplace medical decision making in the future, there is no doubt that AI is\nimproving how clinicians and patients experience medical care delivery today.\nBecause AI-supported clinical documentation solutions can eliminate a key\ndriver for physician burnout, we will see health systems and practices using\nthese technologies as competitive differentiators in the effort to attract and\nretain clinical talent.  The power and limitations of LLM AI demand careful\nassessment to assure that a proposed solution will deliver both the essential\nfunctions of clinical documentation and a material savings in physician and\nstaff time.\n\n0 __Shares __ __ __ __\n\n#### Topics\n\nclinical documenttion, generative AI, large language model\n\n__\n\n## Hear the latest industry news first.
