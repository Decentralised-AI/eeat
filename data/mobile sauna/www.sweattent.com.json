My backyard\n\nRated 5 out of 5 stars\n\n10 months ago\n\nSweat tent trial runs\n\nDuring the first week of having the Sweat Tent I used it 6 times. It has done\neverything I expected it to. The space inside could fit 3-4 people if needed.\nAny more than that and you\u2019re likely getting too close to the burning hot\nstove. I feel like 2-3 is the right number though for a good sauna session. I\nuse it on my deck, I placed some rubber mats underneath to help regulate how\nmuch air flow can come from below with a piece of treated plywood underneath\nthe actual stove. I have gotten it to 200\u00b0+ but found that I prefer it right\naround 170-180\u00b0 with about 50-60 on the hygrometer. Best to get the fire going\nwith kindling then continue to stoke with medium sized split hard firewood for\na long even burn. Quality of the tent is great so far, I\u2019ve used it in a\nblizzard. with plenty of snow on the roof. Be prepared for some of the seams\nto leak as the heat melts snow off the roof. I didn\u2019t mind this as it added\nhumidity. The first few sessions I kept all window coverings on because I\nquestioned the ability for the plastic windows to hold heat well, I later\nnoticed that if you have a good burning fire you\u2019re probably fine to take the\ncovers off as it holds heat quite well. Keep in mind I\u2018ve only used it in\nbelow freezing temps as I\u2019m in the middle of Minnesota winter. All in all, so\nfar so good and happy with my purchase/investment.\n\nRead More\n\n    * Was this helpful?\n\nYes, this review was helpful. 99 people voted yesNo, this review was not\nhelpful 53 people voted no\n\n  *  **Caleb G.**\n\nVerified Reviewer\n\nI recommend this product\n\nSweatTent helped you to...

The initial setup is simple and\nQUICK! Once you season your stove (outside not inside the sweat tent) for a\nhour. You\u2019re officially ready to sweat! And it doesn\u2019t disappoint.. 200f in 30\nminutes. If you\u2019re going to leave your sweat tent outside over a snow fall i\nwould recommend putting an 80 inch pole in the middle of the sweat tent where\nthe roof is where the supporting joint is that pops down so it doesn\u2019t\ncollapse due to the weight. Otherwise you can just take it down and set it up\nevery time. This is by no means a bad thing just preference for those who want\nto leave their sweat tent up. If you\u2019re worried about the tent fading due to\nsun exposure.. you can always put a tarp over it and remove the top portion of\nthe pipes the pop out the roof. Just my two cents! Killer product!!

Our tents are constructed with two layers of durable fabric with one\nlayer of insulation in-between that retains heat very well, even in colder\nclimates. When used properly, Sweat Tent will maintain temperatures of 180\u00b0F+\nin temperatures as low as 10\u00b0F.\n\nWhat is the tent made of? Does it release any chemicals?\n\nOur tents are made of Oxford 210D Nylon that is rated to 300\u00b0F, meaning it\nwill not melt or leach chemicals at 200\u00b0F (the approximate highest temperature\nour saunas go). The tent windows are made of a high-temperature performance\nTPU. We put our saunas through testing using the highest quality, USA NIST\ncalibrated equipment on the market from Forensics Detectors. Our test results\nshow that when SweatTent is heated to 200\u00b0F there are zero concentrations of\nCO or VOCs present in the air.\n\nWhat is the recommended flooring?\n\nYour SweatTent can be placed on concrete, tile, dirt, grass, turf, wood\n(unvarnished), or ice (at least 1 ft thick). Pro tip: for an elevated and\nfunctional aesthetic, visit your local Home Depot, Lowe's or Ikea to purchase\ninterlocking wood tile flooring.\n\nHow long does it take to heat up?\n\nIt takes 20-30 minutes to reach temperatures of 176\u00b0F-200F. How much firewood\nyou use, what type of firewood you use, and time of year will impact the\nheating time. 3-4 pieces of split hardwood firewood is typically sufficient to\nget Sweat Tent heated to therapeutic temperatures of 176\u00b0F+.\n\nWhat are the assembled dimensions?\n\n6ft (L) x 6ft (W) x 7ft (H). The chimney extends 2ft above the roof.\n\nDoes it smell? How do you clean it?\n\nIt does not smell, and there is not much cleaning required. Moisture runs down\nthe sides of the tent walls and drains onto the ground. Any residual moisture\nis evaporated due to the high heat inside the tent. We recommend emptying the\nash tray and removing excess soot from the chimney after every 3-4 uses.\n\nWhat prevents it from blowing over in windy conditions?\n\nSweat Tent has a built-in skirt running along both the interior and exterior\nof the base. We recommend weighing down the skirt with heavy weights such as\ncinder blocks, bricks, or sandbags. It also comes with ground stakes and ropes\nto tie it down and secure it further in windier conditions.\n\nCan you leave it up outside permanently?\n\nYes, you can leave it up outside permanently, with a few exceptions. SweatTent\nis made from a durable, weather-resistant fabric and includes a weatherproof\nroof cover. Keep the roof cover on at all times. Pack it up and store it\nindoors during times of extreme weather like heavy snow/wind storms.\n\nWhat's included in the order?\n\nEach order includes the tent, stove, rocks, rocks holder, thermometer, roof\ncover, fire poker & gloves. The bench, water bucket+ladle, and other\naccessories are available as add ons.\n\nWhat size wood can fit in the stove?\n\nThe max length of firewood you can feed into the stove is 16 inches. We\nrecommend using split hardwood cut to 12 inches long. The opening of the stove\nis 8.5 inches wide x 5 inches tall.\n\nDoes it produce much smoke?\n\nOnce heated, Sweat Tent produces very little smoke. This is thanks in part to\nour innovative stove design featuring a built-in spark arrestor. We also\nrecommend using dry hardwood firewood and avoiding softwood firewood &\nsynthetic fire logs.\n\n## Features\n\n3 minute setup and takedown\n\nJust 3 minutes from unzip to fire lit with our special \"QuickPop\" tent design\nand \"EasyStack\" chimney.\n\nHeats up to 200\u00b0F in 30 minutes\n\nOur powerful stove combined with our 3-ply insulated tent produce the highest\nheat output possible (200\u00b0F) in the shortest amount of time (30 minutes)\n\nFits up to 3 people\n\nSpacious interior fits 3 people comfortably.\n\nUltra efficient\n\nPay an average of $2 per sauna session (3 wood logs)\n\nRetains heat in any climate\n\nRetains heat very well, even in colder climates. Tested in temperatures as low\nas 10\u00b0F.\n\nBuilt to the highest safety standards\n\nOur integrated spark arrestor, fireproof roof cover, & steel-plated chimney\nvent protect your sauna and your surroundings from damage.\n\nMade with non-toxic materials\n\nMade from heat-resistant Oxford 210D Nylon & TPU, and tested in temperatures\nexceeding 200\u00b0F, you can rest assured that there is no risk of chemical off-\ngassing.\n\n## Peace of mind\n\nEvery SweatTent comes with a 1 year manufacturer warranty out of box.\n\n  \nWe also have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.
