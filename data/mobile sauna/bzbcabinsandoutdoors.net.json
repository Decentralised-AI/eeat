Great customer service\nthroughout our 5 day rental. Sigmar provided us with a box of firewood cut to\nsize for the stove and we enjoyed every moment of our sauna time! The sauna\nwas clean, neat and well worth it. Delivery and pick up were friendly, fast\nand easy. I would highly recommend it for a spa weekend at home.\n\nMargit-Joanna Pikkor\n\n _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_\n\nRead More\n\nAs a brand new owner of a BZB sauna, I can\u2019t be more pleased and thankful for\nthe versatility and quality craftsmanship.
