But I came to\n> understand that every DEX/CEX has their failure implemented by the dev teams\n> knowingly/unknowingly! Recently, swap u do will never process, & if u\n> research how to cancel it, Trust wallet will give u one option that is bound\n> to fail so that u keep losing ETH trying to cancel pending transaction! They\n> know these things happen but they allow it to make ur life miserable! Simple\n> solution? Never use wallet connect feature, Write down ur secrete phrase on\n> paper, uninstall the trust wallet app, install new one & watch all those\n> pending garbage vanish! Trust wallet is becoming nuisance! They\u2019ve been\n> taken over by other apps like ViaWallet, OKX and many others! I hate using\n> any of the old CEX/DEX making me lose eth in the name of useless gas fee!\n> What a boring idea to peg every swap with mountainous gas fee! Trust wallet,\n> Coinbase, Binance, FTX and many more are designed to fail! The future\n> doesn\u2019t belong to them! That\u2019s my observation! I swap between any crypto on\n> ViaWallet or OKX without hearing anything called Gwei or gas fee! Ask\n> urself, why? Why must I initiate transaction with high cost & it stays on\n> pending and often can\u2019t be found on the Eth blockchain? These exchanges made\n> it so for greed & greed only! If u do not wake up now, u will not wake up\n> later! Nothing is 1% special about trust wallet in comparison to its\n> competitors! Prove me wrong!\n>\n> more\n\n###  Developer Response  ,\n\n> We are sorry to hear about your negative experience with Trust Wallet and\n> the frustration you've faced regarding failed swaps and pending\n> transactions.
