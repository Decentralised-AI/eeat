Available on Github __.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is the reason we\u2019re all here. After Satoshi Nakamoto released the\nfamous Bitcoin White Paper and started running the Bitcoin Blockchain, a\nrevolution was born. Our company was created to solve some of the challenges\nthat Bitcoin presented to its users.\n\nBitcoin is a fast\u2013moving, evolving network. Edge has always kept up, giving\nusers the functionality they need to get the most out of what the Bitcoin\nnetwork has to offer. The Edge Wallet supports Segregated Witness\ntransactions, dynamic and custom mining fees, and connecting to your own full\nBitcoin node.\n\nBitcoin is the oldest and most secure blockchain in existence and continues to\nsolidify itself as high powered digital gold. Since our inception, we\u2019ve been\ncommitted to helping users get the most out of Bitcoin, whether it be a\npayment method, store of value, or as an on-ramp to other digital currencies.\n\n\n\n## **The Benefits Of The Edge Bitcoin Wallet**\n\n### **1\\. Buy, Sell, and Save Bitcoin**\n\nIn addition to storing, transferring bitcoin between wallets, and receiving\ncryptocurrencies in their wallet, users can also swap assets while on the\nmove.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts can utilize the wallet\u2019s built-in exchange functionality to\ntake advantage of market movements, even while away from their computer\nscreens. You can easily swap a cryptocurrency you think is going to fall in\nvalue for another currency of greater value.\n\n\n\n### **2\\. Mobile Access to Your Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets**\n\nEdge wallet gives users access to their money anywhere, anytime. With Edge\ninstalled on their mobile device, users have complete freedom to instantly\nsend or receive any of our supported cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n### **3\\. Multi-Currency Support**\n\nUnlike many other mobile wallets, Edge supports multiple cryptocurrencies\nbeyond Bitcoin. In addition, we are continuously developing and striving to\nadd full support for additional currencies.\n\n\n\n### **4\\. Highly Secure**\n\nEdge includes robust security features never previously seen in a mobile, web-\nbased, or desktop cryptocurrency wallet. Click here to learn more about Edge\u2019s\nsecurity features.\n\n\n\n### **5\\. Intuitive User Interface**\n\nWe\u2019ve designed our user interface with accessibility in mind, making it easy\nto create and access numerous wallets from the main Wallets dashboard.\n\n\n\n## **Cryptocurrency Wallet vs. Exchange\u2014What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is specialized software that enables an investor to\nsecurely store their holdings, with users having options to choose between\nboth hot wallets (online) and cold wallets (offline). Cold wallets are often\ndescribed as the \u201csafest\u201d way for an individual to secure their\ncryptocurrency. At Edge, we fundamentally disagree with this narrative, and\ninstead realize that \u201csafety\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d are dependent on the threat a\nuser is securing against. In developing Edge, our goal has been to create a\nwallet that offers both a high degree of security, as well as usability. Edge\noffers the ease of access that comes from a hot wallet for regular use, along\nwith high levels of security previously said to only be achieved with cold\nwallets.\n\nThe term \u201cwallet\u201d is generally used to describe self-custody solutions where\nthe user holds their own private keys. Exchanges, on the other hand, are\ncustodians, meaning the exchange holds private keys on behalf of their\ncustomers. Exchanges were originally created to facilitate buying, selling,\nand trading different cryptocurrencies, with a variety of purchasing options.\nWallets were originally created to allow users to send, receive, and hold\ntheir own private keys, without having to rely on a third-party custodian.\n\nToday, many wallets have enabled exchange functionality inside of their\napplications. At Edge, our primary focus has been to provide robust, globally\naccessible exchange functionality inside of our application. While some\nwallets are more limited in their ability to support buying, selling, and\ntrading, Edge\u2019s core focus is to offer these to our end users all across the\nglobe. This merger of exchange functionality into wallets has blurred the\nlines between what is a \u201cwallet\u201d and what is an \u201cexchange\u201d. The easiest\ndistinction to make is that wallets offer self-custody, while with exchanges,\nthe exchanges act as the custodian.\n\n\n\n## **Should I Keep My Crypto On An Exchange Or In A Wallet?  **\n\nThe decision on whether to keep your cryptocurrency on an exchange or in a\nwallet is entirely personal. However, keeping your cryptocurrency on an\nexchange may result in a complete loss of funds if either your personal\naccount or the exchange itself is hacked. As well, without controlling your\nown private keys, the exchange has complete control over your assets,\nresulting in third-party risk.\n\nIf you\u2019re an active day trader, keeping a relatively small position on an\nexchange is a good option for facilitating regular moves in and out of\npositions. This is due to reduced fees and settlement times on exchanges\nrelative to the network fees and settlement times of on-chain transactions.\nUsers should strongly consider storing their holdings directly in a wallet\nrather than an exchange for any assets being held for the long term and\ntreated as an investment. Wallets offer far greater individual protection\nagainst hackers, with many having multiple layers of security to keep users\u2019\ncrypto assets safe.\n\n## Get the latest on Crypto  \nSign up for our newsletter\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nEmail\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\u0394\n\n## Wallets\n\n  * Bitcoin \n  * Ethereum \n  * Litecoin \n  * EOS \n  * Stellar \n  * XRP \n  * Dash \n  * Monero \n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Crypto Loans\n  * Edge-ucation\n  * Events\n  * Get Started\n  * White Paper __\n  * Careers __\n  * FAQ __\n\n## Contact\n\n  * Submit Ticket __\n  * App Feedback __\n  * Request API Key __\n  * Call +1.619.777.5688\n  * Text +1.619.777.5688\n  * Request In-Person/Virtual Support __\n\nTwitter ____ Linkedin ____ Github ____ Youtube ____\n\nGet the App\n\n__\n\n__\n\n\u00a9 Edge App 2023\n\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nNotifications\n\n",
