There are hundreds of bitcoin wallet apps. Most wallets\nare custodial, therefore \u2014 not secure, not private, and not independent.  \n\nEven if a wallet is non-custodial, it may still not be secure. Only\nreproducible wallets are completely secure. Mycelium is among them. Mycelium\nis the most popular among them.\n\nSource\n\n# Self-custody Made Perfect\n\nBitcoin\n\nAdvanced cold storage, saving and spending accounts  \n\n100% Secure\n\nReproducible wallet, open-source, incognito use, untraceable  \n\nEthereum\n\nETH and meaningful ERC-20 tokens\n\nOnramp & grow\n\nIn-app exchange and trading\n\nKnowledge base\n\nIn-app educational materials\n\nInter-wallet Operability\n\nFIO Network\n\nNewbies, Pay Attention!\n\nHow to make your funds secure?  \n\n**Make a backup** by following the instructions in the app.\n\nWhat if you lose your phone?  \n\n**No problem.** It takes one minute to restore your accounts from your backup.\n\nWhat if you lose your backup?  \n\n**You lose** your money.\n\nWhat's the point of putting up with such inconveniences?  \n\n**Because bitcoins are better than money in a bank.** With Mycelium Wallet,\nyou avoid banking nonsense. Payments can not be reverted, suspended, or\ndeclined. Accounts can not be blocked. No cross-border control and fees.\nStorage is secure and free. No subscription fees of any kind. No payment\nlimits; no maximum daily or monthly amounts.\n\nHow much do payments cost?\n\n**It depends on the situation in the Bitcoin network and how urgent you need\nto pay.** It is you who assigns the miner fee in each case, so be careful. If\nyou offer too much, you spend too much. If you set the fee too low, you delay\nyour payment. The app offers several standard options, but you're the only one\nwho makes the decision.  \n\nWhat is the main drawback?\n\n**There is no one to address your complains to.** Mycelium does not touch your\nmoney. It is only a relay between you and the Bitcoin network. There can be no\nfundamental Bitcoin failures, but things can slow down, and your wallet may be\nout of sync for a while. On the other hand, custodial wallets (those that\nexplicitly stand between you and your money) do not solve the problem entirely\nanyway. But you still pay for an illusion of smoothness with the full physical\ncontrol of your funds given out to some random people.  \n\nOne more piece of advice: **NEVER  store your bitcoins on the exchanges.**\n\nIf you use centralized exchanges to buy bitcoins, withdraw your assets as soon\nas you bought them. You do not control your coins there. Bitcoins are like\nphysical coins. That's why crypto-exchanges are vulnerable to outright\nrobbery. And that is YOUR problem. The relevant regulation is inadequate. In\ncase of a hack, no reimbursement of funds is guaranteed to you.
