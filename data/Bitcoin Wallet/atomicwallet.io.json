That's evolving as\ncryptocurrencies evolve and gain popularity, especially Bitcoin. Bitcoin is\nbecoming less volatile and more established, leading some countries, like El\nSalvador, to adopt it as a second official currency or even an inflation\nhedge. Countries are turning to crypto as they adjust quantitative easing\nefforts to salvage the fiat currency model.\n\nBitcoin, unlike fiat, is a finite token system that can work as a currency or\nstore of value. Many investors are diversifying their portfolios by including\nBitcoin to hedge the risk associated with fiat and money printing. You'll need\na Bitcoin Wallet to store and transact your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nWe produced this helpful guide to teach you everything you need about getting\na Bitcoin Wallet app and storing your digital gold. You'll also benefit from a\ndetailed guide on a specific wallet, Atomic Wallet, which offers useful\nfeatures like sending and receiving, staking, and exchange.\n\nLet's start by learning more about the first-ever cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\n## What Is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the first-ever cryptocurrency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.\nCryptocurrency gets its name from the cryptographic equations miners solve\nbefore validating a block of transactions. It's a digital currency that works\non peer to peer Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin is built on blockchain technology, and the digital money is secured\nthrough cryptographic hashing over a distributed decentralized network. Each\ntransaction block is distributed over multiple wallet addresses as account\nnumbers. Bitcoin's primary and only function is to be a store of value that\nusers with Bitcoin wallets can send and receive. Other digital assets, like\nEthereum, can execute smart contracts.\n\nBitcoin is the first digital currency that operates on blockchain technology.\nA blockchain is a series of blocks containing all the transactions that\noccurred in the past 10 minutes. New blocks are generated every 10 minutes.\n\nBefore creating a new block, the current block must be verified. It can never\nbe overwritten once verified and all the transactions in that block are\nconfirmed. This immutable distributed ledger is a transparent list of\ntransactions anyone can explore. The transactions don't display any usernames,\nonly wallet addresses.\n\nHow does a wallet work, and what differs from a bank account?\n\n## How Do Bitcoin Wallets Work?\n\nA Bitcoin wallet is a software program that generates an address, stores\ntokens, and allows you to send and receive Bitcoin. Simple, right? Well,\nthat's the concept's bare bones. In reality, though, wallets have much, much\nmore to them.\n\nA crypto wallet is an app to store your crypto portfolio. First, Bitcoin\nwallets don't support other crypto assets. It also doesn't have staking\noptions or exchanges to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike the basic Bitcoin wallet, Atomic Wallet encompasses all the above\nfeatures: users can buy, exchange, and manage Bitcoin conveniently.\n\nThough not all wallets are the same, you have dozens of Bitcoin wallet apps\nout there to choose from. Some wallets are basic, just for storing, sending,\nand receiving, while Atomic offers a built-in exchange, staking, cashback\npayments, and other options. You should choose a wallet to suit your needs.\n\nAnother fun fact: you can have more than one wallet! You have more than one\nphysical wallet at home, right? You can do the same with cryptocurrency\nwallets, too. Decentralized crypto apps like Atomic allow you to store all\nyour wallets in one place. Hardware wallet support also helps many users to\nprotect their assets with another layer of security features.\n\nNow that you have your Bitcoin wallet, you may have many questions about it.\nLet's get technical here and try to answer some questions.\n\nFirst, let's look at Atomic Wallet account and how to get started with it.\n\n## Atomic Bitcoin Wallet Features\n\nAtomic Wallet has many features, and we'll discuss 4 of the main features and\nhow to use them next.\n\n### 1\\. What Is a Bitcoin Wallet Address?\n\nIt's like your mailing address; you give it to anyone who wants to send you\nsome Bitcoin! The most pressing question you can ask is: where's my address,\nand how do I use it? After downloading the app for your PC, iOS, or Android\ndevice, you'll find it on Atomic Wallet's main screen.\n\n  * Go to Bitcoin and open it.\n  * Find send and receive at the bottom\n  * Click on receive, and you'll see your wallet's address\n\nA wallet address is usually between 27 and 34 alphanumeric characters. Bitcoin\naddresses begin with only three alphanumeric characters 1, 3, or bc1. An\nexample of a Bitcoin address is: **1BvBMZAUstWetqTFn5Au8m4GFh7xJaNPM2**\n\nUnlike regular mailboxes, you won't get a call that your mail reached another\nperson by mistake. Always ensure you're sending your Bitcoins to a Bitcoin\naddress, or else it could be lost forever without any way to get it back. This\napplies to all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin.\n\nWe can't emphasize this enough, always double-check your addresses!\n\n### 2\\. Bitcoin Seed Phrases\n\nWhen you create a wallet, you need to create a seed phrase. It usually\nconsists of 12 random words in a particular order. Write it down and save it\nsomewhere safe. This is your only opportunity to set up your passphrase. We'll\nget to passphrases next, but hold on to your seed phrase for now.\n\nThis phrase allows you to access your wallet if you get locked out or get a\nnew phone and you need to re-download your wallet. You also need it to\nreactivate your wallet on your new phone. Still, you should delete your wallet\nfrom your old phone and wipe the data off once it's all migrated to your new\ndevice.\n\nIf you're using a wallet on a desktop computer, migrate it to a new machine\nbefore throwing out the old one. Otherwise, you might spend the rest of your\nlife sifting through a landfill to find it. We're not joking! That's a true\nstory you can read more about here. But don't worry: While keeping the\nmnemonic seed phase in a safe place, you can sign in to your crypto wallet\nanytime in any place.\n\n### 3\\. Bitcoin Passphrases\n\nYou should have a seed phrase to restore your wallet on another PC or mobile\ndevice. Moreover, you should also secure your wallet with a custom password.\nThat's just another level of security to protect your favorite cryptos. You\nwouldn't just leave your cash lying about your house and don't do it with\ncrypto. You'll want to keep it as secure as possible.\n\nA passphrase is like two-factor authentication, but the questions are about\nthings you know, not something you are/have. Many traditional security\nquestions ask things like: what street did you grow up on, what was your\nmother's maiden name, what was your first pet's name, etc. Typically, only you\ncould answer these questions. Still, anyone cunning enough could discover this\ninformation and learn how to steal your wallet.\n\n### 4\\. Private Keys and Public Keys\n\nYou've probably heard the terms private and public keys when discussing\nencryption. What are they, though? A private key is just that: your wallet's\nkey. Your Bitcoin wallet must have a private key to generate a public key.\nEssentially, the private key identifies your wallet on the network. You must\nalso store it in a safe place like your seed phrase. Learn how to store it\nproperly in our blog post.\n\nThe public key is a hashed version of your private key. That way, it can only\nbe decrypted one way, not decrypted in reverse. In other words, if you send\nBitcoin to an address (public key), it can only be decrypted one time, in one\ndirection. That's why we say make sure you're sending it to the correct\naddress!\n\nThe public key is decrypted to show the private key and send funds to the\ncorrect address. This one-way encryption is hashing, the most prevalent form\nof encryption in cryptocurrency.\n\nYou must pay the fee to get your Bitcoin from one wallet to another.\n\n## Bitcoin Miner Fees\n\nMiner fees are dynamic and always make the news because they're so high.\nThey're not always so high, but Bitcoin has gone through several periods where\nnetwork congestion made miners' fees very high. In other words, if many\ntransactions are happening in the system, the miners' fees would likely be\nvery high due to the congestion. That's comparable to Uber rates during rush\nhour.\n\nTo put things into perspective, in April and May 2021, many transactions were\nhappening on the market, making fees as high as $50. They were also very high\nback at the end of 2017 when Bitcoin hit a price record shy of $20,000.\n\nImagine you want to send a friend $20 worth of Bitcoin, but the fee alone\ncosts $50. Transaction fees like that would make you not want to use it,\nexcept for larger transactions. People began to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon\nwhen its price skyrocketed. All that activity led to high miners' fees, which\ncaused a lot of complaints. Now, fees are generally much lower.\n\nThe number of inputs on a transaction could also cause higher fees. If you\nsend some Bitcoin and it's broken up into smaller pieces, these smaller pieces\nadd more memory to the transaction. That means they'll be processed with a\nlarger memory size, and the miners' fees will increase as they incur a higher\ncost.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room. Why do fees exist, to begin with?\n\nThese fees give incentives to the miners to verify the blocks. Miners verify\neach block using mining machines that crunch the numbers on the cryptographic\npuzzles. When the miners complete a block, they receive some Bitcoin as a\nreward.\n\nRegarding rewards, miners can prioritize which transactions they include in a\nblock. The higher the miner fee, the higher the chances the miner will include\nit in the current block. In some cases, if your transaction carries a lower\nfee, it might take a few blocks until a miner picks up your transaction, puts\nit into a block, and verifies it. That way, the mining system is incentivized\nfor the miners, too.\n\nBitcoin blockchain can only progress with the miners who complete\ntransactions. That's why the miners and their fees are critical to the Bitcoin\necosystem.\n\nAnother important thing to mention is how to pay the miners' fees. Don't\nworry: most wallets will include that in your transaction. They'll deduct the\nminers' fees from the amount you're sending.\n\n## What Can You Do with Bitcoin?\n\nYou can use crypto for trading, buying things, paying people, sending and\nreceiving Bitcoin worldwide, and doing what most people do, invest and save.\nBitcoin is an excellent store of value because it gains so much value over a\nshort time. Since it appreciates so quickly, it's a great hedge against\ninflation, which the world is seeing a lot of now. Bitcoin is dubbed digital\ngold, which is crazy when you think about it! It's even more than digital gold\nbecause it's worth so much!\n\nSome countries are embracing Bitcoin to save their economy. El Salvador got an\nidea to make Bitcoin an official currency alongside their national currency.\nIn Turkey, people also are adopting Bitcoin after inflation and a plummeting\nLira destroyed purchasing power.\n\n## Bitcoin Resources\n\n### Atomic Wallet\n\nCheck the latest wallets and digital assets on Atomic Wallet on our website.\nInstall Atomic on a PC or mobile device with just one click.
