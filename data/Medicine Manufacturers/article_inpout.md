However, based on the available information, it is clear that Access to Medicine Foundation focuses on providing affordable medicines through the production and distribution of generic and biosimilar versions of off-patent drugs. On the other hand, EMpr.com offers a specific pricing plan for Repatha at $5,850 per year, and operates through a subscription and advertising business model.\n\nIt is important to note that the lack of pricing information from the majority of the manufacturers makes it challenging to provide a comprehensive comparison."
