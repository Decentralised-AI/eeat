Here\u2019s How Drug Prices Are Set\n\n# Why Does Medicine Cost So Much? Here\u2019s How Drug Prices Are Set\n\nGetty Images\n\nBy Laura Entis\n\nApril 9, 2019 10:00 AM EDT\n\nFrom 2007 to 2016, Mylan raised the list price of its EpiPen about 500%, from\njust under $100 to more than $600. From 2002 to 2013, insulin prices more than\ntripled. From 2012 to 2019, the average price of AbbVie\u2019s rheumatoid-arthritis\ndrug Humira climbed from $19,000 a year to $60,000 a year\u2014and that\u2019s after\nrebates. These are dramatic examples of a systemwide problem: prices for\nbrand-name drugs are rising at a rate that far outstrips inflation.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind these rapid price hikes? It\u2019s a simple question with a\ncomplicated answer that involves three central entities: drug manufacturers,\npharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers. Together, they create a\ncomplicated supply chain that helps drive drug prices aggressively upward. \u201cWe\nhave a system that is all engine and no brake,\u201d said Michelle Mello, a\nprofessor at Stanford Law School and a professor of health research and policy\nat Stanford Medicine.\n\nThe amount you pay for a brand-name drug will depend on your insurance plan;\nthe plan\u2019s formulary, or list of drugs it prefers and covers; the size of your\ndeductible; and the deal your insurance company has worked out with the drug\u2019s\nmanufacturer, among dozens of other variables. How such discounts are\nnegotiated is proprietary, carefully guarded by the system\u2019s various players.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of finger-pointing over who is to blame for rising prices,\nparticularly between drug companies and PBMs, or the middlemen that negotiate\nrebates and discounts for health plans.\n\nIt all starts with the manufacturers: companies that develop new treatments\nand conduct clinical trials. There are essentially no regulations governing\nhow drugs are priced. Instead, pharmaceutical companies select a price based\non a drug\u2019s estimated value, which typically translates into what they\n\u201cbelieve the market will bear,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate\nprofessor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Blockbuster first-in-class\ntreatments, therefore, command stratospheric prices. When Gilead Sciences\nreceived Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its hepatitis\nmedication Sovaldi in 2013, the company priced it at $1,000 a pill, or $84,000\nfor the full course of treatment. The price was possible because the drug\nworked and, for a time, was the most convenient and effective treatment on the\nmarket.\n\nFor drugs entering a crowded disease category with multiple other options, the\ncalculus is different. In such cases, a new treatment will typically be priced\nsimilarly to its competitors.\n\nThe dollar amount a manufacturer assigns a drug is the list price, and\nfunctions \u201clike a sticker price on a car,\u201d said Mello. The pharmaceutical\ncompany will, depending on the drug and buyer, provide a variety of discounts\noff the list price.\n\nRebates for commercial, employer-sponsored or self-insured health plans,\nnegotiated by PBMs on behalf of the insurers, can get confusing, but the\nprocess broadly goes like this: Say a manufacturer offers a drug with a list\nprice of $1,000 for a month\u2019s supply. Wholesalers pay the manufacturer the\nfull or close to the full price and make it available to pharmacies. From the\nmanufacturers\u2019 point of view, that\u2019s as far as things would need to go:\nthey\u2019ve put a drug on the market and gotten paid for it. But there would be\nlittle demand for the drug if insurance companies didn\u2019t make it available to\nconsumers by listing it on their formularies, and employer-sponsors weren\u2019t\nmaking the insurance available to their employees.\n\nIt\u2019s the PBMs that negotiate with the manufacturers and insurers to get drugs\nlisted and to establish prices. For that work, the manufacturers pay a fee in\nthe form of a rebate\u2014say, $400 off that $1,000 drug. One of two things then\nhappens to that $400: Either the PBM takes a share of it, say $40, and passes\nthe rest of the savings on to the insurance plan\u2019s employer-sponsor. Or the\nPBM pays the entire $400 to the sponsor, but raises the fee it charges the\ninsurer to conduct the price negotiations in the first place.\n\nEither way, the drug now has a net price of $600, or the amount the\nmanufacturer actually makes on its sale. The consumer with health insurance\npays an amount that ranges from a fixed co-pay to some percentage of the full\nlist price, depending on the terms of the plan and whether deductibles have\nbeen met. For many patients, out-of-pocket costs can be cut further by coupons\nthe manufacturer distributes through doctors or online, which can make\npatients likelier to ask for a certain drug by name.\n\nWhen the buyer is the government, discounts are typically standardized. The\nprice Medicare pays for a branded drug that is self-administered (taken at\nhome instead of administered in a clinical setting, like chemotherapy) is\nbased on the average sales price of that drug across different health plans,\ntaking into consideration all discounts and rebates. Medicaid gets a better\ndeal: the government insurance program is entitled by law to receive either\n23.1% off the manufacturer\u2019s list price or the drug\u2019s largest commercial\ndiscount, whichever is lower. In the case of the $1,000 drug, a 23.1% discount\nwould mean a $769 net price, compared with the $600 price negotiated by PBMs\nand insurers, so Medicaid pays the $600.\n\nThis complex system becomes even more so, thanks mostly to the power of the\nPBMs. Not only do they wrangle rebates and discounts from the manufacturers in\nexchange for getting their drugs placed on the insurance companies\u2019\nformularies, they also help determine where on the formulary hierarchy any\ndrug will be. An insurance plan may cover, for example, three psoriasis drugs,\nbut they are on different tiers. A drug on a preferred tier will have a larger\nrebate, making it cheaper for patients. Ideally, drugs would be tiered only\naccording to their effectiveness, and there is certainly an element of that in\nthe mix, especially for patients with Medicare. But a lot of it has to do with\nwhich manufacturers are willing to offer the greatest discounts.\n\nTo force a manufacturer\u2019s hand, PBMs may also practice formulary exclusion, in\nwhich they remove one of the medications in a disease category altogether. If\na drug is not on a formulary, patients are usually on the hook for the full\nlist price\u2014which most won\u2019t pay if there is a competing drug available. Price\npressure intensifies as companies scramble not to get cut.\n\nWhen the system is working, PBMs do perform a service, getting manufacturers\nto lower costs. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have an entity called a PBM, you would want to\ncreate one,\u201d said Geoffrey Joyce, chair of the department of pharmaceutical\nand health economics at the University of Southern California School of\nPharmacy.\n\nBut as it exists today, the system isn\u2019t designed to prioritize savings for\npatients. A big reason for this is that PBMs are not incentivized to negotiate\nfor lower list prices as much as they are for higher rebates, since the share\nof those refunds they keep is a part of how they make their money.\nManufacturers, competing to secure high formulary tiers, know PBMs want juicy\nrebates. And so they have two options: offer a larger discount and make less\nmoney on the drug, or offer a larger discount while also raising the list\nprice of the drug, therefore keeping the net price level. If you\u2019re a\nmanufacturer, you\u2019re going to pick the latter option. Little of this is\nevident to the average consumer.\n\nLet\u2019s return to that $1,000 drug. If the manufacturer raises the rebate it is\noffering the PBM from $400 to $500, it will likely also raise the list price\nby at least $100 to avoid taking a hit on the drug\u2019s net price. That\u2019s good\nfor the PBM; neutral for patients with good health insurance; and bad for\nthose who pay co-insurance, are on high-deductible plans or are uninsured, as\nthe list price is now $1,100.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of concern that those incentives are somewhat perverse,\u201d said\nRachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St.\nLouis.\n\nInsulin pricing is an especially cautionary example. The drug\u2019s average cost\nhas nearly doubled since 2012. \u201cThe increase in the list price has been\nstunning,\u201d said Karen Van Nuys, a research assistant professor at the USC\nPrice School of Public Policy. Today, insulin is so expensive that some people\nare rationing their supplies, which comes with serious, potentially deadly\nrisks.\n\nIn a 2018 article published in _Diabetes Care,_ Van Nuys and colleagues\ntracked the list prices for insulin against the net prices, or the amount\nmanufacturers actually received. They found that from 2002 to 2013, list\nprices for insulin nearly tripled\ufffd\ufffdwhile increases in net prices during that\nperiod were far less significant. (In some cases, those net prices even went\ndown.) The reason: most of the increase went to rebates that the PBMs and plan\nsponsors got to keep. Many insured patients paying only the net price might\nnot have noticed the difference, but uninsured patients, or those with\ninsurance but with deductibles still to meet, were stuck with the soaring list\nprices.\n\nOn top of secretive agreements with manufacturers, PBMs have separate,\nconfidential contracts with health insurers and employers. Large employer-\nsponsors, because of their size, can demand favorable terms, said Richard\nEvans, general manager of SSR\u2019s health practice, such as stipulating that they\nreceive all rebates. But like PBMs, insurers are feeling public heat for\nholding on to rebates. Last year, Aetna and UnitedHealthcare announced they\nwould start passing rebates down to patients\u2014at least ones in higher-end\ninsurance plans.\n\nManufacturers argue that the public\u2019s focus on list prices is misplaced, since\ndrug costs are discounted as they move through the supply chain. While this is\ntechnically true, the list prices do matter. Not only do uninsured patients\nand those who haven\u2019t met their deductibles have to pay that amount in full,\npatients with co-insurance often face out-of-pocket expenses that are based on\na percentage of the list price, not on the discounted price.\n\nWhat can be done to stop or slow the rate at which drug prices are increasing?\nAs of yet, there are virtually no regulations preventing manufacturers from\nsetting and raising prices as high as the market will bear, nor are there\npolicies preventing PBMs from keeping a percentage of the discounts they\nnegotiate.\n\nPublic anger, however, is reaching a boiling point. The Trump Administration\nhas floated the idea of eliminating Medicare rebates, essentially forcing PBMs\nto pass negotiated discounts down to patients. (While this would lower the\nout-of-pocket expense for patients on high-cost brand drugs, it might increase\noverall costs in the form of higher premiums.)\n\nIn late February, seven pharmaceutical executives testified before Congress\nabout rising drug prices. Their showdown with lawmakers was more muted than\nexpected, but many experts believe the groundwork is being laid for\nsubstantive legislative action, if not in the next couple years, then in the\nnext half a dozen.\n\nChanging the system won\u2019t be easy. There\u2019s a lot of money on the line, and the\nhealth care industry is preparing for a fight: PhRMA, the pharmaceutical\nindustry\u2019s most powerful influence arm, spent nearly $28 million in lobbying\nefforts last year, a record-breaking total for the group. (PCMA, the lobbying\ngroup for PBMs, spent a far smaller, but not insignificant, amount in the low\nseven figures.)\n\nThose lobbying efforts are going into overdrive because the drug-supply chain\nis facing real pressure as health care costs have become a rare bipartisan\nissue. \u201cOver the last two years there has been increasing recognition by state\nand federal legislatures that something needs to be done,\u201d Kesselheim said.\n\nConsumers and patients\u2014it\u2019s worth remembering\u2014are also voters. That makes them\none link in the supply chain that Washington ignores at its peril.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * For Antony Blinken,  the War in Gaza Is a Test of U.S. Power\n  * India\u2019s Ayodhya Temple Is a Huge Monument to Hindu Supremacy\n  * How Trump Took Control of the GOP Primary\n  * Jane Fonda: You Can\u2019t Have Healthy People On a Sick Planet\n  * Inside the Casting of  The Traitors Season Two\n  * Eric Adjepong: Letting My History Guide How I Cook\n  * Taylor Swift Is TIME's 2023 Person of the Year\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
