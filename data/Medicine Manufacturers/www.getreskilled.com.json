This helps us to spot\nany potential issues early. There is a \u201cProgress Bar \u201con your course which is\nhelpful to you and us to know how you are doing.\n\nYou have a dedicated course leader who will follow up with you if it looks\nlike you\u2019re starting to fall behind. She\u2019ll also be in touch weekly to let you\nknow when new content is open for you.\n\n#### ____This all sounds way to good to be true. What's the catch?\n\nPharma and med device jobs are stable, secure and well-paid and hence there\ncan be a lot of competition for these jobs. In addition, the recruitment\nprocesses for many companies in this sector is generally multistep, rigorous\nand slow. It can often takes months.\n\nMost people drastically underestimate the number of job applications and\ninterviews required, along with the waiting time and persistence needed to\nfind a job. This is especially true if you are coming from the construction or\nservice sector where you can often get hired quickly or even on the spot.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in an area where there are a large amount of pharmaceutical\nor medical device factories located within commuter distance, you may need to\nmove to find work.\n\n#### ____Is only 10 weeks of training really enough to get a job in pharma and\nmed device manufacturing?\n\nYes, it\u2019s enough to get you the job. However, once you start work, you can\nexpect months of detailed on the job training (6 months is not uncommon)\nbefore being left to work unsupervised on the factory floor. As a matter of\nfact, it doesn\u2019t matter what your technical background is. Every company has\ndifferent standard operating procedures (SOPs) so all new employees\nirrespective of their experience have to undergo some form of on the job\ntraining.\n\n#### ____Is this program delivered online?\n\nYes, this program is delivered fully online.\n\n#### ____What does a typical week look like?\n\nEach week of online content typically includes 6-10 topics.\n\nEach topic includes:\n\n  * A set of course notes \u2013 these provide additional depth to the video content.\n  * Warm-up self-assessment question \u2013 to recap or activate any relevant prior learning.\n  * A video \u2013 these are typically 5-10 minutes long and deliver 80% of the course content.\n  * Post video self-assessment questions to check how well you can recall this new material from memory. If you can\u2019t answer these questions, you should revisit that topic\u2019s learning materials.\n  * Any follow up assessments or assignments.\n\n#### ____What's the main goal of this program?\n\nThe main goal of this program is to retrain you to find an entry-level or\nstarter job within the pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturing industry\nas quickly as possilbe. Please note that if you want to move beyond entry-\nlevel positions, you are going to need to upskill further.\n\nThe program is broken into two modules:\n\n**Module 1**  \nYou\u2019ll learn about the systems used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. You\u2019ll\nlearn about the rules and regulations that need to be followed. And you\u2019ll\nlearn enough technical information to get you talking to employers.\n\n**Module 2**  \nThis is the career bit. In this module, you\u2019ll navigate your way, step by\nstep, through the job hunting process. This specially-designed module is\nindustry-specific. By the end of it, you\u2019ll know which jobs you\u2019d be perfect\nfor, where to find them, and how to make applications to give yourself the\nbest chance at success.\n\n####  __ __How many hours a week must I do for the course?\n\nMost students report between 8-14 hours per week.\n\n#### ____Do I need to be online all the time?\n\nNo you don\u2019t.
