For example, there have been\nlimited changes in R&D pipeline.\n\nGo to Industry Trends\n\nCEO Jayasree K. Iyer's take on the Index\n\n## Beyond COVID-19: learning the lessons on equitable access\n\nRead more\n\n## Subrankings\n\n### Governance of Access\n\nThe top spot is held by Pfizer. The company provides evidence of well-\nestablished structures of governance and management, with responsibility\nassigned and access-to-medicine incentives offered at the highest level, It\ntakes a strong approach to ensuring ethical business practices, and also has\nstringent compliance processes across its operations. Joint for second place\nare AstraZeneca, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Takeda.\n\n### Research & Development\n\nThe top spot is retained by GSK, followed closely by Johnson & Johnson and\nNovartis. Out of all 20 companies, GSK has the largest number of projects in\ndevelopment that target priority diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS.\nJohnson & Johnson and Novartis also engage in R&D for priority diseases, with\nboth companies having access plans for LMICs covering all late-stage R&D\nprojects in the pipeline.\n\n### Product Delivery\n\nAstraZeneca takes the top spot in Product Delivery, leading in its approach to\npatent transparency and sharing of intellectual property assets. It has made\nprogress by licensing and transferring technology for its COVID-19 vaccine.\nGSK and Johnson & Johnson complete the top three, performing well across all\nassessment criteria, including equitable access strategies. Novartis comes\n4th; notably, in 2022 it became the first company to agree to a non-exclusive\nvoluntary licence for a medicine to treat a non-communicable disease.\n\n## Ranking Analysis\n\n### Four companies stand out as leaders\n\nIn the 2022 Index, GSK retains the number one spot, followed closely by\nJohnson & Johnson. AstraZeneca has risen to third, with Novartis in fourth.\nThese four companies are the clear leaders among the companies assessed by the\nIndex...\n\nGSK (1st) tops both the overall ranking and the R&D sub-ranking. The company\ndevelops treatments and vaccines for diseases that disproportionally affect\npeople in LMICs. It is also in the top three of the other two Technical Areas,\nand its access-to-medicine strategy is central to its approach to ensuring\nthat medicines reach those that need them most.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (2nd) demonstrates strong performance in all three Technical\nAreas and performs well across all assessment criteria including access\nstrategies, R&D access planning and capacity building.\n\nAstraZeneca (3rd) has newly joined the top three, ranking as the number one\ncompany in the Product Delivery Technical Area by excelling in its approach to\npatent transparency and technology transfers. The company also performs highly\nin Governance of Access. Novartis (4th) performs well in R&D access planning\nand equitable access strategies and was the first company to agree a non-\nexclusive voluntary licence covering a product for a non-communicable disease.\n\nRead more\n\n### High-performing companies\n\nThe companies ranked 5th to 10th are high performers on access to medicine,\ncompeting closely in the overall ranking. Merck (5th) excels in R&D access\nplanning, with access plans in place for all late-stage R&D projects and\nperforms strongly its approach to patent transparency. Pfizer (6th) leads in\nGovernance of Access for its approach to incentivising responsible promotional\npractices. Takeda (7th) is a top performing company in R&D access planning and\nequitable access strategies for products that are administered by healthcare\npractitioners...\n\nSanofi (8th) performs well in engaging in supranational procurement mechanisms\nto supply products in LMICs they also engage in R&D neglected diseases that\ndisproportionally affect people in poorer countries. Bayer (9th) has joined\nthe top ten, improving its performance in R&D access planning and\ndemonstrating best practice with the broad geographic reach of its plans.\nRoche (10th) engages in high quality health system strengthening initiatives\nand has improved in its approach to R&D access planning.\n\nRead more\n\n### Middle-performing companies\n\nNovo Nordisk (11th) has strong policies governing access and builds capacity\nby engaging in health systems strengthening. Eisai (12th) has an average\nperformance overall across the three Technical Areas, with a particularly\nstrong performance in long-term product donations. Boehringer Ingelheim (13th)\nhas an average performance in the Technical Areas, but has introduced a\ncomprehensive new framework for R&D access planning, and performs well in\nexpanding access via inclusive business models...\n\nGilead (14th) is a leading company in non-exclusive voluntary licensing, but\nits performance in R&D and Governance of Access is below average. Bristol\nMyers Squibb (15th) has greatly improved its ranking this year, strengthening\nits performance in Product Delivery through engaging in health systems\nstrengthening and access strategies. In R&D it is carrying out several\nclinical trials in countries in scope and commits to registering successful\nR&D candidates in those countries.\n\nRead more\n\n### Low-performing companies\n\nThe bottom of the ranking is rounded out by five companies whose performance\nis below average for much for criteria assessed by the Index. Astellas (16th)\nhas strengthened its access planning processes during R&D and has\ncomparatively strong policies in place for Governance of Access, but falls\nbehind its peers in applying equitable access strategies to its products in\nLMICs. Daiichi Sankyo (17th) performs relatively well in intellectual property\n(IP) sharing, but lags in all Technical Areas...\n\nMSD (18th) has improved in R&D with the introduction of a new access planning\npolicy. Yet is has a comparatively poor performance in the other two Technical\nAreas, Governance of Access and Product Delivery, and is among the least\ntransparent companies in scope. AbbVie (19th) scores poorly across all\nTechnical Areas but particularly lags in R&D, in both product development and\nR&D access planning. Eli Lilly (20th) performs poorly, ranking in the bottom\nfive in all three Technical Areas. The company chooses not to disclose\ninformation across a range of issues, nor to make relevant information\navailable in the public domain.\n\nRead more\n\n## How companies were assessed in the 2022 Index\n\nThe 2022 Access to Medicine Index assesses 20 of the world\u2019s largest\npharmaceutical companies in relation to their efforts to expand access to\nmedicine for people living in 108 low- and middle-income countries.

The 2021 AMR Benchmark pinpointed 3-5 tailored\nOpportunities for each of the 17 pharmaceutical companies in scope,\nidentifying specific ways for companies to do more to curb AMR and improve\naccess to antimicrobial products in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  \n\nIn November 2023, using data submitted by companies and information from the\npublic domain, the Foundation published a report that provides a vital update\non the progress achieved by these 17 companies in with regards to each of\ntheir Opportunities.  \n\n## Findings in 2023\n\nThe industry analysis in the November 2023 report reveals collective trends,\nboth in terms of action and inaction, shedding light on the factors that have\ninfluenced the extent of progress achieved thus far \u2013 and where more action is\nrequired from companies. For Opportunities related to access, some progress\ncan be seen among companies \u2013 especially in expanding product registration and\nengaging in long-term initiatives to boost availability and affordability.\nHowever, despite a handful of acquisitions to expand R&D pipelines, R&D\nprojects targeting priority pathogens and urgent AMR threats are still\nlacking, and there has been no progress on Opportunities to delink bonuses\nfrom sales volume.\n\nTo full analysis\n\nDownload the full report\n\n## Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark 2021\n\nDownload\n\n## 2021 Benchmark \u2013 Trends\n\n### Good practice is becoming more common. Action to address access lags\nbehind.\n\nGood practice is most notable in the plans to ensure wider access to and\nresponsible use of future products, as well as in the steps taken to curb the\nrelease of antibiotic waste into the environment. In stewardship, generic\nmedicine manufacturers are taking a more active role. However, all companies\nmiss opportunities to improve access in low- and middle-income countries\n(LMICs), where the need is greatest and where people face the greatest threat\nfrom superbug infections.\n\nTo full analysis\n\n## 2021 Benchmark \u2013 scoring companies\n\nThe goal of the Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark is to guide and incentivise\npharmaceutical companies to do more to tackle drug resistance and ensure\nappropriate access to antibiotics, antifungals and other antimicrobial\nproducts. It identifies good ideas for limiting AMR and highlights where\naction is still required.  \n\nThe methodology for the 2021 Benchmark was developed after consultation with\nan Expert Committee, as well as many other global health stakeholders, and was\npublished in October 2020. The 2021 Benchmark evaluated 17 companies,\nincluding 8 large research-based companies and 9 generic medicine\nmanufacturers, looking at their performance across a set of 20 metrics. To\nfairly score and compare the companies, the Benchmark evaluated them only in\nthose metrics that were relevant to their portfolio and pipelines.\n\nRead the methodology for the 2021 Benchmark\n\n## 2021: Insights - Research & Development\n\n### GSK maintains lead in antibacterial and antifungal R&D to target priority\npathogens\n\nGSK's pipeline is the largest evaluated, with 31 projects in the pipeline. It\naddresses more pathogens designated as \u2018critical\u2019 and/or \u2018urgent\u2019 threats, and\nhas most vaccines projects underway.\n\nTo the best practice\n\n### R&D pipeline grows, but remains small overall\n\nSince the previous analysis, 22 projects have left the pipeline, but there\nhave been 38 additions. As a result, the pipeline has modestly increased in\nsize, by 15 projects, from 77 to 92.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Sustained R&D for AMR from most companies\n\nOnly one of the eight companies evaluated is not currently active in R&D\ntargeting priority pathogens. The remaining seven have sustained their\ninvolvement, and several have expanded their pipelines. Pfizer and GSK stand\nout for adding five and four projects, respectively.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Which pathogens are receiving most attention in R&D\n\nThe World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control have\nidentified the most dangerous pathogens due to resistance. The eight large\nresearch-based companies evaluated are developing 92 medicine and vaccine\nprojects that target them.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n## 2021: Insights - Responsible manufacturing\n\n### Progress on limiting antibiotic waste in environment\n\nMore companies are setting and enforcing limits for antibacterial material\nthat can be released in manufacturing wastewaters. Companies generally perform\nbest at implementing these limits at their own factories. However, just 5.2%\nof third-party manufacturing sites are reported as compliant.\n\nTo the key finding\n\n### More companies require suppliers to set AMR limits\n\nCompanies generally perform best at setting and monitoring specific AMR-\nrelated environmental standards at their own manufacturing sites. For the\nfirst time, the Benchmark reports that three generic medicine companies now\nrequire suppliers also meet such standards.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Shionogi is first to publish the details of its antibacterial waste-\nmanagement performance\n\nShionogi has published information on audit results covering wastewater\nmanagement, solid-waste management and discharge limits. Its disclosure covers\nall antibacterial APIs and/or drug products produced at its site in Japan and\nat supplier sites.\n\nTo the best practice\n\n### How pharma companies manage antibacterial waste\n\nMany factories around the world are involved in the production of\nantibacterials, with many based in India and China. If these manufacturing\nsites do not manage their waste appropriately, the discharge of wastewaters\ncontaining active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment can\ntrigger resistance.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n## 2021: Insights - Appropriate access & stewardship\n\n### Improvement in antimicrobial sales practices, especially from generics\ncompanies\n\nWhen sales agents\u2019 bonuses are linked to how much antibacterial and antifungal\nmedicine is sold, this acts as an incentive for these staff to oversell in\norder to increase their own pay. In 2021, more generic medicine manufacturers\nare taking action to combat overselling.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Tech transfers are being carried out as isolated, yet valuable,\ninitiatives\n\nTo support the development of local manufacturing in low and middle income\ncountries, pharma companies can invest in capacity building and technology\ntransfers. Half of the on-patent vaccines analysed are subject to a technology\ntransfer initiative. Very few initiatives cover any of the 148 medicines\nanalysed.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Most companies support efforts to track resistance\n\nTo control the spread of resistance, it is important to track cases and\ninfection rates. Most companies are engaged in surveillance to some extent:\nall of the eight large research-based companies evaluated, except Otsuka, and\nthree generic medicine manufacturers, Abbott, Cipla and Viatris.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n### Slow progress on expanding product registrations to low- and middle-income\ncountries\n\nLess wealthy nations often have the highest need for new medicines arriving on\nthe market. Yet only six of the sampled on-patent medicines have been filed in\nten or more of the 102 low- and middle-income countries prioritised for this\nanalysis.\n\nTo the analysis\n\n## Marijn Verhoef\n\nDirector of Operations and Research\n\nmverhoef@accesstomedicinefoundation.org\n\nGet in touch\n\nThe Generic & Biosimilar Medicines Programme 2023: Company Profiles is the\nfirst report to be published by the Access to Medicine Foundation\u2019s Generic &\nBiosimilars Medicines Programme. It assesses what five major generic and\nbiosimilar medicine manufacturers \u2013 Cipla, Hikma, Sun Pharma, Teva, and\nViatris \u2013 are doing to expand access to their essential products in low- and\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs). Collectively, these five companies have a\nwide portfolio of essential medicines and a well-established presence in\nLMICs. Given their portfolios and footprints, the actions of these companies\ncan have a huge impact.\n\n  * Cipla Ltd\n  * Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc\n  * Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd\n  * Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd\n  * Viatris Inc\n\nDownload the full report\n\n## Generic & Biosimilar Medicines Programme- 2023 Company Profiles\n\nDownload\n\n## Insights\n\nThe report identifies opportunities for each company to significantly enhance\nits impact and contribute to improving access to medicine in LMICs, with\nrecommendations tailored to the specific circumstances of each company, as\nwell as its portfolio, geographical reach and size. Standout examples\nhighlight good practice and show possibilities for progress. By extending\nproduct registration, fine-tuning access strategies, and adopting pricing\nstrategies that factor in end-users\u2019 ability to pay, companies can enhance\ntheir impact. Strengthening supply chains, local manufacturing, and adaptive\nR&D efforts, such as adapting products for children or warm environments, also\noffer promising pathways to ensuring access.\n\nRead the key findings from the report\n\nCEO Jayasree K. Iyer's take on access to generics\n\n## The untapped potential of the generics industry\n\nRead more\n\n## How the framework was developed\n\nThese five companies are the first to be assessed using the Analytical\nFramework, which was published in February 2023 as part of the Foundation\u2019s\nnew Generic & Biosimilar Medicines Programme. The framework assesses companies\nin terms of their individual capability to expand access to medicine within\n108 LMICs and relating to 82 diseases and 102 products, with actions analysed\nacross three Research Areas: Expanding access; Supply & quality; and Research\n& Development.  \n\nA rigorous process was undertaken to ensure the assessment criteria were\nrobust and relevant for companies. Proposals were reviewed by an **_Expert\nCommittee_**, which provided strategic guidance. Insights were also drawn from\na first-of-its kind **_workshop_**, which brought together experts working\nwith and within the generic medicine industry, and focused on opportunities to\nexpand access to medicine beyond companies' conventional roles in\nmanufacturing and supplying affordable generic medicines.\n\nDownload the framework\n\n## The 2023 Analytical Framework for the Generic & Biosimilar Medicines\nProgramme\n\nRead more\n\n## Next steps\n\nBy design, generic and biosimilar versions of medicines are intended to be\nmore affordable and accessible than the originator product, and there is now\nan opportunity for companies to go further by leveraging their capacity and\nexpertise to ensure their products reach the people who need them. The\nstandout examples identified in this report span the different research areas\nassessed by the Framework \u2013 including examples of partnerships, solutions, and\nother ways companies are working on expanding access and availability in\nLMICs.\n\nCompanies can now work to enhance their own efforts to improve access based on\nthe research findings and the Opportunities outlined in their respective\nCompany Profiles. The findings set out in the report also demonstrate where\nother companies may be able to learn from their peers and adopt similar\npositive actions, where relevant, to further improve access and make products\nmore available and affordable to people living in LMICs.\n\n## Claudia Mart\u00ednez\n\nHead of Research\n\ncmartinez@accesstomedicinefoundation.org\n\nGet in touch\n\n  * Download the report\n  * Insights\n  * Download the analytical framework\n  * Next steps\n\n## Access to Medicine Foundation\n\nInterested in our work?\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n## Access to Medicine Foundation is funded by\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nCopyright 2004 - 2022 Access to Medicine Foundation - All Rights Reserved\n\n",

As an integral part of the sector\u2019s business model, they provide\nlarge quantities of medicines, and sell them at lower prices and smaller\nprofit margins than originator companies. These companies primarily focus on\nproducing and distributing generic or biosimilar versions of off-patent drugs\n\u2013 a category that includes most of the essential medicines. Some of these\ncompanies are also involved in manufacturing in-licensed products (i.e. on-\npatent medicines) via licensing agreements with originator companies, meaning\nthat newer medicines can reach more people, in more countries, at more\naffordable prices.\n\nHowever, while the low cost/high volume approach can inherently help expand\naccess globally major challenges exist with both affordability and\navailability of essential medicines in LMICs. For example, even if a generic\nmedicine (whether off-patent or in-licensed) is priced lower than the\noriginator, it still may be unaffordable to large numbers of the patients who\nneed it, especially those who rely on the private market and pay out-of-\npocket. Another barrier to access is availability; for example, a company may\ntarget the most lucrative markets and not make its product available in many\nLMICs, in which case health systems and patients in those countries cannot\ntake advantage of more affordable generic options.\n\n **What is an access strategy?** The range of mechanisms that a company can\nimplement to provide access to its products for a specific group of patients\nwithin a country. Access strategies with the biggest potential impact in terms\nof equitable access are those that aim to promote affordable access to\nmedicine for all segments of the population by considering the payer\u2019s ability\nto pay, and those that take the needs and characteristics of healthcare\nsystems into account.\n\n**How were companies\u2019 access strategies assessed?** To understand how\ncompanies tailor their access strategies to reach people in LMICs, a sample of\nten products from each of the five companies\u2019 portfolios were selected for\nspecific analysis. For each of the ten products, one example of a country-\nspecific access strategy for that product was analysed.\n\n### Lack of comprehensive access strategies targeting vulnerable patients\n\nGeneric and biosimilar medicine manufacturers can take deliberate steps to\nimprove access to their products in LMICs \u2013 engaging in \u201caccess strategies\u201d\nthat promote affordability and availability. All five companies in scope of\nthis analysis \u2013 Cipla, Hikma, Sun Pharma, Teva and Viatris \u2013 are implementing\nstrategies to expand the reach of their products in LMICs, with examples of\naccess strategies identified for 41 of the 50 products analysed in this\nassessment.\n\nYet, there is limited evidence that companies are considering affordability\nfor different payers when setting prices for their products. Payers can\ninclude public and private entities, organisations and patients paying out-of-\npocket. Among the 41 access strategies, only 14 targeted both the public and\nprivate sectors and included comprehensive approaches for wider patient reach.\nAmong the remaining 27 strategies, two were donation programmes and 25\nexclusively targeted either the public or private sector, but lacked specific\nelements for improving access for vulnerable populations, including low-income\npatients and paediatric populations.\n\nOut of the 25 strategies, nine target the public sector, with the government\noffering partial or total reimbursement for the products. By engaging in\npublic sector contracts, such as tenders, companies can widen medicine access\nto a large number of patients. However, public payers may not always have\nenough funds to procure sufficient units of the medicine, leading to out-of-\npocket payments. In such cases, companies must ensure that their access\nstrategies consider private sector patients and their ability to pay.\n\n_A sample of maximum of ten products, deemed essentials for public health,\nwere analysed for each company. For each of the ten products, companies were\nrequested to provide one example of a country-specific access strategy\ncovering that product, including a minimum of three low-income countries and\nthree lower-middle income countries. Further examples could come from upper-\nmiddle income countries._\n\n### Tenders are the main strategies used to promote access in the public\nsector\n\nAmong the 41 examples of access strategies submitted by companies, the access\nstrategy most commonly used to promote access in the public sector is to\nengage in tenders, whether that involves a single procurer (e.g. a public\nhealth service) or multiple procurers (i.e. via pooled procurement).\n\nThese mechanisms allow governments and other tender issuers (e.g., public\nhospitals) to secure cost savings by inviting competitive bidding from\nmanufacturers. They can also be a way for companies to improve access to their\nproducts in LMICs. Yet, their ability to enhance affordability might be\nrestricted if negotiation is limited or market competition is lacking.\nMoreover, at times, manufacturing and distributing expenses for companies\nmight exceed public sector payments, posing challenges to the viability of the\nbusiness case.\n\nFour companies reported using public sector tenders in countries in scope to\nexpand access to the products selected for analysis. Additionally, two\ncompanies engage in supranational procurement to mitigate commercial risks and\nexpand access to products. The access strategy examples shared by Viatris for\nfour of its assessed products included participation in supranational\nprocurement to expand access to the product \u2013 with examples submitted for\nMalawi, Namibia, Uganda and Zambia. Additionally, Cipla reports supplying\nabacavir/ lamivudine, an antiretroviral procured through the Global Fund to\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in at least one LMIC (Benin).\n\n_Companies utilise a variety of strategies to provide access, including\ntenders, pricing strategies, donations and patient assistance programmes. Of\nthe 41 products, 14 have comprehensive access strategies, which include more\nthan one component from the graph._\n\n### Competitor-based pricing and local price controls shape private sector\npricing\n\nCollectively, the companies submitted 24 examples that included strategies\nfocused on pricing in the private sector \u2013 specifically competitor-based\npricing and/or local pricing control mechanisms.\n\nFor 17 of these 24 products, the country-specific examples of access\nstrategies indicated that the product was only available through the private\nsector. For instance, in the examples provided for four antihypertensive\nmedicines (telmisartan in Zambia, valsartan in Sudan, metoprolol in Nepal, and\nlisinopril in Nigeria), the companies supplied these products solely in the\nprivate sector. In these countries, only a small percentage of the population\n(around 3%) is covered by private insurance, meaning most pay out-of-pocket,\nwhile public sector coverage remains inadequate due to governments\u2019 challenges\nin procuring essential products.\n\nUltimately, a company\u2019s use of competitor-based pricing and pricing mechanisms\nin ensuring equitable access might not significantly enhance affordability\nunless the company factors in the payers\u2019 capacity to pay. The analysis\nreveals companies aiming to tackle affordability challenges for lower-income\ngroups through the private sector, for example Viatris is implementing a\npatient assistance programme in India, offering financial support to low-\nincome patients who pay out-of-pocket for the cancer drug bevacizumab.\nHowever, overall examples are limited.\n\n### What needs to happen next?\n\nWhile companies are often incentivised to gain a competitive advantage to\nsecure tenders in the public market or to supply in the private market,\nrelying solely on competitor-based models falls short in terms of securing\nequitable access. Companies can continue to expand their access strategies to\ninclude more products in their portfolios and consider payers\u2019 ability to pay\nin their pricing approaches. Engaging with the public sector is vital,\nencompassing strategies such as intra-country differential pricing for broader\npatient coverage, and participating in specific public sector programmes, such\nas those tackling NCDs. Equally essential is reaching vulnerable populations,\nespecially the 43% of people in the poorest countries facing catastrophic\nhealthcare expenses due to out-of-pocket costs. Lastly, companies can engage\ndirectly with the private sector, such as wholesalers, as well as social\nmarketing organisations, private insurers, and NGOs to ensure medicines are\naccessible and affordable for those that need them.\n\n## Claudia Mart\u00ednez\n\nHead of Research\n\ncmartinez@accesstomedicinefoundation.org\n\nGet in touch\n\n## Resource centre\n\nRead the key findings from our new report on generic medicine manufacturers\n\nKey findings\n\n## Companies have a collectively broad regulatory reach in LMICs, yet many\nessential products are not widely registered\n\n26 September 2023\n\nKey findings\n\n## Despite initiatives to strengthen manufacturing, further efforts needed to\nsafeguard product availability\n\n26 September 2023\n\nKey findings\n\n## Companies are engaging in adaptive R&D, tailoring products to the needs of\npeople in LMICs\n\n26 September 2023\n\n## Access to Medicine Foundation\n\nInterested in our work?\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n## Access to Medicine Foundation is funded by\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nCopyright 2004 - 2022 Access to Medicine Foundation - All Rights Reserved\n\n"
