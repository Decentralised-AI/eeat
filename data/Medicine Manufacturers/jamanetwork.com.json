Participants completed a survey fielded to\n4933 respondents, of whom 3026 respondents started and completed the survey\n(response rate of 61%). Further details on the survey design are described in\nan earlier study using the same sample.5 Our cross-sectional study followed\nthe Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\n(STROBE) reporting guideline and received institutional review board approval\nfrom the University of Southern California. All participants provided\nelectronic informed consent.\n\nThe dependent variable measured individuals\u2019 trust in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 [always distrust] to 5\n[always trust]). Independent variables included demographic characteristics\n(such as gender, race and ethnicity, age, and geographic location) and other\npredisposing factors, including political affiliation, household income,\neducational level, self-reported health, and source of health information\n(including whether they have a regular source of care and whether they rely on\ndigital media for health information).\n\nCharacteristics of individuals with high and low levels of trust were compared\nusing \u03c72 tests. All _P_ values were from 2-sided tests and results were deemed\nstatistically significant at _P_ < .05. The association between demographic\ncharacteristics and trust was estimated using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from\nan ordered logit regression model.\n\nResults\n\nThis cross-sectional study used a nationally representative survey of 2867\nindividuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (mean [SD] age, 54 [7] years;\n1324 women [46%] and 2119 White individuals [74%]). A total of 1145\nindividuals (40%) considered pharmaceutical manufacturers to be sometimes\n(1036 [36%]) or always (109 [4%]) trustworthy (Table 1).\n\nExcellent health (OR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.05-2.75]; _P_ = .03) and having a\nregular source of care (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01-1.40]; _P_ = .03) were\nassociated with higher trust in pharmaceutical manufacturers (Table 2).\nIndividuals with Democratic (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.15-1.61]; _P_ < .001) or\nRepublican party affiliation (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.09-1.49]; _P_ = .003) had\nhigher trust relative to those with Independent affiliation. Relative to the\nwest, individuals in the northeast had higher trust (OR, 1.43 [95% C,\n1.16-1.77]; _P_ = .001). There were no differences across gender, race and\nethnicity, age, income, or educational level.\n\nDiscussion\n\nApproximately 60% of individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease did\nnot trust pharmaceutical manufacturers. Lack of trust was higher among those\nin poor health or without a usual source of care, raising concerns that\nvulnerable populations have experiences where trust has been broken. This also\nraises concerns about poor medication adherence and lack of treatment-seeking\nbehavior in vulnerable populations. Those with Independent political\naffiliation had lower trust than those with Republican or Democratic\naffiliation, suggesting that mainstream political discourse might be\nassociated with pharmaceutical trust. However, those with Independent\naffiliation might represent different ideological backgrounds. There were\nsignificant regional differences, with those in the northeast, where several\npharmaceutical firms have a major presence, having higher trust. Limitations\nto this study include limited generalizability, cross-sectional design, and\nself-reported data in a survey-based design with potential for nonresponse\nbias.\n\nBack to top\n\nArticle Information\n\n**Accepted for Publication:** January 30, 2023.\n\n **Published:** March 14, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.3002\n\n **Open Access:** This is an open access article distributed under the terms\nof the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2023 Singh Y et al. _JAMA Network Open_.\n\n **Corresponding Author:** Yashaswini Singh, MPA, Department of Health Policy\nand Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 (ysingh@jhu.edu).\n\n **Author Contributions:** Ms Singh had full access to all of the data in the\nstudy and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy\nof the data analysis.\n\n _Concept and design:_ All authors.\n\n _Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:_ All authors.\n\n _Drafting of the manuscript:_ Singh.\n\n _Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content:_ All\nauthors.\n\n _Statistical analysis:_ All authors.\n\n _Obtained funding:_ Eisenberg, Sood.\n\n _Supervision:_ Eisenberg, Sood.\n\n **Conflict of Interest Disclosures:** Dr Eisenberg reported receiving grants\nfrom the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Nursing\nResearch, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Arnold Ventures, and\nthe National Institute on Aging outside the submitted work.
