As health systems evolve, patients are being\nasked to take on higher out-of-pocket costs which heighten concerns about\naffordability.\n\nPfizer's approach to medicine pricing is informed by two core principles: that\nmedicines help people live longer, healthier, more productive lives; and that\npatients should have affordable access to the medicines they need.\n\nWe define the value of our therapies by the benefits they offer patients and\nsociety. Our innovative medicines treat complex conditions such as cancer and\nrare diseases, among others, providing immense health benefits for hard-to-\ntreat diseases, and are often safer and more effective than other treatment\noptions.\n\nWe price our medicines by thoughtfully balancing considerations such as\naccess, affordability and the ability to invest in future cures. We advocate\nwith payers for access to our medicines at costs that patients can afford,\noffer discounts, and when there are access or affordability issues, provide\npatient assistance programs.\n\nOur highest priority is making our medicines accessible to patients who need\nthem. Only then can the impact of our science and innovation bring value to\ntheir lives and to those that care for them.\n\n#### Why do drug prices sometimes change?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why medicine prices may change over time. These\nmay include, among others:\n\n  * Discovery of new uses and new patient populations through both trial data and real-world evidence\n  * Changes in local laws and mandates\n  * New or expiring patents\n  * New formulations\n  * Improvements in the manufacturing and supply chain\n  * Market-based factors\n\nGo back to the Home Page\n\n  *   *   * \n\nClose Hide social popup\n\n## Share this page\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\nCopy URL\n\n## Why not also share...\n\nVids Infographics\n\n  * Video\n  * Infographics\n\n## Why not also share...\n\nIan Read: Contributions to Improving Human Health\n\nAlbert Bourla: Breakthroughs that Change Patients' Lives\n\nUshering in a New Era of Pfizer R&D Productivity\n\nAdvancing Our Leading JAK Science\n\nOvercoming Therapy-Resistant Disease\n\nTackling Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Through Breakthrough Science and\nTechnology\n\nCatalyzing Innovations in Global Health\n\nContributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSupporting Digital Health Start-Ups\n\nImproving the Health of Women and Their Families\n\nOur Global Footprint\n\nOur Patient Impact\n\nAdvancing Our Pipeline\n\nCreating Shareholder Value\n\nBeing a Responsible Corporate Citizen\n\nDiscovery projects\n\nA Culture of Colleague Engagement\n\nD&I by the Numbers\n\nHow Pfizer Supports Good Health and Well-Being\n\nGlobal Health Innovations Grants (GHIG) Program\n\n## Explore Our Business\n\n### Understanding the External Environment\n\n### Manufacturing & Supply Chain Excellence\n\n### Our Sustainable Policies & Practices\n\n## Download Our Annual Review\n\n  * Pfizer 2018 Annual Review (6.5MB PDF)\n  * Performance Data (0.5MB PDF)\n\n## Additional Information\n\n  * About This Review\n  * GRI Reference Table\n  * Corporate and shareholder  \ninformation\n\n## Useful links\n\n  * Pfizer.com\n  * Investors\n  * Feedback\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Join Us\n  * Terms of Use\n\n## Connect with us\n\n  * Join us on Facebook\n  * Join us on Twitter\n  * Join us on Instagram\n  * Join us on LinkedIn\n  * Watch us on Youtube\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002-2019 Pfizer Inc.  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nThe product information provided in this site is intended only for residents\nof the United States.
