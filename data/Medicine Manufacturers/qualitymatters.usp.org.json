There has been\nsignificant attention paid to increasing onshoring and reducing reliance on\nforeign countries \u2013 China in particular.\n\nIn 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared data illustrating\nU.S. reliance on foreign active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing\nbased on where facilities were located. The FDA analysis showed that 72\npercent of API facilities supplying the U.S. market are overseas, with 13\npercent in China.\n\nBut has this geographic concentration changed given investments in medicines\nsupply chain resilience over the past two years? Is the U.S. market still\nheavily reliant on foreign suppliers of APIs, even as we continue to invest in\ndomestic API manufacturing and prepare for future crises? Now in year three of\nthe pandemic, questions remain.\n\nTo address these questions, USP used its Medicine Supply Map to assess U.S.\ndependence on foreign API. The Medicine Supply Map identifies, characterizes\nand quantifies risk and resilience in the upstream medicines supply chain to\naid early detection of risk factors that can lead to drug shortages.\n\nThe Medicine Supply Map analytics team used machine learning techniques,\nincluding Natural Language Processing, on FDA data, information from non-U.S.\nregulatory agencies, and its own proprietary insights to map manufacturing\nlocations associated with ~90 percent of active API Drug Master Files (DMFs)\naround the world. DMFs are submitted to FDA by companies when they want to\nsupply drug ingredients to another company without disclosing proprietary\ninformation. FDA publishes the names of companies filing the DMFs. While DMFs\nare commonly utilized in the generics industry, some manufacturers may choose\nto make their own API or not use a DMF. Nevertheless, this mapping provides a\npicture of U.S. reliance on foreign API sources at the end of 2021.\n\nThe USP Medicine Supply Map analysis (Chart I) counts the number of active API\nDMFs by location.\n\n  * India accounts for 48%\n  * China accounts for 13%\n  * U.S. accounts for 10%\n\n**Chart I: Total Active API DMFs, by country, as of 2021**\n\n  \n_Source: US Pharmacopeia Medicine Supply Map_\n\nThe Medicine Supply Map insights also show how U.S. reliance on foreign API\nsources has changed over time (Chart II).\n\n**Chart II: Active API Drug Master Files, by year of filing and country of\nmanufacture**\n\n_Source: US Pharmacopeia Medicine Supply Map_\n\n  * India contributed 62% of active API DMFs filed in 2021, up from 20% filed in 2000. This increase is consistent with the country\u2019s well-publicized national ambition to enhance API manufacturing capabilities.\n  * Europe\u2019s contribution declined from 49% of active API DMFs filed in 2000 to 7% filed in 2021\n  * China contributed 18% of new API DMFs filed in 2019, and 23% filed in 2021\n  * U.S. contributed 4% of new API DMFs filed in 2019 and 2021\n\nSuch information and other insights provided by the USP Medicine Supply Map\nallow it to function as a first-of-its-kind information system for early\nwarning of potential supply chain disruptions. It can be used by governments,\nproviders and manufacturers to prioritize supply chain investments that reduce\ndrug shortages.\n\nQuestions remain from the current analysis, however, when thinking about\nfacets of U.S. reliance on foreign API manufacturers. For example, this\nanalysis does not take volume into account, and it is not clear if certain DMF\nholders are responsible for larger volumes of drugs compared to competitors.\nThe U.S. reliance on other countries for intermediates or raw materials used\nto make APIs is also not clearly understood. USP\u2019s Medicine Supply Map team is\nworking to map critical raw materials for essential APIs to better understand\nwhat risk these factors have for the medicines supply chain.\n\nLearn more about USP\u2019s Medicine Supply Map.\n\nTags:\n\nMedicine Supply Map Insights\n\nMedicines\n\n### Vimala Raghavendran\n\nTwitter\n\n### Most recent contribution\n\nWhy cancer medicines are and continue to be vulnerable to drug shortages\n\n### Matthew Christian\n\nTwitter\n\n### Most recent contribution\n\nWhat\u2019s driving drug shortages during the cold and flu season?\n\n## Get the latest from Quality Matters to your inbox\n\n## You might also like...\n\nSupply Chain\n\n // January 04, 2024\n\n##  Prioritizing Quality Across the Manufacturing Eco-System in India...\n\nIndia is often referred to as the \u2018pharmacy of the world\u2019 and is undeniably\nthe leading manufacturing hub for many of the world\u2019s most essential\nmedicines.\n\nAnthony Lakavage, J.D.\n\nSupply Chain\n\n // December 08, 2023\n\n##  Revisiting the Landscape of Potential Nitrosamines in Pharmaceuticals\nusing CPCA fram...\n\nQuality Matters recently sat down with USP Principal Scientist Naiffer Romero,\nwho has teamed up with researchers at LHASA Limited, AstraZeneca, Sai Life\nSciences and Merck for collaborative research on nitrosamine impurities.
