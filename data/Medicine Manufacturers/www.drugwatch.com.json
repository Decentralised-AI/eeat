I found information that was very helpful, that her\n> psychiatrist never told her.\"\n>\n> **Marianne Zahren** Patient\u2019s Family Member\n\n  *   * \n\nBig Pharma is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global\nrevenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1.42 trillion in 2021. But nowhere else\nin the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and\nmake as much money as in the U.S.\n\nSix of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in 2017 had their headquarters in\nthe U.S. These include Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead, Amgen and\nAbbVie.\n\nBut only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact,\nBig Pharma is the second most hated industry in America. It\u2019s right behind the\ntobacco industry and the oil, gas and chemical industry.\n\nBig Pharma is also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the\nFalse Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.\n\nThe industry has a history of fraud, bribery, lawsuits and scandals. Despite\ncriminal charges and fines, Big Pharma companies continue to do business.\n\n## What Is Big Pharma?\n\nBig Pharma is a term for the world\u2019s largest publicly traded pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\n\nThe biggest drug companies may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical\ndevices. Medical devices can be anything from syringes to hip and knee\nimplants.\n\nPrescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in\nbillions in profits.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are usually larger than companies that focus on\nmedical devices alone. Drug companies also tend to make more money.\n\n## Top Big Pharma Companies By Sales\n\nCompany| 2017 Total Revenue from Pharmaceutical Products (in billions) | 2017\nTotal Revenue (in billions)| Popular Prescription Products  \n---|---|---|---  \nPfizer (U.S.)| $52.5| $52.5| Eliquis, Nexium, Lipitor, Celebrex, Lyrica,\nEpiPen, Viagra, Xeljanz, Zoloft, Zithromax  \nRoche (Switzerland)| $44.4| $57.4| Actemra, Tamiflu, Valium  \nSanofi (France)| $36.7| $42.9| Zantac, Ambien, Dupixent, Lantus, Lemtrada,\nPlavix, Synvisc-One, Taxotere  \nJohnson & Johnson (U.S.)| $36.3| $76.5| Elmiron, Tylenol, Fentanyl, Haldol,\nRisperdal, Invokana, Invokamet, Levaquin, Lexapro, Remicade, Stelara, Topamax,\nXarelto  \nMerck & Co.

The U.S. makes about $148 billion,\naccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce. That\u2019s about half of the world\u2019s\nshare of the market.\n\n__ EXPAND\n\nAmericans spent $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. Drug prices\ncontinue to rise.\n\nAmericans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in\n2015. And drug prices continue to rise.\n\nConsulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices to rise 11.6 percent in\n2017. This estimate is for Americans under the age of 65.\n\nIn contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent. This means many\nAmericans won\u2019t be able to afford their medications.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Who Owns Big Pharma?\n\nWell, the better question is: Who does Big Pharma own?\n\nBig Pharma contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration. Big Pharma does this through application fees (user fees) for\nits new products.\n\nExperts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA\u2019s budget.\n\nBig Pharma also uses its profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists to spread\nits influence on Capitol Hill.\n\nBig Pharma Spending\n\nFor every $1 spent on \u201cbasic research,\u201d Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions\nand advertising.\n\nSource: BMJ\n\nFrom 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses \u2014\nmore than any other industry.\n\nIn 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million. That\u2019s more than the defense\nindustries and corporate business lobbyists combined.\n\nMedical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group. Medical Device\nManufacturers Association contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds in 2016.\n\nIts efforts concentrate on medical-device-friendly bills in Congress. They\nmostly relate to how companies pay taxes.\n\nCritics say Big Pharma relies on manipulative tactics to increase sales. They\nsay it uses expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, FDA and the public.\n\n## Notable Big Pharma Scandals\n\nThe long road to a Vioxx recall is arguably one of the most notable Big Pharma\nscandals in U.S. history.\n\nMerck announced a voluntary worldwide recall of its painkiller in 2004. It\ncame four years after evidence linked the drug to significant health risks.\n\nThe company\u2019s executives decided not to study Vioxx\u2019s cardiovascular risks.\nThe FDA later found the drug may cause an increased risk of heart attack and\nstroke.\n\nMerck paid the U.S. Department of Justice $950 million to resolve criminal\ncharges related to the marketing and sales of Vioxx.\n\nOne agency scientist, Dr. David Graham, estimated that the use of Vioxx may\nhave contributed to more than 27,000 heart attacks or deaths.\n\nBoth Merck and the FDA came under Congressional scrutiny.\n\nIn 2011, Merck pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the marketing and\nsales of Vioxx. The company agreed to pay the U.S. Department of Justice $950\nmillion to resolve its misconduct.\n\nMerck settled with tens of thousands of injured patients in 2007. Merck agreed\nto pay $4.85 billion to plaintiffs and their families.\n\n## Top Big Pharma Lawsuit Verdicts and Settlements\n\nIn a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements for marketing\nfraud. The settlements totaled $35.7 billion.\n\nPublic Citizen published this data in 2013. It called its report\nPharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.\n\nIn 2012, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) agreed to a $3 billion settlement. It was the\nlargest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history.\n\nThe charges stemmed from certain prescription drugs, including Paxil,\nWellbutrin and Avandia. GSK still ranks in the top ten for its pharmaceutical\ndrug profits.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is the world\u2019s largest health care company. It paid $2.2\nbillion in 2013 for improperly marketing its drug Risperdal.\n\n  * **Featured Article**\n\nSelling Side Effects: Big Pharma\u2019s Marketing Machine\n\nJuly 17, 2016\n\nBig Pharma companies were also hit with million- and billion-dollar verdicts.\nThese verdicts rarely impact the companies\u2019 profits.\n\nA jury ordered Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly to pay $9 billion in 2014.\nThe award went to an Actos user who developed bladder cancer.\n\nTakeda still reported an underlying revenue growth of 6.7 percent in 2017. Eli\nLilly saw sales of $22.87 billion the same year.\n\n**If you were seriously injured by a prescription drug or medical device, you\nmay be able to file a lawsuit.** Our Partners __\n\n### Our Trusted Legal Partners\n\nDrugwatch partners with trusted law firms to help you take legal action.

A St. Louis jury awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women, and this\nremains the largest single verdict so far.\n\nJohnson & Johnson announced it would stop selling its talcum powder products\nin the Unites States and Canada in May 2020.\n\n### Billions in Hip Implant Settlements\n\nCompanies have paid billions in hip implant lawsuit settlements to people who\nclaim they were injured by metal-on-metal hip implants.\n\nThe largest settlement came from DePuy, a Johnson & Johnson company. The\nimplant maker paid about $4 billion to settle 8,000 ASR hip claims in 2013.\n\n### Bayer Settles Essure Lawsuits\n\nIn August 2020, Bayer agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve about 90 percent\nof 39,000 Essure birth control claims. Bayer stopped selling the device in\nDecember 2018, but providers could still implant Essure up to one year from\nthe device\u2019s purchase date.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n****\n\n__Please seek the advice of a medical professional before making health care\ndecisions.\n\n**Share This Page:**\n\n  * _Share this page on Twitter_\n  * _Share this page on Facebook_\n  * _Copy Link_\n\nShare This Page: https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturers/ Copy Link\n\n  *  \n  *  \n  *  \n\nTELL US WHAT YOU THINK\n\n### Did You Find Drugwatch Helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n### Thank you for your feedback.
