I found information that was very helpful, that her\n> psychiatrist never told her.\"\n>\n> **Marianne Zahren** Patient\u2019s Family Member\n\n  *   * \n\nBig Pharma is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global\nrevenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1.42 trillion in 2021. But nowhere else\nin the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and\nmake as much money as in the U.S.\n\nSix of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in 2017 had their headquarters in\nthe U.S. These include Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead, Amgen and\nAbbVie.\n\nBut only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact,\nBig Pharma is the second most hated industry in America. It\u2019s right behind the\ntobacco industry and the oil, gas and chemical industry.\n\nBig Pharma is also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the\nFalse Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.\n\nThe industry has a history of fraud, bribery, lawsuits and scandals. Despite\ncriminal charges and fines, Big Pharma companies continue to do business.\n\n## What Is Big Pharma?\n\nBig Pharma is a term for the world\u2019s largest publicly traded pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\n\nThe biggest drug companies may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical\ndevices. Medical devices can be anything from syringes to hip and knee\nimplants.\n\nPrescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in\nbillions in profits.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are usually larger than companies that focus on\nmedical devices alone. Drug companies also tend to make more money.\n\n## Top Big Pharma Companies By Sales\n\nCompany| 2017 Total Revenue from Pharmaceutical Products (in billions) | 2017\nTotal Revenue (in billions)| Popular Prescription Products  \n---|---|---|---  \nPfizer (U.S.)| $52.5| $52.5| Eliquis, Nexium, Lipitor, Celebrex, Lyrica,\nEpiPen, Viagra, Xeljanz, Zoloft, Zithromax  \nRoche (Switzerland)| $44.4| $57.4| Actemra, Tamiflu, Valium  \nSanofi (France)| $36.7| $42.9| Zantac, Ambien, Dupixent, Lantus, Lemtrada,\nPlavix, Synvisc-One, Taxotere  \nJohnson & Johnson (U.S.)| $36.3| $76.5| Elmiron, Tylenol, Fentanyl, Haldol,\nRisperdal, Invokana, Invokamet, Levaquin, Lexapro, Remicade, Stelara, Topamax,\nXarelto  \nMerck & Co.

The U.S. makes about $148 billion,\naccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce. That\u2019s about half of the world\u2019s\nshare of the market.\n\n__ EXPAND\n\nAmericans spent $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. Drug prices\ncontinue to rise.\n\nAmericans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in\n2015. And drug prices continue to rise.\n\nConsulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices to rise 11.6 percent in\n2017. This estimate is for Americans under the age of 65.\n\nIn contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent. This means many\nAmericans won\u2019t be able to afford their medications.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Who Owns Big Pharma?\n\nWell, the better question is: Who does Big Pharma own?\n\nBig Pharma contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration. Big Pharma does this through application fees (user fees) for\nits new products.\n\nExperts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA\u2019s budget.\n\nBig Pharma also uses its profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists to spread\nits influence on Capitol Hill.\n\nBig Pharma Spending\n\nFor every $1 spent on \u201cbasic research,\u201d Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions\nand advertising.\n\nSource: BMJ\n\nFrom 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses \u2014\nmore than any other industry.\n\nIn 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million. That\u2019s more than the defense\nindustries and corporate business lobbyists combined.\n\nMedical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group. Medical Device\nManufacturers Association contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds in 2016.\n\nIts efforts concentrate on medical-device-friendly bills in Congress. They\nmostly relate to how companies pay taxes.\n\nCritics say Big Pharma relies on manipulative tactics to increase sales. They\nsay it uses expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, FDA and the public.\n\n## Notable Big Pharma Scandals\n\nThe long road to a Vioxx recall is arguably one of the most notable Big Pharma\nscandals in U.S. history.\n\nMerck announced a voluntary worldwide recall of its painkiller in 2004. It\ncame four years after evidence linked the drug to significant health risks.\n\nThe company\u2019s executives decided not to study Vioxx\u2019s cardiovascular risks.\nThe FDA later found the drug may cause an increased risk of heart attack and\nstroke.\n\nMerck paid the U.S. Department of Justice $950 million to resolve criminal\ncharges related to the marketing and sales of Vioxx.\n\nOne agency scientist, Dr. David Graham, estimated that the use of Vioxx may\nhave contributed to more than 27,000 heart attacks or deaths.\n\nBoth Merck and the FDA came under Congressional scrutiny.\n\nIn 2011, Merck pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the marketing and\nsales of Vioxx. The company agreed to pay the U.S. Department of Justice $950\nmillion to resolve its misconduct.\n\nMerck settled with tens of thousands of injured patients in 2007. Merck agreed\nto pay $4.85 billion to plaintiffs and their families.\n\n## Top Big Pharma Lawsuit Verdicts and Settlements\n\nIn a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements for marketing\nfraud. The settlements totaled $35.7 billion.\n\nPublic Citizen published this data in 2013. It called its report\nPharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.\n\nIn 2012, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) agreed to a $3 billion settlement. It was the\nlargest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history.\n\nThe charges stemmed from certain prescription drugs, including Paxil,\nWellbutrin and Avandia. GSK still ranks in the top ten for its pharmaceutical\ndrug profits.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is the world\u2019s largest health care company. It paid $2.2\nbillion in 2013 for improperly marketing its drug Risperdal.\n\n  * **Featured Article**\n\nSelling Side Effects: Big Pharma\u2019s Marketing Machine\n\nJuly 17, 2016\n\nBig Pharma companies were also hit with million- and billion-dollar verdicts.\nThese verdicts rarely impact the companies\u2019 profits.\n\nA jury ordered Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly to pay $9 billion in 2014.\nThe award went to an Actos user who developed bladder cancer.\n\nTakeda still reported an underlying revenue growth of 6.7 percent in 2017. Eli\nLilly saw sales of $22.87 billion the same year.\n\n**If you were seriously injured by a prescription drug or medical device, you\nmay be able to file a lawsuit.** Our Partners __\n\n### Our Trusted Legal Partners\n\nDrugwatch partners with trusted law firms to help you take legal action.

A St. Louis jury awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women, and this\nremains the largest single verdict so far.\n\nJohnson & Johnson announced it would stop selling its talcum powder products\nin the Unites States and Canada in May 2020.\n\n### Billions in Hip Implant Settlements\n\nCompanies have paid billions in hip implant lawsuit settlements to people who\nclaim they were injured by metal-on-metal hip implants.\n\nThe largest settlement came from DePuy, a Johnson & Johnson company. The\nimplant maker paid about $4 billion to settle 8,000 ASR hip claims in 2013.\n\n### Bayer Settles Essure Lawsuits\n\nIn August 2020, Bayer agreed to pay $1.6 billion to resolve about 90 percent\nof 39,000 Essure birth control claims. Bayer stopped selling the device in\nDecember 2018, but providers could still implant Essure up to one year from\nthe device\u2019s purchase date.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n****\n\n__Please seek the advice of a medical professional before making health care\ndecisions.\n\n**Share This Page:**\n\n  * _Share this page on Twitter_\n  * _Share this page on Facebook_\n  * _Copy Link_\n\nShare This Page: https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturers/ Copy Link\n\n  *  \n  *  \n  *  \n\nTELL US WHAT YOU THINK\n\n### Did You Find Drugwatch Helpful?\n\nYes No\n\n### Thank you for your feedback.

The company\u2019s highest selling drugs\nfor the year were Humalog (insulin) with $2.7 billion in sales, erectile\ndysfunction drug Cialis with $2.4 billion, and lung cancer drug Alimta with\n$2.2 billion in sales.\n\nFive of the company\u2019s best selling drugs, responsible for 21% of the company\u2019s\nrevenues, face patent expirations by 2023. These include Cialis, scheduled to\ngo off-patent in November 2017. Once these patents expire, the company expects\nlost revenue from competition with generic versions.\n\nDid You Know\n\nEli Lilly changed the way Americans perceived mental health care with the\nintroduction of Prozac.\n\nFounded by a Civil War veteran, the company would be at the forefront of 20th\ncentury medical innovations \u2013 becoming the first company to mass-produce\ninsulin, penicillin and the Salk Polio vaccine and changing the way Americans\nperceived mental health care with the introduction of Prozac.\n\nIt is the largest manufacturer of psychiatric medicines and one of the three\nlargest insulin manufacturers in the world.\n\nAs of 2017, more than one in five of Lilly\u2019s employees, and nearly a quarter\nof its revenues, were devoted to research and development of new treatments.\nLilly products were manufactured by plants in 13 countries and sold in 120\nnations around the world.\n\n## The Civil War and Science Shape Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Early History\n\nEli Lilly was only 16-years-old and a recent graduate of the class of 1854 at\nwhat is now DePauw University when he began a pharmacist apprenticeship in\nLafayette, Indiana. In 1861, the Civil War would interrupt his career, until\nthen spent working in various drugstores around the region. Joining the Union\nArmy, Lilly rose to the rank of colonel before he turned 27, leading artillery\nforces until he was taken prisoner by the Confederacy.\n\nWitnessing fellow officers die in an Alabama prisoner of war camp gave Lilly a\nfirsthand view of the ravages of 19th-century disease that he undoubtedly\ncarried with him for the rest of his life.\n\nThe original Eli Lilly & Co. building, opened in 1876\n\nAt a time when unreliable and often dangerous \u201ccure-all\u201d products were sold to\nan unsuspecting public, Lilly wanted to produce reliable, high-quality\nmedicines. He set out to create a line of medical products specifically for\nphysicians to use in treating their patients. He opened Eli Lilly and Company\nin an 18-by-40-foot, two-story building in Indianapolis on May 10, 1876.\n\nIn 1886, he hired full-time scientists chemist Ernest Eberhardt and botanist\nWalter Evans to research new products. His company would continue to devote a\nsizable portion of its operation to scientific research, spending more than $5\nbillion a year on research and development by 2016.\n\n## Insulin, Innovation Spur Lilly\u2019s 20th Century Growth\n\nEven though Lilly died in 1898, his Civil War experiences and focus on science\nin developing new drugs would continue to shape his company\u2019s culture through\nthe 20th century. Eli Lilly and Company would also become an innovator in new\nand breakthrough drug technology, allowing it to become one of the world\u2019s\nlargest pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nDid You Know\n\nLilly developed the first commercially produced insulin in 1923, which helped\nthem thrive during the great depression.\n\nIn 1923, when diabetes was nearly always fatal and had no adequate treatment,\nLilly worked with the University of Toronto to develop the first commercially\nproduced insulin, which the company branded as Iletin. Derived from animal\ninsulin, J.J.R. McLeod and Frederick Banting, the Scottish and Canadian\nresearchers who developed Iletin, received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology\nor Medicine for their work.\n\nTwo Lilly scientists, George Minot and William Murphy, working alongside\nWilliam Whipple of the University of Rochester, would win a Nobel Prize in\n1934 for their development of drugs during the 1920s to treat pernicious\nanemia, a blood and kidney disorder.\n\nAs the country weathered the Great Depression, Lilly kept its workers on the\njob and increased sales to $13 million in 1932. In 1934, it opened its first\ninternational subsidiary in the UK.\n\nDuring the First World War, Lilly had partnered with the American Red Cross to\ncreate the Lilly Field hospital, treating troops of all nationalities for two\nyears in France. During the Second World War, the company produced medicines\ncarried by American troops in flight and field kits. In early 1944, the\ncompany became the first to mass produce penicillin, leading Lilly into the\nfield of infectious disease prevention even as the antibiotic was rushed to\nallied battlefields in Europe and across the Pacific.\n\nBy 1950, the company had grown to more than 5,500 employees with sales\nreaching $159 million.\n\nIn 1955, Lilly became the first pharmaceutical company to manufacture and\ndistribute the Salk Polio Vaccine. The company expanded into cancer treatment\nin 1961, developing and marketing Velban (vinblastine), a chemotherapy drug\nused to treat several types of cancer. By the mid-1970s, Lilly topped $1\nbillion in sales for the first time, with 23,000 employees spread across 39\ninternational subsidiaries or divisions.\n\nEli Lilly & Co. headquarters in Indianapolis, IN\n\nIn 1982, the company released the diabetes drug Humulin. Lilly used\nrecombinant DNA technology for the first time to produce a medicine for\nhumans. Humulin is an insulin identical to that produced in the human body.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Lilly Redefines and Dominates Psychiatric Drug Market\n\nApproved in 1987, Prozac (fluoxetine HCl) may be Lilly\u2019s most famous drug. It\nwas also one of the company\u2019s most successful. The medicine to treat clinical\ndepression accounted for $2 billion in sales in 1994 \u2013 almost a third of the\ncompany\u2019s total revenue that year.\n\nThe antidepressant was the first in a class of drugs called selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). SSRIs target a single chemical in the\nbrain, serotonin. Prior to Prozac, antidepressants targeted several brain\nchemicals.\n\nProzac was not only a new way to treat major depression; the drug also became\na pop culture touchstone and helped Americans perceive mental health care in a\nmore positive light.\n\nLilly followed Prozac with Zyprexa (olanzapine) to treat schizophrenia in 1996\nand Cymbalta (duloxetine hydrochloride) to treat major depressive disorder in\n2004.\n\n## Eli Lilly and Co. Investigated, Named in Lawsuits for Insulin Price Hikes\n\nIn 2016, Humalog insulin was Lilly\u2019s biggest selling product and the company\nwas one of the world\u2019s three largest insulin producers. In 2017, the company\nannounced that it had responded to two investigations into possible insulin\nprice-fixing.\n\nIn an April 2017 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the\ncompany reported it had received \u201ccivil investigative demands\u201d \u2013 requests for\ndocuments and other evidence \u2013 from the attorneys general of Washington state\nand New Mexico who were investigating insulin price hikes. The company said\nthe Washington investigation sought information \u201crelating to the pricing of\nour insulin products and our relationships with pharmacy benefit managers.\u201d\n\nLilly said it was cooperating with both investigations.\n\nThe probes follow 15 years of rapidly rising insulin prices and increased\npublic, political and regulatory scrutiny on the cost of the medicine vital to\nkeep people with type 1 diabetes alive.\n\nFact\n\nA 2016 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that\ninsulin prices in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013.\n\nA 2016 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that\ninsulin prices in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013. By January\n2017, a month\u2019s supply of insulin could cost as much as $900. The American\nDiabetes Association reported that some patients were resorting to a risky\npractice of \u201crationing\u201d doses to make ends meet. Taking too small a dose,\nskipping doses or using expired insulin to save money can result in severe\nkidney damage or death for people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nNews investigations have documented Lilly and the other two largest insulin\nmanufacturers \u2013 Novo Nordisk and Sanofi \u2013 have raised insulin prices in near\nlockstep for years. Bloomberg, which first reported on the pattern, called it\n\u201cshadow pricing,\u201d meaning one company shadowing another\u2019s price increase by\nalmost the same amount. The difference is usually so small there is no\ncompetitive advantage for one product over the others.\n\nIn November 2016, two members of Congress, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and\nRep. Elijah Cummings, authored a letter to the U.S. Justice Department and\nFederal Trade Commission calling for investigations into the price hikes by\nthe three companies and others.\n\nIn March 2017, Lilly and the two other companies were named among the\ndefendants in a 69-count class action lawsuit in a New Jersey federal court.\nThe suit claims the manufacturers colluded with pharmacy benefit managers\n(PBMs) to fix insulin prices and violated federal antitrust laws. The three\nPBMs named in the suit \u2013 CVS Health, Express Scripts and OptumRx \u2013 control 80\npercent of the PBM industry, overseeing prescription coverage for 180 million\nAmericans.\n\nLilly reported in April 2017 that it was also named in at least two more\nsimilar class action lawsuits over insulin pricing. The company denied the\nallegations in all three lawsuits and promised to defend against them\n\u201cvigorously.\u201d\n\nJust two months later, in May 2017, Lilly raised the price of Humalog by 7.8\npercent to $274.70 for a 10 ml vial. Novo Nordisk followed suit raising the\nprice of its competing insulin 7.9 percent to $275.58 \u2013 a difference between\nthe two products\u2019 prices of just 88-cents.\n\nIn its April 2017 SEC filing, Lilly said revenue for Humalog had increased 24\npercent to $449.1 million in the U.S. in the first three months of 2017.\nWorldwide, Humalog sales rose 17 percent to $708 million.\n\nIn May 2023, the class-action lawsuit against Lilly ended in the company\nagreeing to pay the plaintiffs $13.5 million. According to court documents\nfiled on May 26 in New Jersey, Lilly also agreed to a cap on out-of-pocket\ncosts for its insulin at $35 per month for four years.\n\n  * ****\n\nEli Lilly Reaches $13.5 Million Settlement in Insulin Pricing Lawsuit\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\n## Problematic Medications Prove Costly for Eli Lilly and Company\n\nLilly has also faced financial setbacks and regulatory scrutiny over several\nhigh-profile medications in recent years. Lawsuits, settlements and even a\nrecord criminal fine have affected the company\u2019s finances.\n\nIn 2000, the FDA approved Lilly\u2019s Zyprexa (olanzapine) for treatment of\npsychotic disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Zyprexa\nworks by binding receptors in the brain, reducing delusions and\nhallucinations.\n\nMore than 26,000 lawsuits were filed by people who claimed they developed\ndiabetes or related conditions after taking Zyprexa\n\nStudies later linked the drug to weight gain and increased blood sugar levels,\nand by 2007, Lilly had paid $1.2 billion to settle more than 26,000 lawsuits\nfiled by people who claimed in court documents they developed diabetes or\nrelated conditions after taking Zyprexa.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also brought criminal and civil charges\nagainst Lilly after the company promoted Zyprexa for treatments the FDA had\nnot approved. These included the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease.\n\nIn 2009, Lilly pleaded guilty to the federal charges against the company. It\nagreed to pay more than $1.4 billion to resolve the case. This included an\n$800-million civil settlement with the DOJ and a criminal fine of $515 million\n\u2013 the largest ever in a health care case at the time.\n\nThe company is believed to be shielded from liability in a joint venture with\nJapanese drug maker Takeda that resulted in another multi-billion dollar court\nsettlement. In 1999, the FDA approved Actos (pioglitazone) to treat type 2\ndiabetes in the U.S. Developed by Takeda and marketed in the U.S. by Eli Lilly\nuntil 2006, Actos became one of the best-selling drugs in the world for a\nshort time. But studies and reports of serious side effects prompted the FDA\nto conclude that it could increase the risk of bladder cancer in people who\ntook it.\n\nTakeda agreed to settle more than 10,000 Actos lawsuits for $2.4 billion in\n2015. Lilly said in its 2016 annual report that its business agreement with\nTakeda required the Japanese company to \u201cdefend and indemnify us against our\nlosses and expenses\u201d in the U.S. lawsuits.\n\nThe drug Cymbalta (duloxetine) also led to lawsuits when people taking it\ndeveloped medical complications when they stopped taking it. Withdrawal\nsymptoms could sometimes be life-threatening. These included extreme mood\nswings and physical or neurological problems.\n\nIn 2009, the FDA termed the withdrawal symptoms \u201cCymbalta discontinuation\nsyndrome\u201d in a review of the drug. The agency said it was \u201cmore severe and\nmuch more widespread than acknowledged\u201d by the company.\n\nThe FDA also found Lilly had not adequately warned people about just how\nserious these symptoms could be. The agency required Lilly to take several\nsteps to improve warnings, including setting up a system to collect complaints\nabout the drug.\n\nIn 2016, Lilly said it had established a settlement framework to settle the\nnearly 140 lawsuits still pending in various U.S. courts over injuries from\nCymbalta.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Eli Lilly & Co.
