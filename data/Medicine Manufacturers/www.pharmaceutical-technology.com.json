Johnson & Johnson \u2013 $56.1bn**\n\nJohnson & Johnson is currently involved in development of a vaccine to fight\nthe COVID-19 disease. Image courtesy of Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s (J&J) consumer health segment recorded a 0.3% increase in\nrevenues, majorly contributed by sales in the US market along with\nacquisitions and divestitures, which had a positive impact of 1.6% on sales\ngrowth.\n\nRevenues of the pharmaceutical division grew by 3.6%, driven by the immunology\n($13.95bn) and oncology ($10.69bn) portfolio. Some of the new prescription\ndrugs approved during the year included BALVERSA\u2122 (erdafitinib), XARELTO\u00ae\n(rivaroxaban), SPRAVATO\u00ae (esketamine), INVOKANA\u00ae (canagliflozin) and STELARA\u00ae\n(ustekinumab).\n\nJ&J expects minor disruption to its pharmaceutical business in 2020 although\ngrowth is projected to remain above market growth. The majority of the\ncategories of the consumer health segment are anticipated to perform well,\nalthough certain categories may be impacted due to reduced store visits and\nsocial distancing behaviours.\n\nJ&J is working towards the development of a COVID-19 vaccine through the Ad26\u00ae\nvector technology and PER.C6\u00ae manufacturing platform.\n\nThe vaccine candidate was announced in March 2020 and entered pre-\nmanufacturing in June 2020. Clinical trials were commenced in September 2020\nwith data expected to be available in December 2020. Based on the results, the\nfirst batches of the vaccine are expected to be available in the first quarter\nof 2021 for emergency use.\n\n## **2\\. Pfizer \u2013 $51.75bn**\n\nThe US contributed to 46% of Pfizer\u2019s sales in 2019. Image courtesy of Michael\nVi/Shutterstock.\n\nPfizer recorded a 4% decline in revenues with the biopharma segment accounting\nfor 76.2% of the revenues. International markets contributed to 54% of the\ncompany\u2019s revenues that were driven by the sales of anti-infective products in\nChina, including its antibiotic drug Sulperazon. The US accounted for the\nremaining 46% of the sales, which were affected due to the generic competition\nto anti-seizure drug Lyrica.\n\nThe company formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to combine their\nconsumer healthcare businesses. Pfizer owns a 32% equity interest in the joint\nventure while GSK owns the remainder.\n\nThe Upjohn business segment was announced to be combined with Mylan to form a\nnew pharmaceutical company named Viatris. Pfizer acquired Array BioPharma and\nTherachon Holding for $11.2bn and $340m, respectively, in addition to\nAstraZeneca\u2019s small molecule anti-infectives for $1bn. The company also\nacquired the licence for Akcea Therapeutics\u2019 investigational antisense therapy\nANGPTL3-LRx.\n\nPfizer\u2019s sales were impacted in the first quarter of 2020 due to the lockdown\nrestrictions and a decline in patient visits. The company plans to increase\ninvestment in research and development by $500m towards the development of\nanti-infective products and a COVID-19 vaccine named BNT162 mRNA. Phase 2b/3\ntrials on the vaccine began in July 2020 while regulatory approval is expected\nin the fourth quarter of 2020, based on the results.\n\n## **3\\.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.\n\nRevenues of Roche\u2019s pharmaceutical division increased by 11% year-on-year,\ndriven by sales of new medicines, including Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Tecentriq, and\nPerjeta. Tecentriq in the oncology segment and Actemra/RoActemra and Esbriet\nin immunology also contributed significantly to the company\u2019s revenues despite\nthe negative performance of the biosimilars business in Europe and Japan.\n\nCompetition from biosimilars particularly of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and\nAvastin in the US impacted sales by $1.55bn. The company reported a 36% growth\nin China due to broader market penetration, although the US remained the\nbiggest contributor to its sales, followed by Europe and Japan. A key\ntransaction for the pharmaceutical division during the year was the\nacquisition of Spark Therapeutics for $4.8bn.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a positive impact on Roche\u2019s sales.\nThe company\u2019s oncology drugs Actemra/RoActemra are being investigated in\nclinical phase three trials to determine their safety and efficacy in treating\nsevere COVID-19 pneumonia. Production capacity of the drugs is planned to be\nincreased based on the results.\n\n## **4\\. Novartis \u2013 $47.45bn**\n\nNovartis partnered with several organisations for COVID-19 research and\ndevelopment activities. Image courtesy of Novartis AG.\n\nNovartis recorded a 6% year-on-year growth in 2019 revenues, with the\ninnovative medicines division contributing 79% of the revenues and Sandoz\naccounting for the remaining 21%. Majority of the company\u2019s revenues were\ncontributed by established markets, including the US, Canada, Western Europe,\nJapan, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nKey transactions completed in 2019 included the spin-off of the Alcon segment\ninto a separate business, acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global\nIncorporated, and merger with The Medicines Company. Novartis also acquired\nXiidra dry eye medication from Takeda.\n\nKey drugs approved in 2019 were Zolgensma for the treatment of spinal muscular\natrophy in paediatric patients aged less than two years, Beovu for the\ntreatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, and Adakveo\nto reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell\ndisease aged 16 years and older.\n\nNovartis expects manageable disruption to its operations due to the COVID-19\npandemic. The company has formed collaborations with a number of research\norganisations to develop a treatment for the coronavirus disease. It has\ninitiated a phase three clinical trial for testing the efficacy of its\nmyelofibrosis drug ruxolitinib in treating pneumonia in COVID-19 patients,\nalong with a phase three trial of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination\nwith azithromycin for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.\n\n## **5\\. Merck & Co. \u2013 $46.84bn**\n\nMerck\u2019s revenues in 2019 were primarily driven by oncology, human health\nvaccines and animal health divisions. Image courtesy of Merck Sharp & Dohme\nCorp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A.\n\nMerck & Co. reported an 11% year-on-year increase in revenues driven by\noncology, human health vaccines, and animal health divisions. International\nsales, led by China, contributed a moderately higher percentage to the\ncompany\u2019s revenues. Sales in China grew by 47%, driven by Keytruda and\nGardasil/Gardasil 9.\n\nIn 2019, Merck received approval for ERVEBO\u00ae (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) for\nthe prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals aged 18\nyears and older. RECARBRIO\u2122 for complicated urinary tract infections and\nZERBAXA\u00ae for the treatment of pneumonia were other drugs approved in the year.\nThe company also received approval for several indications for its oncology\ndrug Keytruda as monotherapy, as well as combination therapy for the treatment\nof various forms of cancer. The multiple approvals led to higher demand for\nthe drug with global sales growing by 55%.\n\nMerck completed the acquisition of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies,\nincluding Peloton Therapeutics, Immune Design, and ArQule to strengthen its\noncology portfolio. It also acquired Antelliq Group to strengthen its animal\nhealth business. Merck expects a revenue impact of $2.1bn in 2020 due to the\nunfavourable conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. It started\nrecruitment for trails on its experimental COVID-19 vaccine candidate in\nSeptember 2020. It has also collaborated with the Institute for Systems\nBiology and is part of the NIH-led Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic\nInterventions and Vaccines (ACTIV consortium) to develop vaccine and drug\ncandidates against the disease.\n\n## **6\\. GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 $44.27bn**\n\nGSK merged its consumer healthcare unit with that of Pfizer in August 2019.\nImage courtesy of GlaxoSmithKline plc.\n\nGSK\u2019s 10% year-on-year growth in 2019 revenues was driven by increased sales\nof its pharmaceuticals and vaccines products particularly Shingrix, a shingles\nvaccine, respiratory drugs Trelegy and Nucala, and HIV drugs Dovato and\nJuluca.\n\nThe pharmaceuticals and vaccines divisions together accounted for 73.3% of the\ncompany\u2019s revenues while the consumer health division accounted for the\nremaining 26.7%. The US region accounted for the majority of the company\u2019s\nrevenues at 41.1%, while Europe and international markets accounted for the\nrest.\n\nGSK acquired Tesaro, an oncology company, and granted a technology license to\nSabin Vaccine Institute for its clinical-stage Ebola vaccines in 2019.\n\nGSK is yet to ascertain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic although it\nexpects certain internal and external risks to business performance in 2020.\nThe company has collaborated with Sanofi to develop an adjuvanted vaccine\ncandidate for COVID-19 and Vir Biotechnology to identify new anti-viral\nantibodies against the disease. GSK is also collaborating with the University\nof Queensland, Xiamen Innovax Biotech, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, and\nChongqing Zhifei.\n\n## **7\\. Sanofi \u2013 $40.46bn**\n\nFDA awarded Breakthrough Therapy designation for Sanofi\u2019s Dupixent\u00ae for\neosinophilic esophagitis in September 2020.
