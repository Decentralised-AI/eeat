| Company | Pricing Plan | Business Model |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| EMpr.com | Repatha: $5,850 per year | Subscription and Advertising |
| Access to Medicine Foundation | Generic and biosimilar medicine manufacturers | Provide large quantities of medicines, and sell them at lower prices and smaller profit margins than originator companies.
