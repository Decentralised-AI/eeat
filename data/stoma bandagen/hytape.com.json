Proper bandaging and taping of\nbandages can help patients avoid skin irritation and other health issues.\nHowever, skin irritation is a common issue that most patients will deal with\nat some point.\n\nSkin irritations, allergic reactions, and other health problems can occur at\nthe stoma site. With the right care, patients can alleviate the irritation,\nslow health issues, and keep their stoma clean. Below, we\u2019ll discuss a variety\nof common issues ostomy patients may deal with and how to resolve these\nproblems.\n\n##  **Treating itchy skin at the stoma**\n\nItchy skin is a common problem that ostomy patients run into when caring for\ntheir stoma. With bandaging and adhesive tape regularly near the opening and\nbandage changes being common, itchy skin can be expected.\n\nTwo common causes of itchy skin at the stoma include allergic dermatitis and\ncontact dermatitis. Allergic dermatitis occurs when the skin has an allergic\nreaction due to bandaging, tape, soap, or another substance that may contact\nthe stoma region. Contact dermatitis occurs when the skin near the stoma is\nirritated by contact with tape or bandaging scraping off the outermost layer\nof skin.\n\nProper taping of a stoma opening can help greatly reduce the chances of\nallergic and contact dermatitis. Hy-Tape, for example, features no allergens\nthat could cause an allergic reaction. It also holds well without irritating\nthe skin when peeled off. This allows the bandage to be held safely in place\nwithout worry of the skin becoming irritated due to allergens or tough peeling\nof the tape.  \n  \nLearn More \u2013 Management Strategies for New Ostomies\n\n##  **Treating red or blistering skin**\n\nRed, blistering skin can be a serious annoyance for those with a stoma. It can\nmake it difficult to keep the area bandaged properly and puts patients at risk\nof infection and serious health problems.\n\nRed or blistering skin near the stoma site can be due to mechanical\nirritation. This is a common issue that develops when bandaging is changed. As\nthe bandage tape is removed, it can take a thin layer of skin with it. If the\ntape is removed quickly, it can greatly affect the area.\n\nPatients dealing with mechanical irritation should carefully wash the\nirritated area with skin-sensitive soap and water. Patting the area dry will\nallow for less irritation than rubbing it dry. Using Hy-Tape to hold the new\nbandage in place will also be helpful, as the tape is skin sensitive and\nfeatures zinc oxide to help protect the skin during tape changes.\n\nFungal infections are another cause of red or blistering skin. These can occur\nwhen a fungus begins to develop at the stoma site, commonly due to water or\nbacteria entering through the tape and bandage. Antifungal stoma powders can\nkill the fungus. To avoid fungal issues, Hy-Tape provides a waterproof seal to\nkeep foreign debris away from the stoma.\n\n##  **Treating small red bumps at the stoma**\n\nRed bumps near the stoma are another common ailment ostomy patients often\nexperience. These can arise due to issues with the hair that is present near\nthe stoma.\n\nFolliculitis is a common skin irritation where hair follicles are damaged by\nadhesive tape. When bandage tape is removed from the skin, it tugs at the hair\nand follicles, sometimes pulling the hair out and irritating the skin. This\ncan lead to itchiness and small red bumps for the patient.\n\nIt\u2019s best to shave the stoma area carefully with an electric razor or clip the\nhair with scissors. Shaving with a razor and shaving cream is another\npossibility but it must be done extremely carefully near a stoma. Washing the\narea with antibacterial soap and patting it dry will also help. With little to\nno hair at the opening, folliculitis is much less likely to occur.\n\nUsing Hy-Tape to secure the bandage is especially helpful, as the tape is\ndesigned to move comfortably with the patient. It\u2019s also designed to peel away\neasily without irritating the skin.\n\n##  **How Hy-Tape can assist in avoiding skin irritation**\n\nHy-Tape is formulated with a variety of features that help ostomy patients\nprotect their stoma and avoid skin irritation. The tape is made with zinc\noxide, is flexible, holds tightly, is waterproof, and peels away easily.\n\nHy-Tape\u2019s zinc oxide formula protects the underlying skin. The flexibility of\nthe tape itself makes it easy for patients to freely maneuver without pinching\nor cutting. The tape holds tightly due to its high-grade adhesive. It\u2019s also\nwaterproof, keeping water, dirt, and debris away from the stoma opening. Hy-\nTape also peels away easily when it\u2019s time for bandage chances to avoid\npeeling away the outer layer of skin.\n\nFor ostomy patients who deal with skin irritation at their stoma site, Hy-Tape\nis a high-quality choice for protecting the stoma without causing skin\nirritation.
