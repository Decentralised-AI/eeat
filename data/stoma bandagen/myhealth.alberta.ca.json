But\nyou may get tired quickly at first. Your belly may be sore, and you will\nprobably need pain medicine for a week or two. Your stoma will be swollen at\nfirst. This is normal.\n\nYou may have very loose stools in your colostomy bag for a while. In time your\nstools may become firmer, but they will be less solid than before your\nsurgery. You may also have a lot of gas pass into your colostomy bag in the\nweeks after surgery. This will decrease as you heal.\n\nHow quickly you get better depends, in part, on whether you had a laparoscopic\nor open surgery. But you will probably need at least 6 weeks to get back to\nyour normal routine.\n\nThis care sheet gives you a general idea about how long it will take for you\nto recover. But each person recovers at a different pace. Follow the steps\nbelow to get better as quickly as possible.\n\n## How can you care for yourself at home?\n\n### Activity\n\n  * Rest when you feel tired. Getting enough sleep will help you recover.\n  * Try to walk each day. Start by walking a little more than you did the day before. Bit by bit, increase the amount you walk. Walking boosts blood flow and helps prevent pneumonia.\n  * Avoid strenuous activities, such as biking, jogging, weight lifting, or aerobic exercise, until your doctor says it is okay.\n  * For at least 6 weeks, avoid lifting anything that would make you strain. This may include heavy grocery bags and milk containers, a heavy briefcase or backpack, cat litter or dog food bags, a vacuum cleaner, or a child.\n  * Ask your doctor when you can drive again.\n  * You will probably need to take 6 weeks off from work. It depends on the type of work you do and how you feel.\n  * You can take a bath or shower as usual. You can bathe with your colostomy bag on or off.\n  * Ask your doctor when it is okay for you to have sex.\n\n### Diet\n\n  * You may need to follow a low-fibre diet for the first few weeks after your surgery.\n  * Drink plenty of fluids (unless your doctor tells you not to).\n\n### Medicines\n\n  * Your doctor will tell you if and when you can restart your medicines. He or she will also give you instructions about taking any new medicines.\n  * If you stopped taking aspirin or some other blood thinner, your doctor will tell you when to start taking it again. \n  * Take pain medicines exactly as directed. \n    * If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it as prescribed.\n    * If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.\n  * If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.\n  * If you think your pain medicine is making you sick to your stomach: \n    * Take your medicine after meals (unless your doctor has told you not to).\n    * Ask your doctor for a different pain medicine.\n\n### Incision care\n\n  * If you have strips of tape on the cut (incision) the doctor made, leave the tape on for a week or until it falls off. Or follow your doctor's instructions for removing the tape.\n  * Wash the area daily with warm, soapy water, and pat it dry. Don't use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, which can slow healing. You may cover the area with a gauze bandage if it weeps or rubs against clothing. Change the bandage every day.\n  * Keep the area clean and dry.\n\n### Other instructions\n\n  * Keep the area around your stoma clean and dry.\n  * Follow all instructions from your doctor or ostomy nurse.\n  * Empty and replace your colostomy bag as often as directed by your doctor or ostomy nurse.\n\n **Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety.** Be sure to\nmake and go to all appointments, and call your doctor or nurse advice line (\n**811** in most provinces and territories) if you are having problems. It's\nalso a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines\nyou take.\n\n## When should you call for help?\n\n **Call 911 ** anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example,\ncall if:\n\n  * You passed out (lost consciousness).\n  * You are short of breath.\n\n **Call your doctor or nurse advice line now** or seek immediate medical care\nif:\n\n  * You have pain that does not get better after you take your pain medicine.\n  * You have signs of infection, such as: \n    * Increased pain, swelling, warmth, or redness.\n    * Red streaks leading from the stoma.\n    * Pus draining from the stoma.\n    * A fever.\n  * You are sick to your stomach or cannot drink fluids.\n  * You cannot pass stools or gas.\n  * Bright red blood has soaked through the bandage over your incision.\n  * You have loose stitches, or your incision comes open.\n  * You have signs of a blood clot in your leg (called a deep vein thrombosis), such as: \n    * Pain in your calf, back of knee, thigh, or groin.\n    * Redness and swelling in your leg or groin.\n  * You have a problem with your stoma.\n\nWatch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor\nor nurse advice line if you have any problems.\n\nFor 24/7 nurse advice and general health information call Health Link at 811.\n\n  \n\n## Where can you learn more?\n\nGo to https://www.healthwise.net/patientEd\n\nEnter W996 in the search box to learn more about **\"Colostomy: What to Expect\nat Home\".**\n\nCurrent as of: November 30, 2022\n\nAuthor: Healthwise Staff\n\nMedical Review:Adam Husney MD - Family Medicine & Kenneth Bark MD - General\nSurgery, Colon and Rectal Surgery\n\n### Topic Contents\n\n  * Your Recovery\n  * How can you care for yourself at home?\n  * When should you call for help?\n\nCare instructions adapted under license by your healthcare professional.

You'll be surprised by\nhow spending just a little extra time can save you money. And the more time\nyou spend\u2014in planning, shopping, and cooking\u2014the more money you'll save.\n\n### Save money by learning and planning:\n\n  * Plan and shop for a week's worth of meals at a time. You're less likely to go out to eat or buy expensive convenience foods during the week when the ingredients for dinner are already in your kitchen.\n  * Keep a list of what leftovers are in your refrigerator and freezer. That way they won't go to waste because you forgot they were there. And you can use the list when you're planning next week's meals.\n  * Watch grocery store ads for sales so that you can stock up on items you know you will use. You can sometimes save money by buying more of something. For example, some stores may give you a discount if you buy 12 cans of chicken broth instead of just 2 or 3.\n  * Learn how much food costs. That way you can tell when an advertised sale is really a good deal.\n  * Use coupons. People who invest time in saving and organizing coupons often save a lot of money.\n  * Learn how to grow your own vegetables. If you don't have the space, see if there is a community garden in your neighbourhood. Or try growing a few vegetables or herbs on your porch or in a sunny indoor room.\n  * See how many convenience foods you can cross off your list by planning something healthier and cheaper instead. For example: \n    * Instead of potato chips, buy unpopped popcorn you can make at home.\n    * Instead of ready-made desserts, make your own cookies, cakes, or muffins.\n    * Instead of packaged snacks, buy crackers and peanut butter to make your own little sandwich snacks. Or snack on fresh or dried fruits.\n    * Instead of sweetened cold cereals, buy oatmeal or other hot cereal.\n\n### Save money at the grocery store:\n\n  * Always shop with a list. Try not to buy anything that's not on your list, but be open to unexpected sale items that you know you will use.\n  * Shopping with family members can cost you money if they talk you into buying things that aren't on your list. Shop by yourself if you have to.\n  * Buy fresh fruits and vegetables when they're in season. They are likely to be fresher and cost less.\n  * Buy frozen vegetables. They are picked at the peak of ripeness and have just as many\u2014or more\u2014vitamins and minerals as fresh. And they cost less.\n  * Buy store brands instead of name brands.\n  * Shop in the bulk foods aisle, where things like beans, rice, pasta, and other dried foods may be cheaper.\n\n### Save money elsewhere:\n\n  * Whole-grain bread is healthier than regular bread, but it usually costs more. If you have a bakery outlet in your community, you can buy day-old whole-grain bread there at a discount.\n  * Check out fresh produce at a farmer's market or a produce stand. Prices are sometimes lower there than at the grocery store.\n  * Many fruit orchards let customers pick the fruit themselves to save money.\n\n### Save money in your kitchen:\n\n  * Build up your cooking skills. Buy one good, general cookbook. Used bookstores are a good source.\n  * Invest in a slow cooker or Crock-Pot. With a slow cooker you can buy less expensive cuts of meat, because the long, slow cooking time makes them tender and very tasty. Plus, the dish cooks all day while you're at work or busy with something else.\n  * Learn how to cut up a chicken. You can save money by buying whole chickens and cutting them apart yourself. And make soup with the bones.\n  * Make vegetables your main dish, and serve your meat as a smaller side dish. You'll save money by eating less meat. You can also serve beans instead of meat.\n  * Make your own lunch, and take it with you to work.\n  * Use recipes you can double or triple, so you can freeze leftovers for later. \n  * When a recipe calls for milk, use skim milk powder. You just add the milk powder to water to make only as much as you need.\n\n## Related Information\n\n  * Healthy Eating\n\n## Credits\n\nCurrent as of:  March 1, 2023\n\nAuthor: Healthwise Staff  \nMedical Review:  \nAdam Husney MD - Family Medicine  \nMartin J.
