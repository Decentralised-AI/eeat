They are comfortable and most\nimportantly keep my stoma supported helping to prevent prolapse and hernia. I\ndon't tuck my pouch in between the 2 layers but rather wear both layers over\nthe pouch - for my purposes the wrap seems more sturdy and protective this\nway. I greatly recommend this product!\"\n\nDouble Layer Stoma Wrap 10\" Level 2 Medium Support - Unisex\n\n  * Sign in with Apple user\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\"The wrap is excellent quality, exactly as described, and fits beautifully.\nI\u2019m only 60 days from surgery, and it\u2019s the first product that allows me to\nactually forget my stoma and get back to work (office job). I have the pocket\nversion and cannot recommend it enough\u2014just ordered a second so I can rotate\nthe two. Just don\u2019t forget to empty your bag: it\u2019s that comfortable!\"\n\nComfort Plus Ostomy Belt - Black\n\n  * Amy\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\"I love this item.

NOT\nwaterproof but great protection for stoma pouch.\"\n\nOstomy Belt, Adjustable Colostomy Belt Wrap, Premium Stoma Belt Ostomy Bag\nCover, Ileostomy Garments for Sport & Swimming, SIIL Ostomy Gift\n\n  * Paul Davis\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\n\"One of the best priced stoma guards out there. Also, very solid and\nfunctional. My lack of 5 stars stems from the fact (like all others that I\nhave tried) the device adheres to the bag or belt that supports the ostomy\nappliance. This creates a lack of uniform protection when wearing a belt with\nyour \"bottoms\". I would like to see this device adapted so that it clips to\nthe belt and removes the Velcro so that it can slide up and down with the\npants as one sits/stands. This would also mean that the top curved closure of\nthe device be removed/revisited so that there is no scraping of the stoma as\nthe device moves up and down.\"\n\nStoma Protector\n\n## Common Questions\n\nDoes Etsy offer free shipping?\n\nShipping policies vary, but many of our sellers offer free shipping when you\npurchase from them.
