It will also help you understand what to\nexpect during your recovery.\n\nUse this guide as a source of information in the days leading up to your\nsurgery. Bring it with you every time you come to MSK, including the day of\nyour surgery. You and your healthcare team will refer to it throughout your\ncare.\n\nBack to top\n\n## About Your Surgery\n\n### About your ileostomy\n\nAn ileostomy is the opening your surgeon made in your abdomen (belly) when you\nhad surgery to remove a part of your colon or rectum. Your ileostomy was\ncreated from the part of your small intestine called the ileum. This allowed\nyour bowel movements (poop) to pass out of your body and into a stoma bag.\nYour ileostomy was made so your anastomosis (the place where your surgeon\nreconnected your bowel) can heal.\n\n### About your ileostomy closure surgery\n\nAn ileostomy closure surgery is done to reverse your ileostomy so you can have\nbowel movements like you did before your surgery. Ileostomy closure surgery is\nusually done through your stoma (see Figure 1). Your surgeon may need to make\nan additional incision (surgical cut), but this is rare.\n\nFigure 1. Your stoma\n\nAfter your surgery, you\u2019ll have a small wound where your ileostomy used to be.\nThis wound will heal in about 4 to 6 weeks. You\u2019ll need to change the bandage\non this wound every day. While you\u2019re in the hospital, your nurse will teach\nyou how to change your bandage and give you the supplies you\u2019ll need to do it\nat home.\n\nBack to top\n\n## Getting ready for your surgery\n\nThis section will help you get ready for your surgery. Read it when your\nsurgery is scheduled. Refer to it as your surgery gets closer. It has\nimportant information about what to do to get ready.\n\nAs you read this section, write down questions to ask your healthcare\nprovider.\n\n### Getting ready for your surgery\n\nYou and your care team will work together to get ready for your surgery. Help\nus keep you safe by telling us if any of these things apply to you, even if\nyou\u2019re not sure.\n\n  * I take an anticoagulant (blood thinner), such as:\n\nThese are examples of medicines. There are others.  \n  \nBe sure your healthcare provider knows all the medicines you\u2019re taking.\n\n    * Aspirin\n    * Heparin\n    * Warfarin (Jantoven\u00ae, Coumadin\u00ae)\n    * Clopidogrel (Plavix\u00ae)\n    * Enoxaparin (Lovenox\u00ae)\n    * Dabigatran (Pradaxa\u00ae)\n    * Apixaban (Eliquis\u00ae)\n    * Rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae)\n  * I take an SGLT2 inhibitor, such as:\n    * Canagliflozin (Invokana\u00ae)\n    * Dapagliflozin (Farxiga\u00ae)\n    * Empagliflozin (Jardiance\u00ae)\n    * Ertugliflozin (Steglatro\u00ae)\n  * I take prescription medicine(s), including patches and creams. A prescription medicine is one you can only get with a prescription from your healthcare provider. \n  * I take over-the-counter medicine(s), including patches and creams. An over-the-counter medicine is one you can buy without a prescription. \n  * I take dietary supplements, such as herbs, vitamins, minerals, or natural or home remedies. \n  * I have a pacemaker, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), or other heart device. \n  * I have sleep apnea. \n  * I have had a problem with anesthesia (A-nes-THEE-zhuh) in the past. Anesthesia is medicine to make you sleep during a surgery or procedure. \n  * I\u2019m allergic to certain medicines or materials, including latex. \n  * I\u2019m not willing to receive a blood transfusion. \n  * I drink alcohol. \n  * I smoke or use an electronic smoking device, such as a vape pen or e-cigarette. \n  * I use recreational drugs, such as marijuana. \n\n#### About drinking alcohol\n\nIt\u2019s important to talk with your healthcare providers about how much alcohol\nyou drink. This will help us plan your care.\n\nIf you drink alcohol regularly, you may be at risk for problems during and\nafter your surgery. These include bleeding, infections, heart problems, and a\nlonger hospital stay.\n\nIf you drink alcohol regularly and stop suddenly, it can cause seizures,\ndelirium, and death. If we know you\u2019re at risk for these problems, we can\nprescribe medicine to help prevent them.\n\nHere are things you can do before your surgery to keep from having problems.\n\n  * Be honest with your healthcare providers about how much alcohol you drink. \n  * Try to stop drinking alcohol once your surgery is planned. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you:\n    * Get a headache.\n    * Feel nauseous (like you\u2019re going to throw up).\n    * Feel more anxious (nervous or worried) than usual.\n    * Cannot sleep.\n\nThese are early signs of alcohol withdrawal and can be treated.\n\n  * Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot stop drinking. \n  * Ask your healthcare provider questions about drinking and surgery. All your medical information will be kept private, as always. \n\n#### About smoking\n\nIf you smoke, you can have breathing problems when you have surgery. Stopping\nfor even a few days before your surgery can help.\n\nYour healthcare provider will refer you to our Tobacco Treatment Program if\nyou smoke. You can also reach the program by calling 212-610-0507.\n\n#### About sleep apnea\n\nSleep apnea is a common breathing problem. If you have sleep apnea, you stop\nbreathing for short lengths of time while you\u2019re asleep. The most common type\nis obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). With OSA, your airway becomes fully blocked\nduring sleep.\n\nOSA can cause serious problems during and after surgery. Tell us if you have\nor think you might have sleep apnea. If you use a breathing device, such as a\nCPAP machine, bring it on the day of your surgery.\n\n#### Using MyMSK\n\nMyMSK (my.mskcc.org) is your MSK patient portal. You can use it to send and\nread messages from your care team, view your test results, see your\nappointment dates and times, and more. You can also invite your caregiver to\nmake their own account so they can see information about your care.\n\nIf you do not have a MyMSK account, you can sign up at my.mskcc.org. You can\nget an enrollment ID by calling 646-227-2593 or your doctor\u2019s office.\n\nWatch How to Enroll in MyMSK: Memorial Sloan Kettering's Patient Portal to\nlearn more. You can also contact the MyMSK Help Desk by emailing\nmymsk@mskcc.org or calling 800-248-0593.\n\n##### About your MyMSK Goals to Discharge Checklist\n\nAfter your surgery, you\u2019ll focus on getting well enough to leave the hospital.\nWe\u2019ll send a Goals to Discharge Checklist to your MyMSK account to help you\ntrack how you\u2019re doing.\n\nYou can use your MyMSK Goals to Discharge Checklist to see the goals you need\nto meet before leaving the hospital. You can also update your progress\nthroughout the day. Your updates send alerts to your surgical team about your\nprogress.\n\nTo learn more, read Frequently Asked Questions About the MyMSK Goals to\nDischarge Checklist.\n\n#### About Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)\n\nERAS is a program to help you get better faster after your surgery. It\u2019s\nimportant to do certain things before and after your surgery as part of the\nERAS program.\n\nBefore your surgery, make sure you\u2019re ready by:\n\n  * **Reading this guide.** It will help you know what to expect before, during, and after your surgery. If you have questions, write them down. You can ask your healthcare provider at your next visit or call their office. \n  * **Exercising and following a healthy diet.** This will help get your body ready for your surgery. \n\nAfter your surgery, help yourself recover more quickly by:\n\n  * **Reading your recovery pathway.** This is an educational resource your healthcare provider will give you. It has goals for your recovery. It will help you know what to do and expect each day. \n  * **Starting to move around as soon as you can.** The sooner you get out of bed and walk, the quicker you can get back to your usual activities. \n\n### Within 30 days of your surgery\n\n#### Presurgical testing (PST)\n\nYou\u2019ll have a PST appointment before your surgery. You\u2019ll get a reminder from\nyour surgeon\u2019s office with the appointment date, time, and location.\n\nYou can eat and take your usual medicine(s) the day of your PST appointment.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to bring these things to your appointment:\n\n  * A list of all the medicines you\u2019re taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, patches, and creams. \n  * Results of any medical tests done outside of MSK in the past year, if you have them. Examples include results from a cardiac stress test, echocardiogram, or carotid doppler study. \n  * The names and telephone numbers of your healthcare providers. \n\nYou\u2019ll meet with an advance practice provider (APP) during your PST\nappointment. They work closely with MSK\u2019s anesthesiology (A-nes-THEE-zee-AH-\nloh-jee) staff. These are healthcare providers with special training in using\nanesthesia during a surgery or procedure.\n\nYour APP will review your medical and surgical history with you. You may have\ntests to plan your care, such as:\n\n  * An electrocardiogram (EKG) to check your heart rhythm. \n  * A chest X-ray. \n  * Blood tests. \n\nYour APP may recommend you see other healthcare providers. They\u2019ll also talk\nwith you about which medicine(s) to take the morning of your surgery.\n\n#### Identify your caregiver\n\nYour caregiver has an important role in your care. Before your surgery, you\nand your caregiver will learn about your surgery from your healthcare\nproviders. After your surgery, your caregiver will take you home when you\u2019re\ndischarged. They\u2019ll also help you care for yourself at home.\n\n##### For caregivers\n\n\u200c\ufeff  Caring for a person going through cancer treatment comes with many\nresponsibilities. We offer resources and support to help you manage them.\nVisit www.msk.org/caregivers or read A Guide for Caregivers to learn more.\n\n#### Fill out a Health Care Proxy form\n\nIf you have not already filled out a Health Care Proxy form, we recommend you\ndo now. If you already filled one out or have any other advance directives,\nbring them to your next appointment.\n\nA health care proxy is a legal document. It says who will speak for you if you\ncannot communicate for yourself. This person is called your health care agent.\n\n  * To learn about health care proxies and other advance directives, read Advance Care Planning for Cancer Patients and Their Loved Ones . \n  * To learn about being a health care agent, read How to Be a Health Care Agent. \n\nTalk with a member of your care team if you have questions about filling out a\nHealth Care Proxy form.\n\n### 7 days before your surgery\n\n#### Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions for taking aspirin\n\nAspirin can cause bleeding. If you take aspirin or a medicine that has\naspirin, you may need to change your dose or stop taking it 7 days before your\nsurgery. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions. **Do not stop taking\naspirin unless they tell you to.**\n\nTo learn more, read Common Medications Containing Aspirin, Other Nonsteroidal\nAnti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), or Vitamin E.\n\n#### Stop taking vitamin E, multivitamins, herbal remedies, and other dietary\nsupplements\n\nVitamin E, multivitamins, herbal remedies, and other dietary supplements can\ncause bleeding. Stop taking them 7 days before your surgery. If your\nhealthcare provider gives you other instructions, follow those instead.\n\nTo learn more, read Herbal Remedies and Cancer Treatment.\n\n#### Buy clear liquids\n\nYou\u2019ll need to follow a clear liquid diet before your surgery. It\u2019s helpful to\nbuy clear liquids ahead of time. Read the section \u201cFollow a clear liquid diet\u201d\nfor a list of clear liquids you can drink.\n\n### 2 days before your surgery\n\n#### Stop taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\nNSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae and Motrin\u00ae) and naproxen (Aleve\u00ae), can\ncause bleeding. Stop taking them 2 days before your surgery. If your\nhealthcare provider gives you other instructions, follow those instead.\n\nTo learn more, read Common Medications Containing Aspirin, Other Nonsteroidal\nAnti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), or Vitamin E.\n\n### 1 day before your surgery\n\n#### Follow a clear liquid diet\n\nYou\u2019ll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your surgery.

Your healthcare team will use it to teach you how to care for yourself after surgery. \n\n#### Where to park\n\nMSK\u2019s parking garage is on East 66th Street between York and 1st avenues. If\nyou have questions about prices, call 212-639-2338.\n\nTo get to the garage, turn onto East 66th Street from York Avenue. The garage\nis about a quarter of a block in from York Avenue. It\u2019s on the right (north)\nside of the street. There\u2019s a tunnel you can walk through that connects the\ngarage to the hospital.\n\nThere are other parking garages on:\n\n  * East 69th Street between 1st and 2nd avenues. \n  * East 67th Street between York and 1st avenues. \n  * East 65th Street between 1st and 2nd avenues. \n\n#### Once you\u2019re in the hospital\n\nWhen you get to the hospital, take the B elevator to the 6th floor. Check in\nat the desk in the PSC waiting room.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to say and spell your name and birth date many times. This is\nfor your safety. People with the same or a similar name may be having surgery\non the same day.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to change for surgery, you\u2019ll get a hospital gown, robe, and\nnonskid socks to wear.\n\n### Meet with a nurse\n\nYou\u2019ll meet with a nurse before surgery. Tell them the dose of any medicines\nyou took after midnight (12 a.m.) and the time you took them. Make sure to\ninclude prescription and over-the-counter medicines, patches, and creams.\n\nYour nurse may place an intravenous (IV) line in one of your veins, usually in\nyour arm or hand. If your nurse does not place the IV, your anesthesiologist\n(A-nes-THEE-zee-AH-loh-jist) will do it in the operating room.\n\n##### Meet with an anesthesiologist\n\nYou\u2019ll also meet with an anesthesiologist before surgery. They will:\n\n  * Review your medical history with you. \n  * Ask if you\u2019ve had any problems with anesthesia in the past, such as nausea or pain. \n  * Talk with you about your comfort and safety during your surgery. \n  * Talk with you about the kind of anesthesia you\u2019ll get. \n  * Answer your questions about your anesthesia. \n\n#### During your surgery\n\nWhen it\u2019s time for your surgery, you\u2019ll need to remove your hearing aids,\ndentures, prosthetic device(s), wig, and religious articles, if you have them.\nYou\u2019ll either walk into the operating room or be taken in on a stretcher. A\nmember of the operating room team will help you onto the operating bed and\nplace compression boots on your lower legs. These gently inflate and deflate\nto help blood flow in your legs.\n\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable, your anesthesiologist will give you anesthesia\nthrough your IV line and you\u2019ll fall asleep. You\u2019ll also get fluids through\nyour IV line during and after your surgery.\n\nAfter you\u2019re fully asleep, a breathing tube will be placed through your mouth\nand into your windpipe to help you breathe. Your breathing tube is usually\ntaken out while you\u2019re still in the operating room after your surgery. Your\nwound will be covered with gauze and a dressing (bandage).\n\nBack to top\n\n## Recovering after your surgery\n\nThis section will help you know what to expect after your surgery. You\u2019ll\nlearn how to safely recover from your surgery both in the hospital and at\nhome.\n\nAs you read this section, write down questions to ask your healthcare\nprovider.\n\n### In the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)\n\nYou\u2019ll be in the PACU when you wake up after your surgery. A nurse will be\nkeeping track of your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen levels.\nYou may get oxygen through a tube resting below your nose or a mask over your\nnose and mouth. You\u2019ll also have compression boots on your lower legs.\n\n#### Pain medication\n\nYou\u2019ll get medication to control your pain and keep you comfortable. There are\ndifferent ways pain medication can be given:\n\n  * **Nerve block:** Some people get a nerve block before or during surgery. With a nerve block, your doctor injects medication into some of your nerves to reduce pain after surgery. \n  * **IV medications:** Some people get pain medication into a vein through their IV line. \n\nYou\u2019ll have 1 or more of these after your surgery. They\u2019re all effective\nmethods to control your pain. Your healthcare provider will talk with you\nbefore choosing the best one(s) for you.\n\n#### Moving to your hospital room\n\nYou\u2019ll stay in the PACU until you\u2019re awake and your pain is under control.\nMost people move to their hospital room after a few hours in the PACU, but\nsome people stay in the PACU overnight for observation. After your stay in the\nPACU, a staff member will take you to your hospital room.\n\n### In your hospital room\n\nThe length of time you\u2019re in the hospital after your surgery depends on your\nrecovery. Most people stay in the hospital for 2 days. Your healthcare team\nwill tell you what to expect.\n\nWhen you\u2019re taken to your hospital room, you\u2019ll meet one of the nurses who\nwill care for you while you\u2019re in the hospital. Soon after you arrive in your\nroom, your nurse will help you out of bed and into your chair.\n\nWhile you\u2019re in the hospital, your nurses will teach you how to care for\nyourself while you\u2019re recovering from your surgery. You can help yourself\nrecover more quickly by doing the following things:\n\n  * **Read your recovery pathway.** Your healthcare provider will give you a pathway with goals for your recovery, if you don\u2019t already have one. It will help you know what to do and expect on each day during your recovery. \n  * **Start moving around as soon as you can.** The sooner you\u2019re able to get out of bed and walk, the quicker you\u2019ll be able to get back to your normal activities. \n\nYou can use your MyMSK Goals to Discharge Checklist to track your progress\nduring your recovery. For more information, read the resource About Your MyMSK\nGoals to Discharge Checklist.\n\nRead the resource Call! Don't Fall! to learn about what you can do to stay\nsafe and keep from falling while you\u2019re in the hospital.\n\n#### Managing your pain\n\nYou\u2019ll have some pain after your surgery. Your healthcare providers will ask\nyou about your pain often and give you medication as needed. If your pain\nisn\u2019t relieved, tell one of your healthcare providers. It\u2019s important to\ncontrol your pain so you can use your incentive spirometer and move around.\nControlling your pain will help you recover better.\n\nMany people find their pain is controlled with over-the-counter medications\nalone. If you need stronger pain medication in the hospital, one of your\nhealthcare providers will give you a prescription before you leave. Talk with\nyour healthcare providers about possible side effects and how to taper (slowly\nstop taking) your medication.\n\n#### Moving around and walking\n\nMoving around and walking will help lower your risk for blood clots and\npneumonia (lung infection). It will also help you start passing gas and having\nbowel movements (pooping) again.\n\nRead your recovery pathway to learn about your specific moving and walking\ngoals. Your nurse, physical therapist, or occupational therapist will help you\nmove around, if needed.\n\n#### Exercising your lungs\n\nIt\u2019s important to exercise your lungs so they expand fully. This helps prevent\npneumonia.\n\n  * Your nurse will give you an incentive spirometer. Use it 10 times every hour you\u2019re awake. For instructions for using your incentive spirometer, read the resource How To Use Your Incentive Spirometer. \n  * Do coughing and deep breathing exercises. A member of your care team will teach you how to do them. \n\n#### Eating and drinking\n\nRight after your surgery, you won\u2019t be able to eat solid foods. You\u2019ll follow\na liquid diet. After that, you\u2019ll slowly start eating solid foods. This\nusually happens the day after your surgery.\n\nA clinical dietitian nutritionist will give you more information about eating\nafter surgery before you leave the hospital.\n\n#### Caring for your wound\n\nYou\u2019ll have a wound where your ileostomy used to be. It won\u2019t be closed with\nsutures (stitches) or staples, and it will be very raw and red. This is\nnormal.\n\nYour nurse will pack (fill) your wound with gauze and change your bandage\nevery day while you\u2019re in the hospital. They\u2019ll also teach you how to do it\nyourself. They will have you practice packing your wound and changing your\ndressing before you go home. It\u2019s helpful if your caregiver also learns how to\ncare for your wound. This will make it easier for them to help you care for\nyourself at home.\n\nYour wound should close 4 to 6 weeks after your surgery.\n\n#### Planning for your discharge\n\nYour nurse will give you supplies so you can care for your wound at home. Most\npeople also have a nurse visit them at home to help you as you heal. Your case\nmanager (a member of your healthcare team who helps to plan and coordinate\nyour services) will discuss this with you when planning your discharge.\n\n#### Leaving the hospital\n\nBefore you leave the hospital, look at your wound with one of your healthcare\nproviders. Knowing what your wound looks like will help you notice any changes\nlater.\n\n**On the day of your discharge, plan to leave the hospital between 8:00 a.m.\nand 10:00 a.m.** Before you leave, one of your healthcare providers will write\nyour discharge order and prescriptions. You\u2019ll also get written discharge\ninstructions. One of your healthcare providers will review them with you\nbefore you leave.\n\nIf your ride isn\u2019t at the hospital when you\u2019re ready to be discharged, you may\nbe able to wait in the Patient Transition Lounge. A member of your healthcare\nteam will give you more information.\n\n### At home\n\nRead What You Can Do to Avoid Falling to learn what you can do to keep from\nfalling at home and during your appointments at MSK.\n\n#### Filling out your Recovery Tracker\n\nWe want to know how you\u2019re feeling after you leave the hospital. To help us\ncare for you, we\u2019ll send questions to your MyMSK account. We\u2019ll send them\nevery day for 10 days after you\u2019re discharged. These questions are known as\nyour Recovery Tracker.\n\nFill out your Recovery Tracker every day before midnight (12 a.m.). It only\ntakes 2 to 3 minutes to complete. Your answers to these questions will help us\nunderstand how you\u2019re feeling and what you need.\n\nBased on your answers, we may reach out to you for more information.\nSometimes, we may ask you to call your surgeon\u2019s office. You can always\ncontact your surgeon\u2019s office if you have any questions.\n\nTo learn more, read About Your Recovery Tracker.\n\n#### Caring for your wound\n\nFollow your healthcare team\u2019s instructions for how often to change the gauze\nand bandage over your wound. Most people have a visiting nurse come to their\nhome to help them. To prevent infection, clean your hands with soap and water\nor an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before you touch your wound.\n\nCheck your wound every day for any signs of infection until your healthcare\nprovider tells you it\u2019s healed. Call your healthcare provider if you see any\nof the following signs of a wound infection:\n\n  * A fever of 100.5 \u00b0F (38.0 \u00b0C) or higher \n  * Swelling around your wound \n  * Increased pain that doesn\u2019t get better with medication \n  * Drainage that looks like pus (thick and milky) \n\n#### Managing your pain\n\nPeople have pain or discomfort for different lengths of time. You may still\nhave some pain when you go home and will probably be taking pain medication.\nThe pain usually gets better within 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nFollow these guidelines to help manage your pain at home.\n\n  * Take your medicine(s) as directed and as needed. \n  * Call your healthcare provider if the medicine prescribed for you does not help your pain. \n  * Do not drive or drink alcohol while you\u2019re taking prescription pain medicine. Some prescription pain medicines can make you drowsy (very sleepy). Alcohol can make the drowsiness worse. \n  * You\u2019ll have less pain and need less pain medicine as your incision heals. An over-the-counter pain reliever will help with aches and discomfort. Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) and ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae or Motrin\u00ae) are examples of over-the-counter pain relievers.\n    * Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions for stopping your prescription pain medicine.\n    * Do not take too much of any medicine. Follow the instructions on the label or from your healthcare provider.\n    * Read the labels on all the medicines you\u2019re taking. This is very important if you\u2019re taking acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription medicines. Taking too much can harm your liver. Do not take more than one medicine that has acetaminophen without talking with a member of your care team.\n  * Pain medicine should help you get back to your usual activities. Take enough to do your activities and exercises comfortably. You may have a little more pain as you start to be more active. \n  * Keep track of when you take your pain medicine. It works best 30 to 45 minutes after you take it. Taking it when you first have pain is better than waiting for the pain to get worse. \n\n#### Managing changes in bowel function\n\nYour rectum is a storage tank for stool (poop). You had surgery to remove part\nof it, so now this tank  \nis smaller. You may have a lot of small bowel movements because your rectum\ncan\u2019t hold as much stool. Over time, your rectum will stretch and be able to\nhold more. This process can take several months to years.\n\nFor the first few weeks after your surgery, you may have a lot of bowel\nmovements. This is because the lower part of your colon hasn\u2019t been used in a\nwhile. It will take time for your body to recover.\n\nAfter your surgery, your bowel movements may:\n\n  * Be more frequent. \n  * Happen several times an hour, several times a week. \n  * Happen every other day. \n  * Not feel complete. After having a bowel movement, you may still feel like you have to go. \n\nYou also may:\n\n  * Feel a strong sense of urgency to have a bowel movement. \n  * Have trouble telling the difference between having a bowel movement and passing gas. \n\nIf you also had radiation therapy, your rectum may be stiff. It won\u2019t be able\nto stretch and hold stool as well as before your surgery. This is usually\ntemporary.\n\n##### Tips for managing frequent bowel movements\n\nIf you\u2019re having multiple bowel movements a day, you may need to follow a\nbland diet for a few days. While you\u2019re following a bland diet, avoid:\n\n  * Dairy products, including milk, cheese and ice cream \n  * Coffee \n  * Chocolate \n  * Spicy foods \n  * Fried foods \n  * Gravies and cream sauces \n  * High-fat deli meats \n  * Greasy meats, such as sausage and bacon \n  * Fruit juices \n  * Sugar-free foods \n\nFollowing the BRAT diet can also help control frequent bowel movements. The\nBRAT diet is made up mostly of:\n\n  * Bananas (B) \n  * White rice (R) \n  * Applesauce (A) \n  * Toast (T) \n\nDrinking black tea can also help.\n\n##### Tips for managing soreness\n\nYou may have soreness around your anus from frequent bowel movements:\n\n  * Soak in warm water 2 to 3 times a day. \n  * Apply zinc oxide ointment (Desitin\u00ae) to the skin around your anus after every bowel movement. This helps prevent irritation. \n  * Don\u2019t use harsh toilet paper. You can use a nonalcohol wipe (such as a moistened flushable wipe) instead. \n  * If your doctor prescribes medication, take it as directed. \n\n#### Showering\n\nTaking a warm shower is relaxing and can help decrease muscle aches.\n\nTake your bandages off before you shower. When you shower, use soap to gently\nwash your wound. After your shower, pat your wound dry with a clean towel.\nPack your wound with gauze and change your bandage.\n\nDon\u2019t take tub baths or go swimming until your healthcare provider says it\u2019s\nokay.\n\n#### Eating and drinking\n\nEat 5 to 6 small meals throughout the day. Remember to eat slowly and chew\nyour food well. It\u2019s important you try to maintain your weight. Drink 8 to 10\n(8-ounce) glasses of liquids every day.\n\nAfter your surgery, foods may affect you differently. Certain foods may make\nyou have bowel movements right after you eat them. Certain foods may cause\ndiarrhea (loose or watery bowel movements). You may need to change your diet\nafter your surgery.\n\nEvery person is different, so there\u2019s no way to know which foods will make\nthis happen. During the first few months after your surgery, you\u2019ll need to\ntest foods and see how you react to them. It may be helpful to keep a food\ndiary. This will help you keep track of which foods cause discomfort.\n\nIf you have questions about your diet, ask to see a clinical dietitian\nnutritionist.\n\n#### Dietary supplements and medications\n\nIt may be helpful to take a dietary supplement or medication to help your\nbowel function after surgery. **Don\u2019t take these things without talking with\nyour healthcare provider first.**\n\n##### Fiber\n\nYour healthcare provider may tell you to take a fiber supplement (such as\nMetamucil\u00ae or Citrucel\u00ae) starting about 4 weeks after your surgery. Fiber will\nhelp you by:\n\n  * Increasing the bulk in your stool. This helps move waste out of your body because your rectum squeezes better when it\u2019s full. \n  * Stretching your rectum by adding bulk to your stool. This stretching takes place over many months, but eventually your bowel movements should become less frequent and less urgent. This will combine all of the small pieces of stool together to create a larger bowel movement. These larger stools will also stretch out your rectum and you will be able to hold more stool. \n\nStart by taking \u00bd to 1 teaspoon a day and take more of it as needed. Fiber can\ncause constipation if you\u2019re not drinking enough, so drink at least 8\n(8-ounce) glasses (2 liters) of water or clear liquids each day. If you have\nbloating and gas, take simethicone (GasX\u00ae) as needed.\n\n##### Probiotics\n\nYou may also need to take a probiotic supplement. Taking probiotics may help\nyour bowels work better. Ask your healthcare provider for recommendations.\n\n##### Other medications\n\nIf you\u2019re having many bowel movements, your healthcare provider may prescribe\nmedication to slow your bowel down. This may help decrease the feeling that\nyou need to go right away and may cut down on your number of bowel movements.\nYour healthcare provider will tell you how much to take and how often to take\nit.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a bowel movement for 2 days, contact your healthcare\nprovider.\n\n#### Physical activity and exercise\n\nFor the first 6 to 8 weeks after your surgery:\n\n  * Don\u2019t lift, push, or pull anything heavier than 10 pounds (about 4.5 kilograms). \n  * Don\u2019t do any strenuous activities (such as jogging and tennis). \n  * Don\u2019t play any contact sports (such as football). \n\nDoing aerobic exercise, such as walking and stair climbing, will help you gain\nstrength and feel better. Walk at least 2 to 3 times a day for 15 to 20\nminutes for the first 2 weeks after surgery. You can walk outside or indoors\nat your local mall or shopping center. Ask your healthcare provider before\nstarting more demanding exercises.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to have less energy than usual after your surgery. Recovery time\nis different for each person. Increase your activities each day as much as you\ncan. Always balance activity periods with rest periods. But, if you can\u2019t\nsleep at night, it may be a sign that you\u2019re resting too much during the day.\n\n#### Kegel exercises\n\nYou\u2019ll need to do Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.\nThis will help you hold in your bowel movements until you get to a toilet and\nprevent accidental stool leakage (incontinence) after your ileostomy is\nclosed.\n\nAsk your healthcare provider when to start doing Kegel exercises. Starting too\nsoon after surgery can be painful.\n\nYou can do Kegel exercises while you\u2019re sitting, standing, and walking. To do\nKegel exercises:\n\n  1. Tighten your pelvic floor muscles (the muscles you tighten when you\u2019re trying to hold back a bowel movement). \n  2. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds. \n  3. Release and rest. \n\nRepeat this exercise 10 times, 4 times a day.\n\n#### Driving\n\nYou can start driving again 2 weeks after your surgery. Don\u2019t drive while\nyou\u2019re taking pain medication that may make you drowsy. You can ride in a car\nas a passenger at any time after you leave the hospital.\n\n#### Going back to work\n\nTalk with your healthcare provider about your job. They\u2019ll tell you when it\nmay be safe for you to start working again based on what you do. If you move\naround a lot or lift heavy objects, you may need to stay out a little longer.\nIf you sit at a desk, you may be able to go back sooner.\n\n#### Follow-up appointments\n\nYour first appointment after your surgery will be 1 to 3 weeks after you leave\nthe hospital. Call your surgeon\u2019s office after you\u2019re discharged from the\nhospital to schedule it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to go to all your follow-up appointments after your surgery.\nYou can call your healthcare provider if you have questions between these\nappointments.\n\n#### Managing your feelings\n\nAfter surgery for a serious illness, you may have new and upsetting feelings.\nMany people say they felt weepy, sad, worried, nervous, irritable, and angry\nat one time or another. You may find that you can\u2019t control some of these\nfeelings. If this happens, it\u2019s a good idea to seek emotional support.
