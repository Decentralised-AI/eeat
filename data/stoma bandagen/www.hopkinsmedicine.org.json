A colostomy may be temporary or permanent. It\nis usually done after bowel surgery or injury. Most permanent colostomies are\n\"end colostomies,\" while many temporary colostomies bring the side of the\ncolon up to an opening in the abdomen.\n\nDuring an end colostomy, the end of the colon is brought through the abdominal\nwall, where it may be turned under, like a cuff. The edges of the colon are\nthen stitched to the skin of the abdominal wall to form an opening called a\n**stoma**. Stool drains from the stoma into a bag or pouch attached to the\nabdomen. In a temporary \"loop colostomy,\" a hole is cut in the side of the\ncolon and stitched to a corresponding hole in the abdominal wall. This can be\nmore easily reversed later by simply detaching the colon from the abdominal\nwall and closing the holes to reestablish the flow of stool through the colon.\n\n## Reasons for the procedure\n\nColostomy surgery may be needed to treat several different diseases and\nconditions. These include:\n\n  * Birth defect, such as a blocked or missing anal opening, called an imperforate anus\n\n  * Serious infection, such as diverticulitis, inflammation of little sacs on the colon\n\n  * Inflammatory bowel disease\n\n  * Injury to the colon or rectum\n\n  * Partial or complete intestinal or bowel blockage\n\n  * Rectal or colon cancer\n\n  * Wounds or fistulas in the perineum. A fistula is an abnormal connection between internal parts of the body, or between an internal organ and the skin. A woman's perineum is the area between her anus and vulva; a man's lies between his anus and scrotum.\n\nThe reason for the colostomy helps the healthcare provider decide whether it\nwill be short-term or permanent. For example, some infections or injuries\nrequire giving the bowel a temporary rest, then reattaching it. A permanent\ncolostomy may be required for a more serious or incurable problem, such as\ncancer that requires removal of the rectum, or a failure of the muscles that\ncontrol elimination.\n\n## How the digestive system works\n\nA colostomy won't change the way your digestive system works. Normally, after\nyou chew and swallow your food, it goes through your esophagus, or swallowing\ntube, into your stomach.\n\nFrom there, it travels to your small intestine and then to your large\nintestine, or colon. Hours or days later, the indigestible residue leaves the\nstorage area of your rectum via your anus, as stool. Stool typically stays\nloose and liquid during its passage through the upper colon. There, water is\nabsorbed from it, so the stool gets firmer as it nears the rectum.\n\nThe ascending colon goes up the right side of your body. The stool here is\nliquid and somewhat acidic, and it contains digestive enzymes. The transverse\ncolon goes across your upper abdomen, and the descending and sigmoid colon go\ndown the left side of your body to your rectum. In the left colon, the stool\nbecomes progressively less liquid, less acidic, and contains fewer enzymes.\n\nWhere your colon is interrupted determines how irritating to the skin your\nstool output will be. The more liquid the stool, the more important it will be\nto protect your abdominal skin after a colostomy.\n\n## Risks of the procedure\n\nGetting a colostomy marks a big change in your life, but the surgery itself is\nuncomplicated. It will be performed under general anesthesia, so you will be\nunconscious and feel no pain. A colostomy may be done as open surgery, or\nlaparoscopically, via several tiny cuts.\n\nAs with any surgery, the main risks for anesthesia are breathing problems and\npoor reactions to medications. A colostomy carries other surgical risks:\n\n  * Bleeding\n\n  * Damage to nearby organs\n\n  * Infection\n\nAfter surgery, risks include:\n\n  * Narrowing of the colostomy opening\n\n  * Scar tissue that causes intestinal blockage\n\n  * Skin irritation\n\n  * Wound opening\n\n  * Developing a hernia at the incision\n\n## Before the procedure\n\nIf possible, be sure to discuss your surgical and postsurgical options with a\ndoctor and an ostomy nurse (a nurse who is specially trained to help colostomy\npatients) before surgery. It may also help to meet with an ostomy visitor.\nThis is a volunteer who has had a colostomy and can help you understand how to\nlive with one. And, before or after your surgery, you may wish to attend an\nostomy support group. You can find out more about such groups from the United\nOstomy Associations of America or the American Cancer Society.\n\n## During the procedure\n\nDepending on why you need a colostomy, it will be made in one of 4 parts of\nthe colon: ascending, transverse, descending, or sigmoid.\n\n  * A **transverse colostomy** is performed on the middle section of the colon, and the stoma will be somewhere across the upper abdomen. This type of surgery--often temporary--is typically performed for diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, blockage, injury or a birth defect. In a transverse colostomy, the stool leaves the colon through the stoma before reaching the descending colon. Your stoma may have one or two openings. One opening is for stool. The second possible stoma is for the mucus that the resting part of your colon normally keeps producing. If you have only one stoma, this mucus will pass through your rectum and anus.\n\n  * An **ascending colostomy** goes on the right side of your abdomen, leaving only a short part of the colon active. It is generally performed only when blockage or severe disease prevents a colostomy further along the colon.\n\n  * A **descending colostomy** goes on the lower left side of the abdomen, while a **sigmoid colostomy--** the most common type--is placed a few inches lower.\n\n## After the procedure\n\nYou may be able to suck on ice chips on the same day as your surgery. You'll\nprobably be given clear fluids the next day. Some people eat normally within\ntwo days after a colostomy.\n\nA normal stoma is moist and pink or red colored. When you first see your\ncolostomy, it may appear dark red and swollen, with bruises. Don't worry.\nWithin a few weeks, the color will lighten and bruises should disappear.\n\nThe bandage or clear pouch covering your colostomy right after surgery\nprobably won't be the same type that you'll use at home. Your colostomy will\ndrain stool from your colon into this colostomy pouch or bag. Your stool will\nprobably be more liquid than before surgery. Your stool consistency will also\ndepend on what type of colostomy you have and how much of your colon is still\nactive.\n\n### In the hospital\n\nA colostomy requires a hospital stay of about 3 days to a week. Your stay will\nprobably be longer if the colostomy was performed for an emergency. During\nyour hospital stay, you'll learn to care for your colostomy and the appliance\nor pouch that collects your stool.\n\nYour nurse will show you how to clean your stoma. After you go home, you'll do\nthis gently every day with warm water only. Then gently pat dry or allow the\narea to air dry. Don't worry if you see a little bit of blood.\n\nUse your time in the hospital to learn how to care for your colostomy. If you\nhave an ascending or transverse colostomy, you will need to wear a slim,\nlightweight, drainable pouch at all times. There are many different types of\npouches, varying in cost and made from odor-resistant materials.\n\nSome people with a descending or sigmoid colostomy can eventually learn to\npredict when their bowels will move and wear a pouch only when they expect a\nmovement. They may also be able to master a process called irrigation to\nstimulate regular, controlled bowel movements.\n\nBefore going home, be sure to talk with an ostomy nurse or other expert who\ncan help you try out the equipment you'll need. What works best will depend on\nwhat type of colostomy you have; the length of your stoma; your abdominal\nshape and firmness; any scars or folds near the stoma; and your height and\nweight.\n\nSometimes, the rectum and anus must be surgically removed, leaving what's\ncalled a posterior wound. In the hospital, you'll use dressings and pads to\ncover this wound, and you may also take sitz baths--shallow, warm-water soaks.\nAsk your doctor and nurse how to care for your posterior wound until it heals.\nIf problems should occur, please contact your doctor.\n\n### At home\n\nThe skin around your stoma should look the same as elsewhere on your abdomen.\nExposure to stool, especially loose stool, can be irritating. Here are some\ntips to protect your skin:\n\n  1. Make sure your pouch and skin barrier opening are the right size.\n\n  2. Change the pouch regularly to avoid leakage and skin irritation. Don't wait until your skin begins to itch and burn.\n\n  3. Remove the pouching system gently, pushing your skin away instead of pulling.\n\n  4. Barrier creams may be used if the skin becomes irritated despite these measures.\n\nNotify your doctor to report any of the following:\n\n  * Cramps that last more than two hours\n\n  * Continuous nausea or throwing up\n\n  * Bad or unusual odor for more than a week\n\n  * Change in your stoma size or color\n\n  * Blocked or bulging stoma\n\n  * Bleeding from the stoma opening or in the pouch\n\n  * Wound or cut in the stoma\n\n  * Serious skin irritation or sores\n\n  * Watery stool for more than five hours\n\n  * Anything unusual that concerns you\n\nA good rule is to empty your pouch when it's one-third full. And be sure to\nchange the pouch before it leaks. As a general rule, change it no more than\nonce a day, but not less than every three or four days.\n\nA colostomy represents a big change, but you will soon learn to live with it.\nEven though you can feel the pouch against your body, no one else can see it.\nDo not feel the need to explain your colostomy to everyone who asks; only\nshare as much as you want to.\n\nFind a Doctor\n\nSpecializing In:\n\n  * Colon Surgery\n  * Colon and Rectal Surgery\n\nAt Another Johns Hopkins Member Hospital:\n\n  * Howard County Medical Center\n  * Sibley Memorial Hospital\n  * Suburban Hospital\n\nFind a Treatment Center\n\n  * Gastroenterology and Hepatology\n\nFind Additional Treatment Centers at:\n\n  * Howard County Medical Center\n  * Sibley Memorial Hospital\n  * Suburban Hospital\n\n### Related\n\nLynch Syndrome Treatment Colectomy Colorectal Cancer: 3 Treatment Advances to\nKnow About Colon Cancer Treatment\n\n### Request an Appointment\n\nFind a Doctor\n\n  * 410-955-5000 Maryland\n  * 855-695-4872 Outside of Maryland\n  * +1-410-502-7683 International\n\nFind a Doctor\n\nSee More\n\nFind a Doctor\n\nSpecializing In:\n\n  * Colon Surgery\n  * Colon and Rectal Surgery\n\nAt Another Johns Hopkins Member Hospital:\n\n  * Howard County Medical Center\n  * Sibley Memorial Hospital\n  * Suburban Hospital\n\nFind a Treatment Center\n\n  * Gastroenterology and Hepatology\n\nFind Additional Treatment Centers at:\n\n  * Howard County Medical Center\n  * Sibley Memorial Hospital\n  * Suburban Hospital\n\n### Related\n\n  * Gastroenterology\n\nLynch Syndrome Treatment\n\n  * Colon Cancer\n\nColectomy\n\n  * Colon Surgery\n\nColorectal Cancer: 3 Treatment Advances to Know About\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Gastroenterology\n  * Colon Surgery\n\n## Health\n\n  * Conditions and Diseases\n  * Treatments, Tests and Therapies\n  * Wellness and Prevention\n  * Caregiving\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine logo\n\nLanguage Assistance Available:\n\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Tagalog\n  * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n  * Portugu\u00eas\n  * Italiano\n  * Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n  * \u0181\u00e0s\u0254\u0301\u0254\u0300-w\u00f9\u0256\u00f9-po-ny\u0254\u0300\n  * Igbo asusu\n  * \u00e8d\u00e8 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1\n  * \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n  * Krey\u00f2l Ayisyen\n  * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n  * Deutsch\n  * Polski\n  * \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n  * \u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0\n  * \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n  * \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648\n  * \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n  * \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940\n  * Deitsch\n  * \u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a\n  *   * \n\nContact & Privacy Information\n\nContact Us | Patient Care Locations\n\nNotice of Privacy Practices | Privacy Statement\n\nTerms & Conditions of Use | Non-Discrimination Notice\n\n__Follow on Facebook\n\n __Follow on Twitter\n\n __Follow on Linkedin\n\n __Follow on Instagram\n\n __Follow on YouTube\n\n __Follow on Weibo\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and\nJohns Hopkins Health System.
