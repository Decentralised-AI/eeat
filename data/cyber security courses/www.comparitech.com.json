Coursera Introduction to Cyber Security Specialization\n\nThe way Coursera works is by grouping multiple courses into a\n\u201cspecialization.\u201d You can take all courses within a specialization or choose\nspecific ones. Each specialization includes a hands-on project which you\u2019ll\nhave to complete in order to earn a certificate.\n\nThe Introduction to Cyber Security specialization includes four courses:\n\n  * **Introduction to Cyber Attacks:** Provides a basic understanding of threats and vulnerabilities, and an overview of how cyberattacks are carried out.\n  * **Cyber Attack Countermeasures:** Teaches the basics of cyber defense and cryptography, including authentication solutions and public-key cryptography.\n  * **Real-Time Cyber Threat Detection and Mitigation:** Discusses real-time cybersecurity techniques and how to detect and prevent common attacks.\n  * **Enterprise and Infrastructure Security:** Introduces more advanced topics such as enterprise compliance frameworks and issues in blockchain and mobile security.\n\nThis set of courses goes beyond the basics, so is less suitable for home users\nlooking to boost their cybersecurity knowledge. Instead, it\u2019s targed more\ntowards business owners or would-be cybersecurity professionals. **The\nsuggested time frame to complete this course is around four months** ,\nassuming you do four hours of study each week. The best thing about online\nlearning is that you can go at a pace that suits you, though, so take as long\nas you need.\n\nYou can take many individual Coursera courses for free. However, to complete a\nspecialization and its corresponding hands-on project to get a certificate,\nyou\u2019ll have to pay a monthly fee. Specializations come with a seven-day free\ntrial after which they cost between $49 and $79 per month for each\nspecialization. This means the quicker you get through the courses and\nprojects, the less you have to pay. Alternatively, you can sign up for\nCoursera Plus, which costs $59 per month and allows access to more than 7,000\nspecializations with no additional fees.\n\nOnce you\u2019re finished with this specialization, there are others you can\nundertake, such as Cybersecurity for Business and Applied Cryptography.\n\n* * *\n\n## 3\\. Guardz\n\n**Guardz** presents two channels for end user security training: the first is\na library of video-based courses and the second is a phishing simulator, which\ncan be used to construct in-house training exercises.

One of its\nmain features is protection or the Google Workspace and Microsoft 465 systems.\nThis focuses on the email packages and cloud drives in each suite. The system\nis packaged in plans that are priced per user per month and all plans include\ncybersecurity protection, the Employee Awareness Training system, and the\nPhishing Simulator.\n\nThe Employee Awareness Training system is hosted on the Guardz cloud platform.\nUsers and administrators access the console for the service through any\nstandard Web browser. The awareness training is implemented as a library of\ncourses \u2013 each of which includes multiple videos. The administrator assigns a\ncourse to an individual or group of users and then gets feedback through the\nsystem as the user progresses through the course. The videos don\u2019t all have to\nbe viewed in one session, giving each user the flexibility to device on the\npace of learning.\n\nThe administrator is able to see in the Guardz console how many of the users\nwho have been allocated a course have actually completed it. It is then\npossible to run tests by generating phishing emails to challenge each user.\nOnce everyone has absorbed the guidance of the courses, the administrator can\nturn on the cybersecurity protection system, which filters out malicious\nemails.\n\nThe lowest plan is called Starter and it includes the Employee Awareness\nTraining package. This is priced at \u00a35 per user per month. You can assess the\nGuardz system with a 14-day free trial.\n\n* * *\n\n## 4\\.

If you\u2019re not on a tight\nbudget, this piece of paper might be worth it, but for many, it\u2019s simply\ninaccessible.\n\n## Why take a cybersecurity course?\n\nCybercrime is a growing problem. Almost everyone uses the web in some way,\nand even the relatively few who shy away from technology still have to deal\nwith companies for which cybercrime is a real potential threat. As such, it\nhas become a basic requirement for people to make themselves aware of the\nrisks that are out there. Here are the three great reasons to take a\ncybersecurity course:\n\n  * **To protect yourself and your family:** It\u2019s easy to plead ignorance and say that we should leave things to the experts, but think of it this way: the police catch thieves, but that doesn\u2019t mean we make a habit of leaving our front doors unlocked or leaving our keys in the car. The fight against cybercrime needs to be a group effort, and educating yourself on threats and how to mitigate them is a great place to start.\n  * **To protect your business:** Businesses, large and small, are at risk of falling behind when it comes to cybersecurity. All too often business-owners only decide to step up their game when it\u2019s too late and they\u2019ve already suffered losses. DDoS attacks, data breaches, phishing schemes, and more can trigger major monetary losses and a lot of stress. Taking a cybersecurity course can help you be proactive in beefing up your business\u2019 cybersecurity before it\u2019s too late.\n  * **To pursue a cybersecurity career:** If you\u2019re passionate about cybersecurity and think you\u2019d like to pursue a career in the field, you\u2019re in luck. It\u2019s predicted that by 2025, there will be 3.5 million cybersecurity job openings. This industry is expected to grow from $175 billion in 2015 to $1.75 trillion in 2025. E-learning courses are low cost, and with suitable qualifications can open up the potential to a high-paid career in cybersecurity.\n\n## Tips for pursuing a cybersecurity career\n\nDo you think a cybersecurity career could be right for you? Below we\u2019ve put\ntogether our top four tips to help any beginner launch a cybersecurity career.\n\n**Here are some tips to help you get started in cybersecurity:**\n\n  1. **Explore different areas of cybersecurity:** There are so many directions a career in cybersecurity can take so it\u2019s a good idea to explore all options and not narrow things down too quickly.
