Based on the available data, it is evident that edX and WGU offer specific pricing for their cyber security courses, while INE, Pluralsight, A Cloud Guru, and Flow do not provide detailed pricing information. WGU follows an online education model with flat-rate tuition and competency-based learning, while edX focuses on boot camps for coding education. INE offers a new pricing structure with access to all training verticals at a lower price point and a new monthly subscription option.

It is important to note that the absence of pricing information for some platforms makes it challenging to provide a comprehensive comparison. Additionally, the specific features and course content offered by each platform would also play a significant role in evaluating the value of their cyber security courses.
