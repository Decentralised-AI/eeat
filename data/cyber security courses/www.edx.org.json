Why is cybersecurity important?\nThere are many types of cybersecurity threats, including theft, hacking,\nviruses, and more. The computer security field has grown as more devices\nbecome internet-enabled and more services are moved online.\n\nCyberattacks may result in stolen credit card information, personal details,\nand other sensitive data. Security breaches typically occur when\norganizations\u2019 and companies\u2019 data centers are compromised. They can impact\nbanks, retail stores, online websites, and anywhere else consumers use their\ndigital information. Hackers also use fraudulent emails and social media to\naccess sensitive data from end-users. IT and cybersecurity experts are\nresponsible for assessing security risks in order to better protect customers.\n\nCompanies that collect and store private information employ cyber safety and\nsecurity measures to prevent the loss of data or disruption of business, and\nthe availability of cybersecurity jobs is tied to this need. These roles may\nbe specific to a division of cybersecurity, such as application security,\nnetwork security, cloud security, and mobile security. Additionally,\ncybersecurity specialists may participate in defensive security practices,\nwhile others may focus on testing through activities such as \u201cwhite hat\u201d\nhacking.\n\n## Browse online Cybersecurity courses\n\n### Find new interests and advance your career opportunities\n\nCoursesCourses\n\nExplore all courses\n\n#### Stand out in your field\n\nUse the knowledge and skills you have gained to drive impact at work and grow\nyour career.\n\n#### Learn at your own pace\n\nOn your computer, tablet or phone, online courses make learning flexible to\nfit your busy life.\n\n#### Earn a valuable credential\n\nShowcase your key skills and valuable knowledge.\n\nExplore all courses\n\n##\n\n#### Common types of cybersecurity threats\n\nInformation can be compromised through a variety of tactics. Examples of\ncommon cyberthreats include:Footnote 1\n\n  * **Malware:** Short for \u201cmalicious software,\u201d malware variants include worms, viruses, trojans, and spyware. These types of software can give cyberattackers unauthorized access to data or cause damage to a computer system. \n\n  *  **Ransomware:** Ransomware is another type of malware that can lock down computer systems with the threat to destroy or compromise sensitive data unless a ransom is paid to the cyberattacker. \n\n  *  **Phishing:** Phishing is a tactic that attempts to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as their username and password to an account, credit card number, or personal information. This type of scam sends messages from seemingly legitimate organizations asking for the information they intend to steal for their use. \n\n  *  **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks:** These types of cyberattacks attempt to crash a server, network, or website by overloading it with traffic. DDoS attacks typically use multiple coordinated systems to achieve the goal of overwhelming the system. \n\n####  Online cybersecurity course curriculum\n\nCybersecurity course curricula will vary based on the type of program, level\nof learning, and other factors. For example, an introductory course that\nfocuses on cybersecurity fundamentals may cover:\n\n  * Network and system administration basics, such as data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. \n\n  * Protections that cybersecurity professionals use to secure network infrastructures, monitor threats, and implement security solutions. \n\n  * The different branches of cybersecurity, including application security, network and infrastructure security, and digital forensics and incident response. \n\nCybersecurity analyst certification courses and cybersecurity boot camps can\nalso provide a more in-depth focus on cybersecurity tools and best practices\nfor aspiring professionals, including how to perform digital forensic\nanalysis, risk analysis, and vulnerability assessments in enterprise\nenvironments.\n\n#### Cybersecurity training for beginners\n\nFor those who are interested in exploring cybersecurity careers, it can be\nhelpful to take an introductory class to see if cybersecurity is a good fit.\nThere are many low-cost or free cybersecurity courses online that cover\ncybersecurity fundamentals, how to start a career in cybersecurity, and more.\nIntroductory classes may cover different areas of cybersecurity, such as\nsecure software development, network security, and cloud security. These\ncourses provide an overview on important cybersecurity terms, how security\ndesign works, industry standards and principles, and different models for\nsecurity.\n\n##\n\n###  Cybersecurity jobs\n\nThere are many types of cybersecurity jobs that play unique roles in keeping\ncomputer systems secure.
