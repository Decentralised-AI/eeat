These free classes cover many topics relevant to\ncybersecurity professionals, including networking, operating systems, database\nmanagement, and security.\n\nMost MOOCs require students to interact with other participants through\nmessage boards or forums. While many MOOCs do not offer college credit and are\nnot geared toward postgraduate study, they can be useful tools for anyone\ninterested in learning more about cybersecurity.\n\nThis guide explores the top free online cybersecurity courses and who should\ntake them.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Free Online Courses in Cybersecurity\n\nThe main benefit of free online cybersecurity training is cost. Because MOOCs\nare usually free, students can use them to explore topics relevant to degrees\nin cybersecurity or related fields without incurring high tuition bills. The\nmain drawback is that most free online courses do not provide the hands-on\nexperience of an in-person classroom.\n\nConsider these other pros and cons of cybersecurity MOOCs:\n\n### Pros of Free Online Cybersecurity Classes\n\n  * Students can learn at their own pace.\n  * No admission requirements like minimum GPA or standardized test scores.\n  * Often, professors at prominent schools prepare MOOC content.\n\n### Cons of Free Online Cybersecurity Classes\n\n  * While some free courses lead to certificates, those certificates often require tuition.\n  * According to a study published in Science, many students don't complete the MOOCs in which they enroll. In the 2017-18 school year, only 3.13% of learners completed their courses.\n  * Students receive little or no personalized attention or courseware.\n\nShould you pursue a degree in cybersecurity?\n\nConsider attending a cybersecurity bootcamp\n\nLearn more about earning a certificate in cybersecurity\n\n## Who Benefits From Free Cybersecurity Classes?\n\nStudents looking to enter the cybersecurity field from a variety of\neducational backgrounds can benefit from free online courses.\n\nFor students with no prior experience, free cybersecurity training can teach\nthem about the basics of information security. Professionals who already work\nin the field but want to enhance their skills can benefit from classes that\nfocus on current trends in cybersecurity. Organizations sometimes use free\ncybersecurity training courses for career development and employee training.\n\n## Free Online Cybersecurity Courses\n\nStudents can access all courses below for free, though our list is not\nexhaustive.
