Your team can no longer afford to use\nantiquated incident response and threat hunting techniques that fail to\nproperly identify compromised systems. The key is to constantly look for\nattacks that get past security systems, and to catch intrusions in progress,\nrather than after attackers have completed their objectives and done worse\ndamage to the organization. For the incident responder, this process is known\nas \" threat hunting \". FOR508 teaches advanced skills to hunt, identify,\ncounter, and recover from a wide range of threats within enterprise networks,\nincluding APT nation-state adversaries, organized crime syndicates, and\nransomeware operators.\n\nCertification:\n\n    * GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)\n\nCourse Syllabus  Pricing & Training Options\n\n  * Cybersecurity and IT Essentials\n\nSEC275: Foundations: Computers, Technology, & Security\n\nSANS Foundations is the most comprehensive, certified introductory\ncybersecurity course on the market.

Something that is unclear to many, is that organizations are still\nresponsible for securing their data and mission-critical applications in the\ncloud. The benefits in terms of cost and speed of leveraging a multi cloud\nplatform to develop and accelerate delivery of business applications and\nanalyze customer data can quickly be reversed if security professionals are\nnot properly trained to secure the organization's cloud environment and\ninvestigate and respond to the inevitable security breaches. New technologies\nintroduce new risks. The SEC488 cloud security course helps your organization\nsuccessfully navigate both the security challenges and opportunities presented\nby cloud services. 20 Hands-on Labs + CloudWars Capstone Challenge.\n\nCertification:\n\n    * GIAC Cloud Security Essentials (GCLD)\n\nCourse Syllabus  Pricing & Training Options\n\n  * Major Update\n\nDigital Forensics, Incident Response & Threat Hunting\n\nFOR500: Windows Forensic Analysis\n\nFOR500 builds comprehensive digital forensics knowledge of Microsoft Windows\noperating systems providing the means to recover, analyze, and authenticate\nforensic data, track user activity on the network, and organize findings for\nuse in incident response, internal investigations, intellectual property theft\ninquiries, and civil or criminal litigation.

Cloud platforms change how data is stored and accessed. They\nremove the examiner's ability to put their hands directly on the systems. Many\nexaminers are trying to force old methods for on-premise examination onto\ncloud hosted platforms. Rather than resisting change, examiners must learn to\nembrace the new opportunities presented to them in the form of new evidence\nsources. FOR509: Enterprise Cloud Forensics and Incident Response addresses\ntoday's need to bring examiners up to speed with the rapidly changing world of\nenterprise cloud environments by uncovering the new evidence sources that only\nexist in the Cloud.\n\nCertification:\n\n    * GIAC Cloud Forensics Responder (GCFR)\n\nCourse Syllabus  Pricing & Training Options\n\n  * Cybersecurity Leadership\n\nLDR514: Security Strategic Planning, Policy, and Leadership\n\nThe next generation of security leadership must bridge the gap between\nsecurity staff and senior leadership by strategically planning how to build\nand run effective security programs. Yet, creating a security strategy,\nexecuting a plan that includes sound policy coupled with top-notch leadership\nis hard for IT and security professionals because we spend so much time\nresponding and reacting. We almost never do strategic planning until we get\npromoted to a senior position, and then we are not equipped with the skills we\nneed to run with the pack. This information security course will provide you\nwith the tools to build a cybersecurity strategic plan, an entire IT security\npolicy, and lead your teams in the execution of your plan and policy.
