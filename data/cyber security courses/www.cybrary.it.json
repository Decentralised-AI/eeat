Thanks Cybrary - 1 CPE at a time!\n\nAlex H.\n\nWe\u2019ve had six students this summer, all with different schedules, so we\u2019ve\nbeen trying to balance their learning experience with some practical work.\nIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re all sitting in a classroom at the same time, so the\nability for them to learn at their own pace without any additional support has\nprobably been the biggest benefit of using Cybrary.\n\nCollin Ricker\n\nBusiness Development Manager\n\nJust finished the third out of four MITRE ATT&CK Defender courses on\nCybrary... If anyone is interested in learning how to do ATT&CK based SOC\nassessments I would definitely recommend this course. The best part is that it\nis FREE!\n\nEric T.\n\nAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n\nExcellent new series of courses from Cybrary, each course covers a different\nCVE, demonstrates vulnerability and its mitigation.\n\nRaul C.\n\nCybersecurity Specialist\n\nI've successfully completed the career path provided by Cybrary to become a\nSOC Analyst - Level 2. Eventually, do what you love, and do it well - that's\nmuch more meaningful than any metric.\n\nWissal Ayari\n\nSOC Analyst\n\nCybrary is helping me proactively build skills and advance my career. Labs put\nconcepts immediately into practice, reinforcing the content (and saving me\ntime not having to spin up my own VM). Career paths lay everything out\nclearly, so I know what skills to prioritize.\n\nNo Name\n\nEnterprise Analyst\n\nI got a job as a cybersecurity analyst at Radware with a salary I've never\neven dreamed about AND with no prior experience.\n\nAlexei Z.\n\nCybersecurity Analyst\n\nThank you to Cybrary for providing this opportunity to complete the Cybrary\nOrientation Certification program with such sleekness and detail-oriented\nlearning.\n\nGanesh Y.\n\nSo far I have really been enjoying Cybrary's SOC Analyst Training, it has been\nvery informative. I just finished up with the command line section and now I'm\non to the more fun stuff (Malware Analysis). I think it's so dope that\nplatforms like this exist. This is a game changer.\n\nTobias Castleberry\n\nSOC Analyst, Security+ Certified\n\nI decided to check out Cybrary and the courses they had to offer after seeing\na few posts from people who had completed their courses. I'm happy to say that\ntheir instructors are knowledgeable and clear, and their course catalogues are\nextensive and offer relevant career path courses.\n\nNazli S.\n\nAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\n\nGlad to have discovered Cybrary they are such a great tool to use to help\ndiversify your knowledge through lessons, assessments and practices. All\ncompact[ed] into highly detailed and informative chunks of information.\nFeeling very content with the results.\n\nTemi B.\n\nCisco Certified Network Associate\n\nWell, it took a long time, yet I struggled hard to complete the course \"Become\na SOC Analyst - Level 2\" by Cybrary. Cybrary is the best platform that I have\never come across. Tons of virtual labs, great in-depth insights from the\nexperts, and the best career path/learning modules.\n\nMadiraju Pranay Kashyap\n\nProgrammar Analyst Trainee\n\nI am currently working in a restaurant and going to school full time.
