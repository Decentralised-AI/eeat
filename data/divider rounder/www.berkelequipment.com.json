It's a principle we built our business on. With Berkel you will\nfind simplicity, sturdiness and success at an affordable price.\n\n## BUILDING ON A CENTURY OF SERVICE\n\nIn 1898, a simple butcher named W.A. Van Berkel had a not-so-simple idea. His\nplan was to figure out a way to slice more meat for his butcher shop and\nbetter serve his customers. Armed with only innovation and determination, Van\nBerkel solved this problem and many more, making a lasting impression in the\nfood equipment industry.\n\nA SLICE OF HISTORY\n\nBack\n\n### Request a Quote\n\nIf you are looking for pricing information on a Berkel product, please fill\nout the form and a representative will contact you shortly.\n\nBack\n\n### Contact Us\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to speak with you about our products and services.\nContact our Customer Service representatives for Berkel by calling\n800-814-2028.\n\n### Berkel HQ\n\n325 W.
