For\nexample, TVs. Why is there no category easily accessible for TVs without\nhaving to search TV in the search bar? Also, there doesn't seem to be any way\nto sort items, for example by price lowest to highest. Amazon store app is\ngetting pretty useless, a master class in very poor UI design.\n\n92 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nB Garrett\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n  * Show review history\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nRufus? add a possibly helpful feature that constantly pops up covering half\nthe screen, can't be turned off and very clearly slows down every page load.\nMake it go away! Whatever occasional use I may have had for it, I'm willing to\ngo without it! Last couple weeks it freezes constantly, page jumps or reverts\nto prior searches... Super annoying!
