I Highly recommend!\n\n> My 1st order I was a little skeptical that the quality would be very good\n> because the prices are almost too good to be true! But I figured it wasn\u2019t\n> much money so if the clothes were bad quality I wasn\u2019t loosing much. Then my\n> 1st order came and I was SHOCKED! The quality was WAY better than I\n> expected! I have continued to get many things from them and never once have\n> I gotten anything of bad quality. Every order has been exactly what was\n> pictured! I ended up getting my wedding dress from them! I was on a very\n> short time frame, and couldn\u2019t get one sent from anyone but then in time. I\n> was still a bit worried cause hey, this is a dress for my wedding, not just\n> regular clothes. I payed a little (not much) extra for faster shipping and\n> it came, exactly as pictured, early and really good quality! Sense then I\n> have been hooked! I am always impressed with the quality, prices and short\n> time it takes to come! If you haven\u2019t tried them, you deff should give them\n> a shot! Another thing I like is on almost all the clothes, people leave\n> reviews at them bottom, and most of the time they will take pictures with\n> the reviews. That way you get a better idea of what the clothes look like\n> and what they look like on other people, not just models. That always is\n> helpful in helping me make a decision! I Highly recommend SHEIN and LOVE\n> this app!\n>\n> more\n\nkaayyy23  ,  12/26/2022\n\n###  absolutely obsessed\n\n> i have been buying clothes from SheIn for almost 2 yrs now and out of the\n> 75+ items i've purchased i've only ever had sizing issues once & tbh once i\n> looked back at the size chart it was totally my mistake anyway lol. i had a\n> friend take all my measurements one day and the reality of shopping with\n> exact measurements so easily visible is delightful! the quality of the\n> clothes has shocked me - i used to buy $25+ tshirts from other retailers &\n> have had better luck with SheIn's $8 shirts lasting longer and holding up\n> better in the wash ! i have IBS and my weight always fluctuates & ilove the\n> fact that this sites clothes are so affordable because i'm able to stay\n> stylish at all my weights without breaking my pockets! i recently (finally)\n> gained 15lbs after YEARS of not being able to gain weight & replaced sooooo\n> many clothes in my wardrobe with SheIn ! my bf loves them & always\n> compliments my outfits & i've even had strangers compliment them too ! my\n> fav retailer hands down !!! the ONLY thing icould complain about is their\n> return policy - they only allow you free return for your first return and\n> any return after that they will deduct about $12 from the total spent on\n> that item & give you the difference as a credit or refund. again - with the\n> accuracy of the sizing chart , i've almost never had to return anything but\n> do wish it was free returns no matter what\n>\n> more\n\nvinarris  ,  01/05/2021\n\n###  LEGIT\n\n> 100% legit site for fashionable affordable clothing. I\u2019ve been purchasing\n> for the last 2 years or more now with at least 20 + items each purchase and\n> have never been cheated or disappointed. Customer service has always been\n> above and beyond for me, they always get back to me and never had an issue\n> with returning items that didn\u2019t fit (if they\u2019re eligible for return, not\n> everything is but they tell you before checkout what isn\u2019t) my closet is\n> about 85% SHEIN clothing and shoes and the rest mall bought clothing. I\n> prefer SHEIN over anything lately. Quality is usually amazing but be sure to\n> read reviews and picture reviews before purchasing. Once I found my size in\n> SHEIN it\u2019s made shopping easier with less returns. Returns for US are free\n> (at least I\u2019ve never paid for any) so that\u2019s another plus. They\u2019re usually\n> fast with shipping but with COVID I\u2019ve been getting them like 3-4 weeks\n> later. Which is understandable given what\u2019s going on. But once things are\n> back to normal it\u2019s usually 1-2 weeks. I\u2019ve only ever had 2 packages lost in\n> the mail due to COVID which they happily replaced, no problem and sent out\n> new for me. I did eventually end up getting the first \u201clost\u201d packages\n> though. You never know until you give it a try for yourself. I\u2019m definitely\n> glad I did. They except PAYPAL which is much more comforting when you\u2019re a\n> new buyer, since they cover you. I love this app/store. 10+ stars.\n> Seriously.\n>\n> more\n\n##  Events\n\n###  HAPPENING NOW\n\nSPECIAL EVENT\n\n#SHEIN SS24\n\n##  App Privacy\n\nSee Details\n\nThe developer, ROADGET BUSINESS PTE.
