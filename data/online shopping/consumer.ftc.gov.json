Also, keep records of purchases, like receipts and emails, to make\nsure you\u2019re able to hold a seller to its promises.\n\n  * Learn About Sellers and Products\n  * Comparison Shopping\n  * Delivery, Return, and Refund Policies\n  * Pay by Credit Card When Possible\n  * Keep Records\n  * Know What Personal Information the Site or App Collects\n  * Report Problems\n\n## Learn About Sellers and Products\n\n### Read reviews with a critical eye\n\nExpert reviews from trusted websites are a good place to get information about\nwhat to buy and who to hire. Focus on sites you trust that offer impartial\nreviews from real experts.\n\nRead customer reviews about a company or product from a wide variety of review\nand retailer sites, search engines, app stores, and social media platforms.\nCheck several sources and consider where a review is posted, who wrote the\nreview, and the reviewer\u2019s history. And don\u2019t rely on star ratings alone\nbecause some reviews and ratings are fake or misleading. Fake reviews can be\npositive or negative. Not all fake positive reviews are five stars. Some\ndishonest competitors place fake negative reviews. Also, it\u2019s not always clear\nif a reviewer got something, like a free product, in exchange for writing a\nreview. Some \u2014 but not all \u2014 websites will place a label or badge next to the\nreview when they know that the reviewer got an incentive.\n\n### Find out other people\u2019s experiences\n\nSearch online for the product or company name, plus the words \u201ccomplaint\u201d or\n\u201cscam.\u201d See what other people are saying about their experience.\n\n## Comparison Shopping\n\nTo comparison shop for a product, make notes of the item\u2019s manufacturer or\nmodel number, plus details like size, color, or shipping fees. Use the\ninformation to check comparison shopping sites that list retail stores and\nonline sellers that have the item. Some sites let you sign up to get price\nalerts when prices change.\n\nNot all comparison shopping sites are the same. Sometimes manufacturers set up\nsites to promote their own products. Or some companies run sites that only\nlist or rank products if sellers pay them. Focus on comparison shopping sites\nthat are well known and trustworthy.\n\n### How to comparison shop\n\n  * Learn the total cost of the product, including shipping, handling, delivery, taxes, or other fees.\n  * Read the terms of the advertised \u201cdeal.\u201d For example, will you have to buy unwanted products to get the advertised \u201clow price\u201d?\n  * Read the entire product description, including the fine print. Words like \"refurbished,\" \"vintage,\" or \"close-out\" could mean a product is in less-than-perfect condition. If expensive brand-name items are offered for bargain prices, they could be counterfeit or stolen.\n  * See if a seller has a price-matching policy that guarantees it will match competitors\u2019 prices and match its own in-store price to its online prices. Contact a seller if you want to request a match. Some sellers match or even go lower than their own online prices or a competitor\u2019s prices.\n\nFind out if you\u2019ll be able to get a credit or refund if the item you buy today\ngoes on sale next week. What records or receipts will you need?\n\n## Delivery, Return, and Refund Policies\n\n### Read the seller\u2019s information about shipping and delivery\n\nAn FTC rule requires sellers to ship items as they promised in their ads. If a\nseller doesn\u2019t promise a time, it has to ship your order within 30 days after\nit gets your name, address, and payment, or permission to charge your account.\nMany sites offer tracking options that let you see exactly where your purchase\nis and estimate when you\u2019ll get it. If you pay by credit card but don\u2019t get\nthe item, dispute the charge.\n\n### Check the seller\u2019s refund policies\n\nThe site must say whether you\u2019re able to return the item for a full refund.\nBefore you return an item, find out\n\n  * who pays the shipping costs for returns?\n  * how many days do you have to return the item?\n  * will you have to pay restocking fees?\n\n### Check refund policies for sale items\n\nIf you buy things on sale, doublecheck the return policies. Sellers often have\ndifferent refund and return policies for sale items, especially clearance\nmerchandise.\n\n## Pay by Credit Card When Possible\n\nPaying by credit card best protects you and your money in case of a scam, or\nif something else goes wrong. Make sure the websites where you enter payment\ninformation use encryption to protect your information during your\ntransaction. Look for https at the beginning of the URL. The \u2018s\u2019 after http\nmeans the site is encrypted \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a legitimate site.\nScammers know how to encrypt sites, too.\n\nIf you pay by credit card and are charged twice for the same item, are billed\nfor merchandise you never got, or get the wrong item or a defective item,\nyou\u2019ll be able to dispute the charge. In those situations, ask your credit\ncard company to temporarily withhold payment while it investigates. To take\nadvantage of this right, call immediately and send a letter to your credit\ncard company that reaches the company within 60 days of the day the company\nmailed you the first bill showing the error.\n\n> **Never  **buy anything from online sellers that insist you can only pay\n> with gift cards, by wire transfers through companies like Western Union or\n> MoneyGram, with a payment app, or with cryptocurrency. Scammers will often\n> ask you to pay in a way that makes it hard for you to get your money back.\n> Find out what to do if you sent money to a scammer.\n\n## Keep Records\n\nWhen you buy something online, be sure to keep information about\n\n  * the company name and website\n  * what you ordered, the date you ordered it, and what you paid\n  * the seller\u2019s return policy\n  * the company\u2019s promise to ship, and the date it made the promise\n  * all email, text, and other communication you have with the company\n  * your credit card or bank account statements that show how you paid\n\n## Know What Personal Information the Site or App Collects\n\nWebsites and shopping apps often ask for personal information like your name,\nmailing address, phone number, and email. They also may collect information\nabout the things you buy, including how much you paid, along with when, where,\nand how you paid. They may sell the information to other companies, like data\nbrokers, who may combine it other personal data to develop a detailed profile\nabout you and sell it to other businesses.\n\nMany shopping apps rely on location data. For example, some apps collect\ninformation about your location to tell you whether an item is available at a\nstore near you. If you don\u2019t want the app to track your location, use your\nphone\u2019s privacy settings to control whether the app collects your location.\n\nBefore you use an app or website, also make sure you\u2019re okay with how your\ninformation is used, shared, and protected. If you\u2019re not, consider going to a\ndifferent website or look for another app.\n\nTo find out what personal information a website or an app collects, look at\nthe privacy policy, User Agreement, or Terms of Service. Look for information\nabout what the app developer will do with your data and how it will keep it\nsecure.\n\n## Report Problems\n\nIf you have a problem when you shop online, try to work it out directly with\nthe seller or site owner. If that doesn't work, tell the FTC at\nReportFraud.ftc.gov.\n\nSearch Terms\n\nonline security\n\nsaving money\n\nshopping\n\nTopics\n\nShopping and Donating\n\nShopping\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nReturn to top\n\n_ _\n\nMenu\n\n## CFG: Footer Menu\n\n  * Feature Pages\n  * Articles\n  * Consumer Alerts\n  * Videos\n\n## CFG: Footer Menu Right\n\n  * Report Fraud\n  * Get Consumer Alerts\n\n## CFG: Footer\n\n  * ftc.gov\n  * About Us\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy and Notices\n  * FOIA\n  * Office of Inspector General\n\n(link is external)\n\n(link is external)\n\n(link is external)\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore\u2026\n\n",
