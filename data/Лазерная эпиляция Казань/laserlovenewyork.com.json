I\u2019ve tried many laser hair removal places in\nBrooklyn and none are even in the stratosphere of Laser Love. The staff is\nincredibly professional and knowledgeable at what they do and the equipment\nitself was not only pain free but by far the best results I\u2019ve ever seen. I\nalso did the Hydra Facial which was not only a great experience but it gave me\na spa like feel allowing me to walk out of Laser Love completely relaxed and\nrejuvenated. I recommend this 10 out of 10 and kudos to David for creating a\nreally enjoyable experience for laser which has always been a sub par\nexperience to say the least!\n\nEli Bensoussan\n\nMaayan at Laser Love is absolutely fantastic! She provided an exceptional\nexperience during my visit. Her professionalism, attention to detail, and warm\npersonality made the entire process comfortable and enjoyable. I highly\nrecommend her services and can't thank her enough for the great care she\nprovided.\n\nVera Novomlinova\n\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n  \n\nJust had a consultation and my first session on legs and arms. I am blown away\nby the professionalism of the staff, the cleanliness of the space and overall\nquality of my experience.\n\n  \n\nThe manager Jasmine, who is friendly and very experienced in her field helped\nme with all my questions and was very informative of different options.\nMaayan, the esthetician, is great at what she does! I can tell that I\u2019m in\ngreat hands when she does my laser. Definitely the best treatment I\u2019ve had so\nfar, speaking from experience. Hoping for great results!\n\n  \n\nI appreciated that the environment at Laser Love was so positive and\nsupportive, genuinely caring to improve the quality of life of its clients.\n\n  \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to continuing my treatments at Laser Love!\n\nChani\n\nService: Laser hair removal, HydraFacial\n\n  \nSo I definitely went into my appointment thinking the whole \u201cpainless hair\nremoval\u201d thing was a myth. I mean I\u2019d been doing laser for 2 years prior and\nknow what to expect when going into a session. This process completely blew me\naway, I wasn\u2019t holding onto the table for dear life. It was actually quite\nenjoyable. It\u2019s a gradual heat unlike other machines I\u2019ve used where it feels\nlike a match strike every zap.  \n  \nI also got the hydro facial w dermaplaning and wow when I tell you I was a new\nperson leaving that appt. We did boosters and exfoliating and it\u2019s still soft\nas a baby\u2019s ass a week later.\n\nPearl Mamiye\n\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n  \n\nAmazing spa like experience!
