They have a\nbuilt in comm feature in addition to being able to play music which lets you\ntalk to other skiers using Nunchucks. The comm feature runs through a phone\napp so it\u2019s not limited by Bluetooth range. Nunchucks are the recommended\nhelmet speaker by our favorite ski helmet brand Smith.\n\nNunchucks have a titanium 40mm speaker that gives them good audio quality.\nThey have a sound mixer feature in their phone app that lets you customize the\nsound quality to your liking. They have true USB-C charging and can be charged\nin 1 hour with up to 18 hours of play time.\n\nThey are controlled by a button on each ear. You need to remember button tap\nsequences for each ear to control them. They are not quite as straight forward\nto use as other brands.\n\n**See ourreview of the Aleck Nunchucks to learn more.**\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Sound Mixer feature in the App for adjusting the sound quality\n  * Group communication mode\n  * Up to 18 hours of battery life\n  * True USB-C fast charging\n  * Good audio quality for helmet speakers\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Button tap sequences on each ear for controls can be hard to remember\n  * Turning power off always triggers Siri/Alexa since they use the same long button push\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nBackcountry evo Smith Optics Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Top Pick \u2013 Outdoor Tech Chips 3.0\n\n#### Specifications\n\n  * **Size** \u2013 0.5 inch x 2 inch diameter\n  * **Speaker Size** \u2013 40 mm\n  * **Battery Life** \u2013 13 hours\n\nCheck Price & Reviews\n\nThe **Outdoor Tech Chips 3.0** is the latest iteration of their popular Chip\nseries ski helmet speakers. When it comes to ski helmet speakers, Outdoor Tech\nis the gold standard and the far and away most popular brand. The Chips 3.0\nimprove upon the Chips 2.0 by changing to a USB-C connector for charging. You\ndon\u2019t have to fumble with an aux cable that can only plug in 1 way anymore.\nThe downside is that they do not have true USB-C circuitry for charging. You\nmust use a USB-C to USB-A cord and 5 volt source. No USB-C fast charging.\n\nThe Chips have a button on each speaker that can be used for controlling audio\nas well as activating Siri or Alexa to make phone calls or do other things on\nyour phone. They have 45mm speakers which produce decent audio quality for\ninside a ski helmet. Don\u2019t expect it to sound like a concert hall in there\nwhile you are skiing.\n\nThe Chips 3.0 use Bluetooth wireless to connect to your phone or other device\nfor playing music. They have enough battery for 13 hours of playback. Even\nwith cold temperatures reducing that, you still have enough for a full day\nskiing before charging.\n\n**See ourreview of the Outdoor Tech Chips 3.0 to learn more.**\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Thin enough to not be too noticeable in ear pads\n  * Good sound quality for helmet speakers\n  * Long battery life\n  * Easy to use buttons while wearing gloves and mittens\n  * Can use to answer phone calls\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Has a USB-C Connector but not a true USB-C charger. \n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nBackcountry Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Best Value \u2013 Outdoor Master BT01\n\n#### Specifications\n\n  * **Size** \u2013 0.78 inch x 2.0 inch diameter\n  * **Speaker Size** \u2013 40mm\n  * **Battery Life** \u2013 10 hours\n\nCheck Price & Reviews\n\nThe **Outdoor Master BT01** Bluethooth helmet headphones have up to 10 hours\nof battery life and 3 control buttons. You can easily change volume or track\nfrom the 2 buttons on the left side. The right side button can be used to\npower on and off the headphones as well as play and pause the music. They are\neasy to operate wearing gloves. They can also be used for answering phone\ncalls and giving Siri and Alexa commands.\n\nThe downside to the BT01 is how thick they are. They are a little over 3/4\ninch thick and are only comfortable to wear with a wider helmet with roomy\nearpads. The Outdoor Master Diamond MIPS is the widest and most comfortable\nhelmet for using these speakers.\n\nThey have up to 10 hours of music play and use a micro-USB connector for\ncharging which makes them hard to charge without pulling out the side with the\ncharge port. They have a power saver feature that shuts them down after 5\nminutes. I do not like this feature since 5 minutes of talking to friends on\nthe chairlift is more than enough to shut them down every lift ride.\n\n**See our fullreview of the Outdoor Master BT01 to learn more.**\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Easy to control with 3 buttons\n  * Okay but not great sound quality\n  * Long enough battery life for a day of skiing\n  * Can play music, answer calls, and work with Siri/Alexa\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Micro-USB charging connector\n  * Power saver shutdown after 5 minutes\n  * Too thick to be comfortable with some helmets\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nGet **10-20%** **OFF** with code **ERO2022** at **OUTDOOR MASTER**\n\nOutdoor Master Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Best Intercom \u2013 Cardo Packtalk Outdoor\n\n#### Specifications\n\n  * **Size** \u2013 0.4 inch x 1.6 inch diameter\n  * **Speaker Size** \u2013 40mm\n  * **Battery Life** \u2013 10 hours\n\nCheck Price & Reviews\n\nThe **Cardo Packtalk Outdoor** has an advanced intercom system in addition to\nhelmet audio system. It can network with up to 15 other Cardo devices. The\nrange can increase from 0.6 miles for 2 devices up to 5 miles with multiple\ndevices to bounce off of. The unit can be controlled with a voice recognition\nmicrophone. It can change volume, play and stop, answer calls, or talk on the\nintercom all without touching any buttons.\n\nInstallation is a little more involved than a standard set of ski helmet\nspeakers. You have to mount the 40mm JBL speakers into the ear pads. A\nmicrophone attaches to the neck strap. They give you some sticky tapes and\nvelcro pads to clean up the wiring or attach the speakers if the ear pads have\nno pockets. They also give you a 3.5mm audio adapter so you can use a set of\nearbuds for a bike helmet with no earpads.\n\nYou have to mount a control unit to the outside of your right ear pad. This\nworks great on most helmets. Some helmets have a zipper for the ear pads. The\nzipper on a Smith Vantage opens left to right so the opening with an almost\nclosed zipper is on the wrong side. The zipper on a Smith Nexus and Smith\nSurvey open right to left which works great.\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Ability to communicate with up to 15 skiers\n  * Longer range possible with networked controllers\n  * Easy to recharge with control unit on the outside of helmet\n  * Good sound quality\n  * Low profile thin speakers that are less noticeable when wearing helmet\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Some helmets have zippers on ear pads that open the opposite way needed for the end that goes to the controller.\n  * High cost\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nCardo Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. Best Wireless \u2013 Outdoor Tech Chips Ultra 2.0\n\n#### Specifications\n\n  * **Size** \u2013 0.5 inch x 2 inch diameter\n  * **Speaker Size** \u2013 40mm\n  * **Battery Life** \u2013 12 to 14 hours\n\nCheck Price & Reviews\n\nThe **Outdoor Tech Chips 2.0 Ultra** are a true wireless ski helmet speaker.\nThe 2 speakers have no wire connecting them. This makes installation easy\nsince there is no wire to feed around the back of your head between the\nspeakers. The 2.0 Ultra\u2019s come with a case that is used for charging that can\ncompletely charge them in 1.5 hours. Sound quality and speaker design is\nsimilar to the standards Chips 2.0 and 3.0. You won\u2019t mistake your helmet for\nan opera house but it sounds pretty good.\n\nThe downside to the Chips 2.0 Ultra is that you have to remove both speakers\nfrom the helmet to charge them. After charging you have to put them back in\nand hope you get the left and right in the correct side every time. The other\ndownside is the price. You have to pay $100 more to lose the wire between the\nspeakers.\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * True wireless with no connecting wire between speakers\n  * Easy to install because there is no wire to feed\n  * Easy to use 2 button controls\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * You have to remove both speakers to charge them\n  * High price\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nBackcountry Moosejaw Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 6\\.

They run off your phone or other device and will play as\nlong as that has power. They are always ready to go since they have no battery\nof their own. They come with adapters so they will work with a Lightning,\n3.5mm or USB-C connector.\n\nThe Wired Chips have the same sound quality as the wireless Chips speakers. It\nis good for something that plays inside a ski helmet. They easily get loud\nenough to play over any background noise from skiing. They are controlled with\n1 button on one speaker that does play and pause. It can also skip tracks.\nEverything else is controlled by a small FOB on the cord. You have to fish it\nout to change volume.\n\nThe downside to wired helmet speakers is the cord. You have to connect them to\nyour device with a cord running from the helmet to your jacket or backpack\nwhere you keep it. You have to remember to unhook it when you take your helmet\noff to avoid breaking any of the connections. They are about 1/3rd the price\nof the wireless Chips.\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Low cost\n  * No battery to charge\n  * Comes with 3.5mm, Lightning and USB-C adapters to work with almost any device\n  * Good volume and sound quality\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * You have to run a wire from your helmet to your phone or other device\n  * Most controls are done with a small FOB on the cord instead of buttons on the speakers\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nMoosejaw Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 7\\.

They have okay sound quality but aren\u2019t as loud as some of the\nother helmet speakers. They do have the advantage of 3 buttons for control.\nYou can use the up and down buttons on the left speaker to change volume and\nchange track without pulling out your phone. The large right button can start\nand stop and also power up and down and pair the speakers.\n\nThe biggest downside to the Alta is their thickness. The 2 button speaker is a\nlittle over 3/4 inch thick because of the ridge down the center. You need a\nhelmet with wide roomy feeling ear pads to use these.\n\nThe Alta speaker uses an older micro-USB or USB-B connector for charging. They\nhave about 10 hours of music playing time on a charge.\n\n**See ourreview of the Wildhorn Alta Helmet Speakers to learn more.**\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Easy to install\n  * 2 buttons on left ear make it easy to change volume and change tracks\n  * Can answer phones and activate Siri/Alexa\n  * IP45 water resistance rating\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Micro-USB charging connector\n  * Not the strongest for sound quality\n  * Too thick to be comfortable with some helmets\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nGet **Drift Helmet for $69.99** and more during **WILDHORN OUTFITTERS NEW YEAR\nSALE**\n\nWildhorn Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 8\\.

It lets you talk and\nlisten without needing to press any buttons. When your not using it as an\nintercom it works as a regular set of wireless helmet speakers that can play\nmusic.\n\nThe microphone connects into the side of one of the speakers. The microphone\nattaches to the chin strap on your helmet for easy talking. The connector for\nthe microphone does not have a real secure attachment to the speaker and can\neasily become disconnected. Some users add a rubber band to hold it in so it\ndoesn\u2019t bounce loose.\n\nThe Snowtalk 2 speakers are just under 3/4 inch thick. They are too thick to\nbe comfortable in a lot of ski helmets. You will feel them inside the ear pads\nwhile wearing them with any ski helmet.\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Bluetooth intercom feature with up to 710 meter range and 4 skiers\n  * Intercom doesn\u2019t require a connected phone to use\n  * Smartphone app for setup and playing music\n  * Microphone can be removed when solo skiing and just playing music\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Speakers are too thick to be comfortable in many helmets\n  * Microphone connector can easily come out of the speaker\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nAmazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 9\\.

They use a magnetic charge cord that in theory should make\nthem easy to charge. This helps with aligning the connector if you open the\nearpad pockets but don\u2019t pull the speakers out to charge them. In practice the\nmagnetic connector is sensitive and doesn\u2019t have a strong grip to the\nspeakers. You still need to pull them out to charge.\n\nThey have 40mm drivers in them which produce decent sound quality. They do not\nget as loud as other helmet speakers. If you just want some background music\nthey are fine. If you want to drown out all other sounds but your music while\nskiing these are not the choice for you.\n\nThese are easy to install since there is no wiring. The paring process is easy\nand straight forward. These are thicker than other wireless systems like the\nODT Chips 2.0. They are almost 3/4 inch thick which means that you will feel\nthem in almost any helmet you put them in. If earpad pressure gives you a\nheadache, these will be problematic.\n\n#### **What we like** d:\n\n  * Low cost for an all wireless system\n  * Can be used for music or controlling Siri\n  * Easy to install with no wires\n\n#### **What we didn\u2019t like** :\n\n  * Magnetic charge cord is finicky and easily disconnects\n  * Not as loud as other helmet speakers\n  * Too thick to be comfortable in many helmets\n\n#### See Best Deals!\n\nAmazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 10\\.

They do not have any controls on the speaker. They use a\nsimple 3.5mm connector and cord to connect your phone to the speakers. They\ncome with a 40 inch cord extension so you can detach them from your phone\nwithout digging your phone out of your pocket. You need to use your phone for\nall controls. There is no buttons or microphone built in.\n\nThey only come with a 3.5mm plug so you will need an adapter for other\nconnectors. The speakers are thin at 0.4 inches. These are a good solution if\nyou find most other helmet speakers are too thick and cause ear pain or\nheadaches. These are about as thin as it is possible to get.\n\nThey speakers have decent sound quality.

Do you want wired or\nwireless? Do you care a lot about sound quality and how loud they can play? Do\nyou want speakers that also double as an intercom or walkie talkie with your\nski friends? Let\u2019s get into what you should look for when buying ski helmet\nspeakers.\n\n#### Earbuds vs Ski Helmet Speakers\n\nEarbuds are cheap and there is a ton of options out there both wired and\nwireless. Why should you mount speakers into your helmet instead of earbuds?\nIf you are like me, you can\u2019t stand having something shoved in your ear all\nday. It\u2019s also very easy to lose a wireless earbud in a fall. Earbuds tend to\nblock out more of the surrounding noise, like other skiers, since they go into\nyour ear. Noise canceling ear buds are even worse for this.\n\nYou need to be able to hear what is going on around you while skiing. You need\nto be able to hear another yelling at you or coming very close. Helmet\nspeakers still allow you to hear all the noise you can normally hear while\nwearing a ski helmet. You just hear music added to the background. There is\nnothing stuck in your ear so they are more comfortable.\n\n#### Wired vs Wireless\n\nWired ski helmet speakers are much cheaper than wireless ones. Wireless ones\nare easier to install since there is less wires to run. You don\u2019t have to\nthink about disconnecting a wire to your phone when you take your helmet off.\nIf you\u2019re wearing wired speakers you do.\n\nWired helmet speakers that run off the power from your phone tend to be\nquieter than wireless speakers that have their own power supply. If loud is\nimportant to you, go for one of the higher end wireless designs.\n\n#### Sound Quality and Volume\n\nThere is some improvement in sound quality with the more expensive helmet\nspeakers such as Chips and Aleck Nunchucks. They use better speakers and sound\ncircuits. That isn\u2019t to say they are way way better.\n\nHelmet speakers with their own power supply/battery tend to have a louder\nrange. They have the battery and aren\u2019t dependent on the limited amount of\ncurrent available from your phone\u2019s headphone jack.\n\nA larger diameter speaker driver will tend to have better sound quality than a\nsmaller driver. 40-45mm is kind of the standard size for most helmet headphone\nspeakers.\n\n#### Speaker Size\n\nSome people get headaches from ear pressure from ski helmet ear pads pressing\nagainst their ears. I am one of them. There are very few ski helmets I can\nwear for more than a couple of hours without getting a headache. Ski helmet\nspeakers can vary from as thin as 0.4 inches to about 0.8 inches thick.\nThrowing something 0.8 inches thick into your helmet ear pads will add to the\npressure against your ears. Thin speakers are a lot less noticeable.\n\nSome ski helmets that are designed to accept ski helmet speakers have\nremovable chunks of foam in the earpad where the speakers go. I have never\nseen one more than about 1/4 thick. When you throw something 3/4 inch thick\ninto it, you\u2019re still adding 1/2 inch to the thickness of the ear pad on each\nside.\n\nSome helmets have much wider and deeper ear pads that work with thick helmet\nspeakers. The Outdoor Master Diamond is the best helmets I have tried for use\nwith thick speakers. It has very deep ear pads so you can put something thick\nin there before it pushes out far enough to feel while wearing the helmet.\n\n#### Battery Duration\n\nBattery duration can vary from as much as 18 hours down to 10 hours or less.\n10 hours is just enough to get through one ski day. It might get you through 2\ndepending on how often you turn it off. 18 hours might get you several ski\ndays on a charge.\n\n#### Controls\n\nControlling a set of ski helmet speakers can be a little challenging because\nno one wants to take off their ski gloves every time they want to pause or hit\nplay. Most wireless ski helmet speakers have 1 large button on each speaker\nwhich can be easily pressed through the helmet while wearing a thick glove.\nSome like the Wildhorn Alta and Outdoor Master BT01 have 2 buttons on one ear\nfor 3 buttons total. 2 to 3 buttons for all the controls means that you\u2019ll\nneed to use some combinations of tapping and button presses to do all the\ncommands.\n\nMost wired helmet speakers have a lot less control than wireless systems have.\nSome like the I A S U S speakers don\u2019t have any controls and you do everything\nwith your phone or listening device.\n\nSome more advanced systems like the Cardo Packtalk Outdoor can control\neverything with voice commands. It has a couple of buttons and a roller also.\n\n#### Intercom and Walkie Talkie Systems\n\nIf you want to talk to your friends while skiing, then consider getting a set\nof speakers with an intercom system. These allow Bluetooth connection between\nspeaker sets or a phone app connection. They can have range up to 1/2 mile\nwith Bluetooth connection or farther if they use your phone connection\ninstead.\n\n#### Price\n\nThere are ski and snowboard helmet speakers for as little as $25 on Amazon to\nwell over $200 for a wireless set with an intercom. If you don\u2019t care about\nwireless and you don\u2019t need to use it as an intercom you can get good sound\nfor a lot less money.\n\n## Ski Helmet Speaker FAQ\n\n#### Are ski helmet speakers worth it?\n\nSki helmet speakers come at a wide variety of prices from $25 to $250 or more.\nIf you don\u2019t like wearing earbuds and want good sound on the mountain then\nspeakers are a good option and worth the money.\n\n#### How do you put headphones in a ski helmet?\n\nYou can buy a set of ski helmet speakers that will be mounted inside of the\nhelmet. They go in pockets inside the helmet ear pads. There are options using\nvelcro and sticky pads to mount directly to the inside of the ear pad. If you\nwant to use earbuds you can just wear them under a ski helmet.\n\n#### What is an audio helmet?\n\nAn audio compatible ski helmet has ear pads designed to accept ski helmet\nspeakers. This means the ear pads will have some kind of pocket that the\nspeaker can slide into. Some helmets have removable chunks of foam to give the\nspeakers more clearance inside the ear pads.\n\n#### Can you wear headphones under a ski helmet?\n\nYes, you can wear headphones under a ski helmet. Earbuds are the easiest type\nof regular headphones to wear. You will feel the ski helmet ear pads pressing\nthe earbud into your ear. It can be easy to lose a wireless earbud when you\nfall or get bounced around too much doing something like skiing moguls.\n\n#### Can you put AirPods in ski helmet?\n\nYes, you can wear AirPods under a ski helmet. There isn\u2019t a good way to mount\nthem to the helmet since they have to go into your ear to hear them. Keep in\nmind that AirPods are small and they are also white colored. If one falls out\nof your ear while skiing, the chances are remote that you will ever find it.\n\n#### How do you listen to music on a ski helmet?\n\nThe best way to listen to music in a ski helmet is to install ski helmet\nspeakers into the helmet ear pads. This lets you hear music and also still\nhear what is happening around you. Another option is listening to earbud style\nheadphones under your helmet. Put them in your ears before putting the ski\nhelmet on.\n\n## You Might Also Like:\n\n  * The Best Ski Helmets Helpful Guide \u2013 Reviews and Ratings\n  * The Best Budget Ski Helmets Helpful Guide\n\n#### Doug Ryan  \nCo- **Founder & Chief Editor**\n\nI grew up back east in Pennsylvania and learned to ski on a family trip to\nKillington, Vermont when I was 6. I immediately fell in love with the\nmountains and outdoors and have been skiing across the US and Canada ever\nsince. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering, and have a Master\u2019s Degree\nin Material Science and Reliability.\n\nI am a total gear nerd and love learning how things work and thinking about\nhow they could be improved. Nothing excites me more than trying out new gear.\nI\u2019d rather spend 3 hours taking my bike apart and learning how to change\nsomething than go to a bike shop. These days I reside in Michigan by the Great\nLakes and go skiing, biking, and boating as much as possible.\n\ndoug@adventuregearinsider.com\n\nHi, I\u2019m Doug Ryan, founder and chief editor of Adventure Gear Insider.
