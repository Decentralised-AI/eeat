The\ncharger for the headphones I ordered wont stay connected. When I contacted\ncustomer service to do a return they said the would solve the problem as soon\nas possible and to contact them with any further questions. Since November\n19,2023 I have been completely ignored!!!! Now I am really upset with the lack\nof customer service, business ethics and professionalism. I DO NOT RECOMMEND\nORDERING ANYTHING FROM THIS WEBSITE!\n\nZero star rating.\n\n10\n\nCharles Zwirba\n\nC\n\n11/28/2023\n\n**Best BANG for the buck**\n\nI purchased these audio chips for my ski helmet and have been using them\nalmost daily for the past 2 seasons. They sound as good as I need them to\nsound, answers calls with ease, microphone seems to work loud and clear. I\ncouldn't have asked for a better set of audio chips and the low price is just\na bonus. $230 cost from the nearest competitor compared to the $79 that I paid\nfor these, I'll take that deal every time. They also come with some great\ncustomer service, I received a response to a question from them in under\n24hrs. After 2 seasons of daily use the left speaker (happened only once)\nwasn't pairing with the right speaker, after instructions from the tech\nsupport, they work perfect again.\n\n00\n\nA.B.\n\nA\n\n03/13/2023\n\n**Stopped working on third use**\n\nAfter using these headphones twice, only one will now connect at a time.\nFollowed the manufacturer advice and they still wont work. I will be returning\nthem - this seems to be a common fault.\n\n40\n\n12\n\nAbout\n\nAbout\n\n  * About Unigear\n  * Ambassador Program\n  * Affiliate Program\n  * Contact Us\n\nCustomer Service\n\nCustomer Service\n\n  * Product Register\n  * Return & Exchange\n  * Shipping Info\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms Of Service\n\nBusiness Center\n\nBusiness Center\n\n  * Become A Dealer\n  * Group-Sale Program\n  * Wholesale & Dropship\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up for exclusive offers, original stories, activism awareness, events and\nmore\n\nEnter your email\n\nsign me up\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n\n  * PayPal\n\n\u00a9 2024 Unigear Global.
