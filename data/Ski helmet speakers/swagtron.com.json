Download the Snowtide **iOS/Android app** to\nunlock advanced features including **real-time stats** **like distance,\nduration, vertical, speed, altitude and slope angle.**\n\nWhether it\u2019s trying to meet up in the lift line or knowing when it\u2019s safe to\ndrop that backcountry booter, communication is key. The Snowtide\u2019s **two-way\ngroup \u201cwalkie-talkie\u201d** feature with **one-button Push to Talk (PTT)** and\nunlimited range* makes hand-held radios obsolete.\n\nWe all fall, and if you go down hard, the Snowtide\u2019s advanced **S.O.S alert\nsystem** can call for backup. **Built-in impact sensors** will sound the\nhelmet\u2019s personal alarm letting you know it\u2019s been activated. All good? Clear\nit. But if you need help, after 60 seconds the Snowtide will automatically\nsend text and/or email alerts with your location to the emergency contact(s)\nyou\u2019ve preset in the app.\n\nAnd if you lose track of your Snowtide, a loss prevention system will sound an\nalarm on both the app and the helmet if they are separated by 50 feet.\n\nJust because we went above and beyond making the Snowtide smarter than the\naverage helmet doesn\u2019t mean we forgot the basics. Sliding vents provide\nbreathability on warm days or when you\u2019re bootpacking bonus lines. Riding in\nthe white room? Close them on-the-fly for insulation from the elements. Goggle\nguides and a strap lock keep things tidy, and front induction channels ensure\nyou can navigate with fog-free clarity.\n\nIn-mold construction combines an EPS impact layer with a durable ABS outer\nshell for multi-layer protection. A dial-fit system and adjustable, padded\nchin strap tie things together. And it\u2019s all wrapped into a sleek, aerodynamic\ndesign that\u2019s surprisingly light for all the tech we\u2019ve packed in.\n\nWhether you\u2019re lapping the park to your own personal soundtrack, scoping\nbackcountry lines with your crew or taking a call on the lift, stay protected\nand connected with the Snowtide.\n\n**Product Specifications**\n\n  * Built-in Bluetooth Audio and Mic\n  * Two-Way Group Comms\n  * iOS/Android App Enabled\n  * One-Click PTT (Push to Talk)\n  * S.O.S.
