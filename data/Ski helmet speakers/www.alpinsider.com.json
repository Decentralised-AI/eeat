Or you may want to mellow out\nand have a nice, sunny ski day. Whatever it is you're after, a pair of\nheadphones might be the missing piece you're looking for.\n\nOnce you try headphones for skiing, there is no going back. But the wrong pair\nof headphones can be uncomfortable and potentially dangerous depending on the\ntype of rider you are.\n\nIn this guide, I'll show you the nine best headphones for skiing and help you\nchoose the right pair for every ski day.\n\n## My Review Process\n\nAs a kid, I skied in groups a lot and never felt the need to have something in\nmy ears, but as I got older and my days lined up less and less with others, I\nbegan to ski alone. I found that sometimes it\u2019s nice to plug into music,\naudiobooks, or podcasts on the slopes.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the slopes and have tried many music players to\nfind the perfect fit for me. I don\u2019t always listen to something when I ski,\nbut having the option anytime I feel like I need something extra is excellent.\n\nI\u2019ve tried various ski headphones, including wireless, wired, and in-helmet\nspeakers. Here are my top picks for the best ski helmet headphones.\n\nJBL Tune Wireless In-Ear Headphones\n\nWinner\n\nBest Overall Ski Helmet Headphones\n\nView deal\n\nBose SoundSport Wireless Earbuds\n\nWinner\n\nBest Bluetooth Ski Helmet Headphones\n\nView deal\n\nWildhorn Alta Wireless Bluetooth Headphones\n\nWinner\n\nBest Wireless Ski Helmet Headphones\n\nView deal\n\n## JBL Tune Wireless In-Ear Headphones\n\n### Best Overall Ski Helmet Headphones\n\nMy Winner\n\nPros\n\n  * Bluetooth \n  * Audio Quality \n  * Comfortable \n  * Portable Charging Case \n  * Wireless Options\n\nCons\n\n  * Pricer than other options \n  * Could fall out on big crashes\n\nView Price\n\nI like my headphones to be compact, comfortable, and easy to use.

Wired headphones have an advantage because you\nnever have to worry about battery life. But ensure you have a convenient spot\nfor your device so the wires don't get in the way.\n\n## Type Of Ski Helmet Headphones\n\nThere are many different options for ski and snowboard helmet headphones.\nThere are some with better audio quality, some with a more user-friendly\nintercom system, and others with long-lasting battery life.\n\nThe following section will explain what features and qualities to look out for\nwhen buying headphones for skiing.\n\n## Ski Helmet Headphones Buying Guide\n\n### Price\n\nDepending on whether your headphones are wired, wireless, or built-in to your\nhelmet, ski headphones can have a wide price range.\n\nIf you are new to skiing and want to see if you like skiing with sounds, then\nthe cheaper models will be a great start. If you are a die-hard skier who\nloves to ski to music all day, you will want to go with a more expensive\noption as it will have more features and most likely last longer.\n\nIf you are somewhere in-between, a middle-of-the-pack sports headphone would\nbe a great pick. Just be sure to make sure the headphones you pick have the\nfeatures you want and need.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nSound quality is one of the most essential features to consider when buying a\nmusic player. It would be a shame to purchase headphones and not even be able\nto hear the music or your phone calls. Make sure the headphones you pick\nprovide a crystal-clear sound that can shine through even on the windiest\ndays.\n\n### User-Friendly\n\nBeing user-friendly is another important feature to watch out for. You don't\nwant to make all your friends wait because you are fumbling around with your\nheadphones to change the song or make a phone call.\n\nAll headphones operate differently, and it's up to you if you prefer a hands-\nfree option, glove-friendly choice with easy-to-click buttons, or a quick tap\non your helmet. Choose an option that seamlessly fits in with your ski setup.\n\n### Durability\n\nWhen choosing any piece of gear that is a bit expensive, it's nice to know\nthat the equipment will last through any weather and terrain. Make sure they\nare durable enough to survive crashes and are good for all conditions.\n\n### Safety\n\nYou don't want your headphones to be completely soundproof. When listening to\nmusic, you must also be able to hear what is happening around you to avoid\ncollisions.\n\nEnsure that your headphone wires are not in a position where they can wrap\naround your head during a fall. You also want to make sure that your\nheadphones aren't so bulky they could dig into your head and injure you during\na fall.\n\nHeadphones should have a slim design and fit easily into your ski gear, making\nthem almost unnoticeable. This will make them a more comfortable and safer\naddition to your ski day.\n\n## Summary\n\nSki helmet headphones can make communicating on the mountain effortless and\nadd a lot of fun to your day.\n\nI recommend the JBL Tune wireless in-ear speakers as the best ski helmet\nheadphones for skiing. The intercom communication system on the Sena Snowtalk\n2 makes communication of the mountain effortless. I also like the Sena\nLatitude Snow helmet with built-in headphones.\n\nView Deal\n\n## Common questions\n\nNo items found.\n\nLove the mountains?\n\nGet insider tips from expert alpinists for free.\n\nEmail\n\nNo spam.
