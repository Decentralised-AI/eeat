FX8\n\nFX8 also supports **8-person connections.** And the signal connection distance\nis also the same. The difference between them is that the FX8 has upgraded\nsignal transmission performance. The FX8 adds an outreach antenna. It can\nboost the connection **signal by 30%.**\n\nThis is definitely the best for groups. FX8 is equipped with **40MM high-\nimpedance** high-fidelity speakers and super high-definition sound quality.\n\nRegarding the sound quality of the FX8, I must praise it. You can see that its\naudio cable is a metal electric shock interface. It may look clunky, but\nthat's hard work! One of my favorite things about the FX8 is that the sound\nquality far exceeds the price.\n\nMaybe the FX8 is a bit pricey, but it's one of the best headphones out there.\nPlug my FX8 little flag on the slopes!\n\nThe FX8 ski helmet headset gives you professional hands-free communication on\nthe slopes.\n\nWith access to voice commands for IOS and Android, you can use your FX8 voice\nto control your phone. If you don't want to be interrupted by any phone calls\nwhile riding, set it to manual answer mode so you can enjoy the ride without\ninterruptions.\n\nThe FX8 is designed with a giant rotary knob, making it easy to adjust the\nvolume or set other settings while sliding.\n\nIn addition, FX8 can support up to **20 hours of calls**.

The charging time is only **3 hours.**\n\nMore importantly, the battery reminder function allows you to know the details\nof the power of the Bluetooth headset at any time.

M1S Plus\n\nM1S Plus adds 2 functions on the basis of M1S Pro, one is to **share music,**\nand the other is to **mute with one key.**\n\nWe often regretted not being able to listen to the same piece of music\ntogether when we were gliding with friends.\n\nNow comes the M1S Plus. As long as 2 people are using the M1S Plus, they can\nshare a piece of music on the slope. What a wonderfully romantic thing this\nis. Well! I admit that I am a romantic.\n\nHave you ever had a friend's external audio be too loud? If there is a\nconference call while chatting with a friend, do you want the other person to\nhear him?\n\nYou'll love the mute microphone feature. M1S Plus meets various calling needs.\nYou just need to press and hold Volume + for 2 seconds and the M1-S Plus will\nbe silent immediately.\n\nWe need some quiet moments to observe our surroundings. This is for security\nreasons.\n\nM1S Plus charging for 2~3 hours can give you **12~20 hours of talk time**.\n\nIn other respects, the M1S Plus is not much like the M1S Pro. I won't go into\ndetails here. Water resistance, number of connections, etc. are all the same.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Share music with friends\n  * Quick mute\n  * Group connection\n  * High-Fidelity Sound\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Still that question: you need to be careful about fitting the headset to the helmet.\n\n_READM1S PLUS REVIEW_\n\n## 4\\. FX8 Air\n\nThe FX8 Air is also designed with extended antennas. The connection\nperformance is also very stable.\n\nBut it only supports a two-person connection intercom. Therefore, the\nconnection distance needs to be kept within 500 meters.\n\nI think **500 meters** is enough for me. Most of the time my friends and I\ndidn't get too far, and we took off one by one and flew up the slopes.\n\nFX8 Air only allows 2 people to connect. I think this is more suitable for\ncouples.\n\nIt is also a **Bluetooth 5.0** version of the helmet intercom.\n\nThe stereo audio speakers used for the headsets are 40mm in diameter and about\n6mm thick. They provide great sounds with large amounts of amount.\n\nFodsports fx8 air usage the **CVC audio decrease** murmur and it appears it's\nworking quite well in this situation.\n\nIt has 3 audio results which are really ideal for listening to music. You can\npush the \"Function\" button to transform the sound timbre.\n\nIt's a shame it can't share music like the M1S Plus.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Bluetooth 5.0\n  * **3 kinds of Sound effects** : treble; midrange; bass\n  * Support 2-Way talk at the same time\n  * Three levels of power reminder function: full power, medium power, low power\n  * Voice Command\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Only supports 2 people and the connection distance is not long enough\n  * One year warranty\n\nBut this price is already very cheap.\n\n_READFX8 AIR REVIEW_\n\n## 5\\. FX2\n\nThe FX2 is probably our best budget. Plus the discount, it was only about\nfifty dollars.\n\nFX2 is also a **2-person connection** intercom. Just using it yourself is\ncompletely sufficient.\n\nIts connection distance is exactly the same as FX8 AIR.\n\nThe charging interface of FX2 has been updated to Type-C. The charging port is\nno longer specially made. And you can use your own fast charging cable.\n\nVersion 5.0 of Bluetooth and IP65 water resistance are old friends.\n\nWhen fully charged FX2 can listen to 15 hours of music. I love listening to\nmusic!\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Bluetooth 5.0\n  * **Type-C** interface and fast charging\n  * Best budget\n  * IP65 waterproof\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * 2 people connect\n  * The connection range is only 100 meters\n\nThe Fodsports ski helmet headphones are universally compatible with most audio\nall set ski and also snowboard helmet brand names.\n\nThese headphones provide the simplicity of use and cordless capability of\nbigger brand names at a smaller expense.\n\nIf you are trying to find top-quality ski helmet headphones without breaking\nthe bank, these earphones have every little thing you require.\n\nWireless controls and switches that are huge enough to be operated with a\nhandwear cover are preferred. The mic is readily available for making a call\nor controlling Siri with your voice. How much more could you ask for?\n\nWhen it involves top-quality ski helmet headphones that do not set you back a\nton of money, these earphones supply whatever you require in one plan.\n\n## 6\\. OutdoorMaster\n\nOne of the very best Bluetooth ski headphones, they have a built-in microphone\nthat allows for voice control, as well as answering calls without subjecting\nyour hands to the cold. Utilize its glove-friendly buttons to change volume,\nskip tracks, play, time out, as well as much more.\n\nThe OutdoorMaster Drop-In Headphones are loaded with attributes that make them\na few of the most effective performance-focused pucks around.\n\nThese have a cordless layout and are equipped with Bluetooth 5.0 technology to\ndeliver exceptional integrity. You additionally obtain great audio quality and\nalso bass response.\n\nI also such as the glove-friendly controls that this option includes. It's\nactually very easy to change the volume or take a telephone call while you're\nin winter sports.\n\nThe only downside to mention with these is that they are a little cumbersome,\nas the pucks aren't really slim.\n\nThey're ergonomic enough to suit many helmets and also permit you to listen to\nyour favorite songs for nearly 10 hrs.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Simple and easy-to-operate large buttons\n  * lower cost\n  * Uses Bluetooth 5.0\n  * Built-in microphone\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Sound high quality can be sub-par\n  * They're large and can be uncomfortable for your ears\n\n## 7\\. Unigear Bombing\n\nThis is a TWS earphone, a true wireless Bluetooth earphone. You can really say\ngoodbye to tangled, tangled headphone cables.\n\nIt is also a Bluetooth 5.0-connected headset. But it is only allowed to\nconnect your phone within 10 meters. In other words, this can only be used as\na mediocre wireless Bluetooth headset.\n\nShe only has a simple button. So you don't mess with buttons to operate it.\n\nYou can listen to 10 hours of music on a full charge. Just barely...\n\nThe waterproof level is IPX4.\n\nFor its price, it's okay as a TWS headset. It's an affordable alternative if\nyou'd prefer a fully wireless connection.\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * The true wireless headphones\n  * Bluetooth 5.0\n  * HDR AUDIO\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Just an ordinary wireless earphone with nothing new\n\n## 8\\.

Stopping from time to time on the cliff to change tracks or attend your\ncalls.

They're easily among the very\nbest cordless earphones for a ski helmet.\n\nBut it's not very cost-effective. $100 is a bit expensive.

If you're trying to find respectable\naudio but do not desire the cost connected with their Bluetooth siblings then\nthis might just be best for you.\n\nExterior technology wired chips can be connected to all sorts of Bluetooth\ngadgets. Despite the bulkier appearance, they can be connected to your old\naudio-lined skiing headgear.\n\nWhile your wires are bound to snag or come loose occasionally, it can be\nirritating or not possible for people that dislike cords.\n\nThe major benefit is that you never ever need to charge them.

The wonderful \"transparency mode\" that goes through audio from the\nenvironment; a very low profile style; no cables; several ear fit options;\nwater-resistant; high-quality audio, make/take telephone calls; as well as\n24-hour battery.
