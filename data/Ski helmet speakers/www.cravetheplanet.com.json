Runner-Up: Aleck Nunchucks\n\n**\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fRATING:  9.4/10 Stars | \u2705 Buy it!**\n\nSlip into your helmet with Aleck Nunchucks, and you\u2019re all set for an\nimmersive sound experience while shredding the slopes.\n\nBuy from Evo\n\n* * *\n\nBuy from REI\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Exceptional battery life for day-long enjoyment\n  * Seamless fit with various helmet brands\n  * Group communication feature to stay connected on the mountain\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Requires a modest cell signal for some functions\n  * May create a slight bulge in certain helmets\n  * A high-quality audio experience that might come with a premium cost\n\nStrapping on the Nunchucks, you\u2019ll notice right away the snug fit beneath your\nhelmet\u2019s liner. Their design feels nearly invisible, letting you hit the\nslopes to the soundtrack of your choice without any added bulk.

Just be aware, to\nmaintain that group connection, a cell signal is necessary \u2014 not a problem\nmost of the time, but worth noting for those remote backcountry adventures.\n\nThe Nunchucks aren\u2019t just for jamming to tunes; they\u2019re also practical.\nIntegrated controls mean you can play, pause, or take calls with your gloves\nstill on. Admittedly, they created a slight bump inside my helmet, but it\u2019s a\nsmall trade-off for such a rich audio experience. For the quality you get,\nthey could be considered an indulgence, but they\u2019re an indulgence that will\nenhance every trip down the mountain.\n\n### 4\\.

You want to make\nsure they fit comfortably and securely in your helmet. Look for headphones\nthat are designed to fit specifically with ski helmets and have adjustable ear\npads to fit different head sizes.\n\n### Sound Quality\n\nSound quality is also an important factor to consider. Look for headphones\nthat have good sound quality and are designed to block out wind and other\nexternal noise. This will allow you to enjoy your music while skiing without\nbeing distracted by outside noise.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nBattery life is another important factor to consider. Look for headphones that\nhave a long battery life so you can listen to music for an extended period of\ntime without needing to recharge.\n\nYou can extend the battery life by keeping them inside a pocket of warm\ninsulated down jacket midlayer. You may also want to consider headphones with\na quick charge feature, so you can quickly charge them up if you forget to do\nso before hitting the slopes.\n\n### Controls\n\nControls are another important factor to consider. Look for headphones that\nhave easy-to-use controls that can be operated with gloves on. This will allow\nyou to easily adjust the volume or skip tracks without having to remove your\ngloves.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nFinally, you want to make sure the headphones you choose are compatible with\nyour device.
