(Even if just to torment the neighbour with the\nwonderful smells coming out of our kitchen, that is reason enough to want to\nlearn how to make Durban Curry Powder.)\n\nlet\u2019s face it, some may like a little more ginger, some may prefer a dash more\ncardamom or fenugreek, some may prefer it a little milder or crave it more\nfiery and want to add more cayenne pepper or chilli powder.\n\nIn our quest to become currymasters, we must learn to master our own blend of\nspices so that we can prepare our own curries, according to our own tastes.\n\nThe recipe below is a good starting point, from which you can tweak and adjust\nquantities to find the perfect balance for your unique palate.\n\nI have included the steps where we roast and grind the specific seeds to make\nthe specific powdered ingredients, but it is also perfectly acceptable to use\nalready ground spices \u2013 as long as they are of high quality.\n\n**To roast and grind seeds is simple:** Place the seeds in a dry pan on a\nmoderate heat until they become aromatic. Do not let the seeds burn, lift the\npan and give it a shake to \u2018stir\u2019. Once you are happy with the roast, simply\ngrind in a spice grinder, pestle & mortar or even in a food blender.\n\nThe texture will be different with each method, but course it will add a whole\nnew dimension of flavour\n\n  * **Author:** Shane\n\n### Ingredients\n\nCopy to clipboard Copy to clipboard\n\nScale 1x2x3x\n\n  * 1 Tablespoon of ground Dhania Powder (Corriander Powder)\n  * 1/2 Tablespoon ground  Elaichi  (Cardamom)\n  * 1/2 Tablespoon of Dalchini Powder (Cinnamon)\n  * 1/2 Tablespoon  Methi (Fenugreek)\n  * 1 Tablespoon ground Jeera (Cumin)\n  * 1 Teaspoon ground cloves (teaspoon not tablespoon)\n  * 6 Tablespoons chili powder\n  * 1 Tablespoon Red Cayenne Pepper Powder (organic is best)\n  * 1/2 Adrak Powder (Ground Ginger) \n\n### Instructions\n\n  * Set out your ingredients separately\n  * Get a clean, dry, glass jar and set next to the ingredients\n  * Roast your seeds, grind into a powder.
