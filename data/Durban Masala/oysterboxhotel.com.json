Expert curry makers from Durban boast that a\ntypical Durban Masala curry powder has about 12 different ingredients in the\nblend. These include ground coriander, cinnamon, cumin, curry leaves, fennel\nseed, dried chilies and cayenne pepper, as well as ginger and garlic. The\narray of tasty Durban curries encompass many glorious dishes made from\nchicken, prawns, fish, beef and vegetables, but the most popular choice is\nlamb or mutton.\n\nOur Executive Chef at The Oyster Box, shares his signature recipe for his lamb\ncurry. If you're Vegetarian, you can substitute the meat with vegetables of\nyour choice or perhaps paneer.\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\nPreparation and cooking time: 1 hour  \nServes: 4 people\n\n  * 1kg leg of lamb or shoulder (or 1 kg chicken), cubed\n  * 75ml oil\n  * 1 onion, diced\n  * 2 cloves\n  * 2 cinnamon sticks (10 cm long)\n  * 20ml medium strength masala curry powder\n  * 1 teaspoon salt\n  * 10ml crushed garlic and ginger\n  * 4 curry leaves\n  * 5ml whole fennel seeds\n  * 250ml water (one cup)\n  * 2 large potatoes, peeled and cut in half\n  * 1 medium tomato, skinned and diced\n  * Coriander (dhania) leaves for garnishing  \n  \n\n#### Method:\n\n  1. Heat your oil and add the diced onion, cloves and cinnamon sticks.\n  2. Add the masala powder mix, stir and add meat to the pot.\n  3. Add salt, garlic and ginger, curry leaves and fennel seeds. Stir all ingredients together.\n  4. Allow to cook on a high heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking for 30 minutes.\n  5. As excess water and juices evaporate, add the additional cup of water, followed by the potato and tomato.\n  6. When both the meat and the vegetables are cooked (approximately 30 minutes), simmer on high heat for 5 minutes.\n  7. Garnish with coriander and serve with rice, roti and green salad.    \n  \n\n#### Masala curry powder mix (100g)\n\nOur curry powder mix is a carefully guarded secret but we can share what goes\nin it with you. As for the measurements - only we know!\n\n  * Cumin\n  * Coriander\n  * Fennel\n  * Turmeric\n  * Mild Masala\n  * Aniseed\n  * Cinnamon\n  * Medium Masala\n  * Cardamom\n\nFor more recipe ideas, check out our at-home blogs for inspiration.\n\n## Share your pictures\n\nIf you enjoyed the recipe, please don't forget to share your pictures with us\non Instagram, tagging @TheOysterBox\n\nFollow The Oyster Box on Instagram\n\n###  Stay in touch\n\n### Sign-up to our newsletter\n\nSubscribe to receive the latest news, announcements, and special offers\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail Address\n\nCountry\n\nLoading...\n\nSubmit\n\nWe are proud to be part of a number of select and exclusive collections and\nmemberships that share our values of outstanding service, exceptional guest\nexperiences and generous hospitality.\n\n  * Careers \n  * Legal \n  * Contact us \n  * Media \n  * Brochure \n  * Do not sell or share my personal information \n\nThe Red Carnation Hotel Collection\n\nLondon\n\n  * Hotel 41 \n  * The Milestone Hotel & Residences \n  * The Rubens at the Palace \n  * The Egerton House Hotel \n  * The Chesterfield Mayfair \n  * The Montague on the Gardens \n\nDorset\n\n  * Summer Lodge Country House Hotel & Restaurant \n\nIreland\n\n  * Ashford Castle \n  * The Lodge at Ashford Castle \n\nGuernsey\n\n  * The Old Government House Hotel & Spa \n  * The Duke of Richmond Hotel \n\nEdinburgh\n\n  * 100 Princes Street \n\nSouth Africa\n\n  * Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve & Wellness Retreat \n  * The Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa \n  * The Oyster Box \n\nBotswana\n\n  * Xigera Safari Lodge \n\nGeneva\n\n  * Hotel d'Angleterre \n\n\u00a92024 Red Carnation Hotels.
