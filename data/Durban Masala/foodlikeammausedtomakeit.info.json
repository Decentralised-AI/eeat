Family recipes\nfor this masala may vary. We grew up with mostly shop bought masala,\nparticularly Pako and Osman\u2019s Spices being Amma\u2019s two favored range of Masala.\nOn the rare occasion that she was out of masala, she ground dried chillies\nwith a mortar and pestle to make homemade chilli powder and combined it with\njeera and dhania powder or birth masala. It was my granny who loved drying\nhoards of chillies or dried onions on the lawn to make her own blend of\nspices, often knelt over the grinding stone. Having lived abroad for nearly\ntwo decades now, I have often adapted recipes to suit ingredients. I have even\nblasphemously resorted to making **chicken liver curry** with fresh chillies\nand yellow curry powder. It\u2019s about time I made my own masala! This recipe has\ncome about through trial and error over a few months now and I am finally\nsatisfied with the results, I hope you will enjoy this too!\n\n##\n\n##  What is the Difference between Chilli Powder, Curry Powder and Masala\n\nBefore I get to the recipe I would like to answer a readers question, **\u2018What\nis the difference between Curry Powder and Masala?\u2019**   Simply put, masala and\ncurry powder are both a mixture of spices. The key difference is the\ningredients and quantities used. Curry powder is less complex in its use of\nspice therefore less pungent and aromatic.\n\n**Chilli powder** is a powder form of ground whole chillies. Kashmiri chili\npowder is the most famous in Indian cuisine because of it\u2018s attractive red\ncolour. It is however less pungent or hot as  other chilli varieties and is\nused in combination with other chillies. Varieties of chili peppers used to\nmake chili powder include Aleppo, ancho, cayenne, chipotle, chile de \u00e1rbol,\njalape\u00f1o, New Mexico, pasilla, and piri piri. The use of chilli powder varies\nfrom region to region as much as it does with individual cooks. I use chilli\npowder in combination with other spices, e.g with **birth masala** to make\n**birth masala chicken soup** and with biryani spice to make **Durban masala\nbiryani**. Or in combination with jeera and dhania powder for most **meat\ncurries** like a good Durban mutton curry. Chilli powder is an ingredient in\nMasala.\n\n**Curry Powder** is a Western spice blend or British invention in the 18th\ncentury. It has a characteristic yellow colour from it\u2018s high turmeric powder\ncontent. Other ingredients include ginger, garlic and a low percentage of\nchilli peppers making a mild spice for a less tolerable palette. Curry powder\nis used to season stews or casseroles, grilled meat and a key component to\nCurry Wurst.  \n**  \nMasala **by definition is a combination of spices (from Urdu ma\u1e63\u0101la\u1e25, based on\nArabic ma\u1e63\u0101li\u1e25 \u2018ingredients, materials\u2019). Masala or masala spice  can be dried\nroasted seeds ground into a powder or paste form. Common masalas include\n**chicken tikka masala** , vindaloo masala. The latter two are a combination\nof ground whole spices with fresh onion, ginger and garlic. Durban masala is a\npowdered form. Other popular masalas include garam masala. Common ingredients\nin masala include chilli powder, fennel, cumin, coriander, cinnamon,\nfenugreek, pepper,mustard seeds, nutmeg,mace, bay leaves, star anise, cloves\nin varying proportions depending on its use.\n\n##  Why make Masala at Home\n\nIf you too are a South African expat, finding a Durban masala equivalent may\nbe more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack, depending on the\ncountry you\u2019re in, finding any spice may have been equally difficult.\nThankfully globalization has made the world a spicier place. My sudden\ninterest in spice comes from a new Indian food store in my neighborhood and\nsince reading **The Science of Spice** I have been inspired to make my own\nmasala.\n\nI sourced all ingredients for this recipe from a local Indian food store and\nrecommend using whole spices as much as possible. There are several reasons\nfor this the main being that whole spices can be roasted to release flavour\nand powdered spice may contain less desirable ingredients. One of my main\nmotivations for making my own masalas from now on is the addition of harmful\ncolorants to store bought masala, or sometimes excess salt to bulk up the\nproduct.\n\n##  What is Durban Masala Made From\n\nYet again, I stress that family recipes vary vastly. This one suits my family,\nwith a balance of sweet and fiery. If you prefer a more pungent version,\nincrease the chilli content. When I first attempted Durban Masala I ended up\nwith a rather brown looking spice, not characteristically Durban Curry. I\nadded Kashmiri chilli powder in addition to cayenne pepper to the mix, this\ngives this masala  its deep orange colour. For a fiery taste I added birds eye\nchilli.\n\nI used the following whole spices: cinnamon, cardamom, fennel, fenugreek,\ncloves, bay leaves, curry leaves, bird eye chilli and powdered ginger and\ncayenne pepper and Deggi Mirch chilli powder (available in most Asian food\nstores abroad).\n\n##  How to Make Durban Masala\n\nTo make Durban Masala roast all whole pieces on low heat. Alternately  you\ncould dry them out in the sun like my granny did, before pan roasting and\ngrinding.\n\nIn this recipe I add all whole spice in one pan. Once cool, I ground in a\nspice grinder. The result was very good I did not need to sieve the masala, it\nwas simply ready for use. Depending on the type of grinder, a sieve may be\nneeded. Any unground particles can be ground with a mortar and pestle.\n\nOnce whole spices are ground, add powdered spices. Combine and store in an\nairtight jar.\n\n##  Durban Masala Recipe\n\nSave\n\n**Yield:** 200g Durban Masala\n\nPrint\n\nWith ImageWithout Image\n\n###  Durban Masala Recipe\n\nPrep time: 10 MCook time: 10 MTotal time: 20 M\n\n###  Ingredients:\n\n  * 2 tablespoons coriander seeds\n  * 11/2 tablespoons cumin seeds\n  * 1 tablespoon cardamom seeds\n  * 1 tablespoon fennel seeds seeds\n  * 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds\n  * \u00bd teaspoon cloves\n  * 2 cinnamon sticks\n  * 5 tablespoons chilli powder (deggi mirch or kashmiri chillies)\n  * 2 tablespoons **cayenne pepper**\n  * 1 teaspoon birds eye chilli\n  * 1 teaspoon ground ginger\n  * 3 bay leaves\n  * 1 tablespoon curry leaves\n\n###  Instructions:\n\n  1.
