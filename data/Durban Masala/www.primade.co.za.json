It is one of\nmy all time favourite curries. It has no dairy in it and it is a Durban Style\nCornish chicken curry. This type of chicken takes much longer to cook as it is\na tougher meat but the wait is so worth it. I get it from my local Indian\nbutcher.\n\nCornish/ Fresh Chicken Curry\n\nWhether you call it fresh chicken, cornish chicken, hardbody or live chicken,\ni do hope you try it and love it as much as i do. It is a regular and\nfavourite dish served in many homes on a Saturday in Durban, South Africa. I\nremember the days when was a youngster\u2026. long time ago, my favourite way to\ncook it was on an open wood fire, man or man the taste is soooo damn delicious\nand if you are an Indian then you know all about munching on those bones. I\ndid not cook it on an open fire this time as it is raining here in\nJohannesburg today but I am sure that it is on the menu in many South African\nIndian homes today. Are you a lover of this chicken curry? what do you call it\nat home?
