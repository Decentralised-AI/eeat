I\nexperimented a little until I got that perfect mix. Although I didn\u2019t enjoy\nthe online store and all those goes into it. One thing I am satisfied with is\nthe fact that I got to try out new things. My **Homemade Durban Masala** did\nsell very well and everyone that purchased it told me it was amazing.\n\nRecently I chatted to the owner of a very popular chain of spice stores. I\nmust say I wasn\u2019t surprised by what he told me but disgusted nevertheless. He\ntold me that a lot of spice stores add salt to their masala mix. The reason\nthey do this is obviously to bulk up their masala and sell more. It is the\nreality of things. There are business owners that are so consumed by greed\nthat they would compromise on quality.\n\nAfter my chat I swore I am never buying masala again. I would rather take some\ntime, roast and grind my own spices. At least that way I know all my\ningredients are fresh and I know exactly what goes into it. Trust me it is not\ndifficult to make your own masala.\n\nYou can also store your masala for a month in an airtight container in a cool\nplace. If you make your masala in bulk you can freeze it for up to 6 months. I\nhave in the past stored my masala in the freezer and it I\u2019ve had no problems.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do all the work, that goes into making the masala, at once.\nYou can roast and grind the spices ahead of time. That way when you ready to\nmake your masala it doesn\u2019t become a tediuos task.\n\nI created this masala, especially, for those that struggle with adding the\nright balance of spices to their curries. This Homemade Durban Masala works\nperfectly well on it\u2019s own, without the added spices. You can however, add\nsome whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, star aniseed, black\ncardamom) for that added flavour.\n\nAs you make your own masala you can try and balance the flavours the way you\nlike it. You can add less cumin, more coriander, some crushed cloves\u2026whatever\nworks for your palate. There\u2019s no hard and fast rule in terms of making a\nmasala.\n\nHave you ever been to a spice bar and watched those aunties mix your\nmasala\u2026haha! I have never seen them measure anything. They just dump a little\nof everything into a bag and that\u2019s their art of masala making.\n\nSo please don\u2019t let those masala snobs tell you there\u2019s a fixed recipe. Some\nspice shops do have a strict recipe they use, if pre-packed, just so they can\nkeep all their masalas the same.\n\nFrom time to time I change my masala, I love adding more spices to it or\nreduce something that I don\u2019t think works anymore. Play around until you\nperfect that Masala. One day you could be selling your own mix.\n\nSome Recipes to try using this Masala:\n\n**Durban Lamb Curry**\n\n**Spicy Durban Chicken Curry**\n\n## Homemade Durban Masala\n\nHomemade masala with freshly ground spices made the Durban way\n\n5 from 3 votes\n\nPrint Recipe Pin Recipe\n\nPrep Time 30 minutes mins\n\nCourse Condiment\n\nCuisine Indian\n\n### Ingredients\n\n  \n\n  * 500 gram chilli powder \n  * 1/4 cup/25g ground cumin\n  * 1/4 cup/25g ground coriander\n  * 2 tbsp garam masala\n  * 2 tbsp ground fennel/soomph\n  * 2 tbsp turmeric\n  * 1 tspn ground cardamom\n  * 1 tspn ground cinnamon\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n\n  * Roast all your seeds separately in a pan\n\n  * Grind them individually, using a coffee grinder or a pestle and mortar\n\n  * Add all the spices to a large bowl and mix well\n\n### Notes\n\n  1.

Need to get my quantities in grams right.I have baking\ncups as measurements. You asked for 500grams chilli powder-i have 1 baking cup\n250g \u00d72 ? Also 1/4 cup in baking cup is 60ml.Can i use this for all your 1/4\ncup measurements?\n\nLorraine\n\nSunday 30th of May 2021\n\nHi Shanie! Yes you can use the 1/4 measuring cups as I use proper measuring\ncups when I say cups. In terms of grams I use a scale for that. Good luck:-)\n\nAlthea\n\nTuesday 6th of April 2021\n\nHi Lorraine. I see your recipe calls for garam masala...I'm in the Netherlands\nand trust me, I have tried just about every masala they sell here and it\ntastes different. Do you have a recipe for the masala also? Would really\nappreciate it\n\nLorraine\n\nWednesday 7th of April 2021\n\nHi Althea! The garam masala is also on my blog. Everybody has a different\nrecipe unfortunately. It's all about your own taste and preference. You can\nalways adjust the recipes according to your own needs. There is no right and\nwrong recipe in terms of spice blends and I do hope you eventually create a\nmix that works for you. However, do try my recipes on my blog and if you need\nany help feel free to message me. Take Care:-)\n\n### Welcome\n\nHello! I am Lorraine.
