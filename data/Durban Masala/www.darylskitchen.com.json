Yes that\u2019s right, a curry is my favorite. It didn\u2019t\nstart out that way though. My Dad used to make really hot Durban mutton\ncurry\u2019s. The type that would take the skin off the roof of your mouth and that\nreally put me off a curry. As I grew older though and my Dad\u2019s love of heat\nsimmered down, that is when my love of a good curry was reborn.\n\nLet me get one thing straight though, I wasn\u2019t born in Durban and I didn\u2019t\neven spend much time in Durban except for visiting my Grandparents in Margate\nabout 2 hours out from Durban. My love for curry started with my Gran and\nDad\u2019s obsession with the dish and I think it grew from there. I remember every\ntrip around Christmas time with us scouring the Indian spice shops for the\nfreshest spices and the best masala we could find so we could stock up for the\nnext year.\n\nDurban mutton curry is a very subjective topic. Everyone has their own recipe\nand this is mine. A durban curry will influence heavily on tomato and tomato\nbased products as well as a good durban masala and loads of meat and potatoes.\nThis is what goes into a bunny chow after all. Don\u2019t know what a bunny chow\nis, stay tuned!\n\nThe best condiments for curry are a cooling sambal or my mint raita. Oh and\ndon\u2019t forget the chutney\n\nPrint\n\n## Durban Mutton Curry\n\n( **14** votes, average: **4.29** out of 5)  \nLoading\u2026\n\n4.3 from 14 reviews\n\nA spicy take on the traditional curry done South African style.
