It could be the hot red curry masala spice blend that goes\ninto the pot.\n\nDurban curry masala is a spice blend you will most probably only hear about in\nSouth African curry recipes. Whether it is chicken masala, mutton masala or\njust masala, in the context of the Durban curry, it is a very hot and spicy\nblend of curry powder characterized by its red color. Furthermore, it is not\nto be confused with garam masala, although garam masala can be used as an\ningredient in curry masala.\n\nWhat we have found with curry masala is that the essential ingredient is the\nheat from cayenne or chili powder, which is what would give it the red color.\nSome people use paprika, but this would mainly be in order to achieve the\ncolor as well. Secondly, it does have a touch of sweetness to the spice,\nachieved by incorporating cardamom, cinnamon or cloves, or a combination of\nall three, which is why using garam masala as one of the ingredients makes\nsense as it gives an aromatically sweet accent to the spice.\n\nMany Durban curry enthusiasts mix up a homemade batch of curry masala and\nstore in an airtight jar for use when needed.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n  * 6 teaspoons mild chili powder\n\n  * 1 teaspoon hot pepper powder, such as cayenne\n\n  * 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n\n  * 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n\n  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom\n\n  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or a whole stick\n\n  * 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek\n\n  * 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n\n  * 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n\n## Steps to Make It\n\n  1.  Gather the ingredients. \n\nThe Spruce / Julia Hartbeck\n\n  2. Clean and dry a spice jar or glass container with a tight-fitting lid and add the mild chili powder, cayenne, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, fenugreek, ginger, and cloves. \n\nThe Spruce / Julia Hartbeck\n\n  3. Give the jar a good shake to fully combine, and store in a cool, dry place until ready to use. The mix will stay fresh for up to six months. \n\nThe Spruce / Julia Hartbeck\n\n  4. Enjoy! \n\nThe Spruce / Julia Hartbeck\n\n###  Tip\n\nGrinding your own spices before mixing them, rather than using pre-ground\nspices, will result in a more potent blend you may need to use less of.\n\n  * Herbs & Spices\n  * African Food\n  * Ingredient Information\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)  \n---  \n5 | Calories  \n0g  | Fat  \n1g  | Carbs  \n0g  | Protein  \n  \nShow Full Nutrition Label\n\n\u00d7\n\nNutrition Facts  \n---  \nServings: 16  \nAmount per serving  \nCalories | 5  \n% Daily Value*  \nTotal Fat 0g | 0%  \nSaturated Fat 0g | 0%  \nCholesterol 0mg | 0%  \nSodium 29mg | 1%  \nTotal Carbohydrate 1g | 0%  \nDietary Fiber 1g | 2%  \nTotal Sugars 0g  \nProtein 0g  \nVitamin C 0mg | 1%  \nCalcium 7mg | 1%  \nIron 0mg | 2%  \nPotassium 28mg | 1%  \n_*The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a food serving\ncontributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general\nnutrition advice._  \n  \n(Nutrition information is calculated using an ingredient database and should\nbe considered an estimate.)\n\nRecipe Tags:\n\n  * curry\n  * curry masala\n  * african\n  * weeknight\n\nRate This Recipe\n\nI don't like this at all.
