From a legal standpoint, negligence refers to a failure\nto exercise due care.\n\nThere are many situations where you might owe someone else a duty of care. For\nexample, if you are driving a car on a public road, you must watch out for\nother motorists, pedestrians, or bicyclists.\n\nTo prove that someone else acted carelessly and caused your injury, you need\nto demonstrate that:\n\n  * The defendant had a duty to the plaintiff\n  * The defendant breached the duty\n  * The breach directly caused the accident that wounded the plaintiff\n  * The plaintiff suffered an actual, documentable injury\n\nA hardworking attorney in Wausau could strengthen your personal injury claim\nby helping show that a defendant hurt you by failing to exercise due care.\n\n## What Damages do People Collect in Personal Injury Cases?\n\nCompensation in personal injury cases aims to award people money for the harm\nthey experienced due to a defendant\u2019s carelessness. Common issues covered by\nmonetary damages include medical expenses, lost time at work, and appointments\nwith a doctor. Financial compensation could also provide payments for more\nsubjective factors like emotional distress, physical pain, scarring,\ndisability, or reduced enjoyment of daily life.\n\nIn some instances, you might also become entitled to collect punitive damages,\nwhich are additional payments that intend to punish a defendant for extremely\nreckless behavior. For instance, if a motorist drove their car while under the\ninfluence of drugs or alcohol and hit you, punitive damages might apply.\n\nMeanwhile, you might collect less compensation if you are partially\nresponsible for your own injuries. For instance, Wisconsin Statute \u00a7895.045\nstates that you need to pay damages equal to the level of blame you face for\nan accident.\n\nA diligent attorney in Wausau could help you determine the extent of financial\ncompensation you deserve in your personal injury case or fight against someone\nwho claims you are partially to blame.\n\nTeam\n\n## Meet The Bremer & Trollop Team\n\nLance R.
