Bower allegedly drove drunk and hit three pedestrians at about 11\np.m. on August 6th, following the Brat Days festival.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Bower was leaving Brat Days when her car\nstruck three women, who were walking in a marked crosswalk on North 17th\nStreet at Niagara Avenue.\n\n# Auto Accident Lawyer in Wausau: Commentary\n\nAt the personal injury law firm of Eaton John Overbey Jackman, we have seen\nfirst-hand the devastating effects of driving under the influence of alcohol\nor drugs.  We recently represented a young man injured in an auto accident\ncaused by a driver who had been smoking marijuana.  Our client, who was 19 at\nthe time, suffered permanent brain injuries.  Though the driver was uninsured,\nwe were able to obtain a policy-limits settlement from the insurance company\ncovering the auto dealer who sold the car to the teen driver.  If you or\nsomeone you love has been injured by an impaired driver, call us at\n715.843.6700 to make sure your rights are protected.\n\nBower admitted she had been drinking before going to the festival. She told\npolice she panicked and drove off, then abandoned her vehicle a few blocks\naway from where the crash occurred and ran home, where a police officer was\nwaiting for her.\n\nOne victim, 60-year-old Barbara J. Janke, of Sheboygan, died of her injuries\ntwo days later. Janke\u2019s daughter, Marissa C. Mallman, 19, and a friend Katrina\nN. Lulow, 19, who is five months pregnant, were also injured. Both have been\nreleased from the hospital.\n\nMallman told police she and the other women had checked for traffic several\ntimes before attempting to cross North 17th Street and did not see any\nvehicles approaching. Witnesses told police they saw a vehicle (apparently\nBower\u2019s) traveling on 17th Street with no headlights on and then saw two\nbodies fly over the top of the vehicle. They said the vehicle never slowed\ndown.\n\nBower was charged with three felony counts of hit and run, with separate\ncharges for causing great bodily harm, injury and death; two felony counts of\nintoxicated use of a vehicle, with separate charges for causing injury and\nhomicide; and one misdemeanor count of operating while intoxicated, causing\ninjury. If convicted, Bower could be sentenced to nearly 50 years in prison.\n\n\n\n## Auto Accident Lawyer in Wausau: Contact Info\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, contact an **auto\naccident lawyer in Wausau** at our office for a free consultation.
