The terms of that policy may limit the compensation you can receive for your accident. For example, many Wausau drivers carry only minimum liability insurance. Other parties, on the other hand, frequently carry higher-value policies that can provide additional compensation for the injuries you suffered.\n\n  * **How much did your medical bills cost?  **Often, the insurance company will base the compensation you receive from your accident on the amount of your medical bills. Severe injuries, like spinal cord injuries and amputations, can lead to substantial, often ongoing medical expenses. More minor injuries like broken bones may carry a hefty initial price tag, but may not cost as much in the long run.\n  * **How much time did you miss at work?  **For many victims of Wausau accidents, lost wages can cause just as much financial devastation as increasing medical expenses. You may have to miss work, not just in the immediate aftermath of your accident, but as you attend follow-up appointments or go to physical therapy.\n\nSome injuries may limit your ability to perform your usual job duties. You may\nneed to drop to part-time work temporarily, work from home on a limited basis,\nor change your hours to reflect your new limitations. Worse, some injuries can\ncause permanent disability that makes it impossible for you to return to work.\n\nYour attorney will help evaluate these key categories and help you determine\nhow much compensation you should expect. An attorney cannot provide you with a\npromise about how much compensation you will ultimately receive, but can give\nyou a better idea of how much compensation to expect in a personal injury\nclaim.\n\nAn attorney can also help you determine how to add in pain and suffering\nexperienced as a result of your injuries, including both physical pain and\nemotional anguish related to your accident.\n\n## Wausau Personal Injury FAQ\n\nIf you have questions that pertain to your individual personal injury claim,\ncontact our experienced Wausau personal injury attorneys as soon as possible\nto learn more. On the other hand, if you still want to get a better idea of\nwhat a personal injury claim might look like, take a look at the frequently\nasked questions below.\n\n### Can I file more than one Wausau personal injury claim for the same\naccident?\n\nIn general, you can file only a single personal injury claim against the party\nthat caused your accident. However, if more than one party contributed to your\naccident, you can file a claim against each liable party.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you suffered injuries in a car accident with a\npizza delivery driver on a snowy day. Most local businesses closed down, but\nthe restaurant chose to stay open. On investigation, your attorney discovers\nthat the driver\u2019s manager pressured him heavily to come into work, even\nthreatening him with the loss of his job if he failed to come in despite the\nbad weather.\n\nWhile the pizza delivery driver in that scenario bears liability for his\nactions behind the wheel, including the actions that led to the accident, the\nrestaurant may also bear liability for the accident. An attorney can help you\ndetermine how to file a claim and who bears the majority of the liability for\nthe accident.\n\n### Who pays my medical bills while I manage a Wausau personal injury claim?\n\nThe party that caused your accident may bear liability for many of your\nmedical bills, but will not have to pay your medical care providers directly.\nInstead, the liable party, or that party\u2019s insurance company, will issue a\npayment to you. You can then use the funds from your settlement or award to\ntake care of your medical bills.\n\nIn the meantime, you can use your medical insurance to cover many of the\nexpenses associated with your personal injury claim. Medical insurance can\nalso prove vital in paying for your long-term medical expenses following\nsevere injuries.\n\n### The liable party\u2019s insurance company called me. Do I have to talk to them?\n\nYou may, at some point, need to make a statement about the events that led to\nthe accident. However, you should talk to an experienced personal injury\nattorney before talking to the insurance company, if possible. In many cases,\nthe insurance company will try to limit the compensation it has to offer for\nyour injuries by providing you with a low initial settlement offer.\n\nIf you accept that offer, the insurance company need no longer make any\nfurther payment to you, which means you may not get the funds you really need\nfor your personal injury claim.\n\n###  I did not realize I suffered serious injuries immediately after the\naccident, but rather discovered them later. Can I still file a Wausau personal\ninjury claim?\n\nYes. You have the right to file a personal injury claim any time another\nparty\u2019s actions cause severe injuries, even if you did not realize the full\nextent of your injuries immediately after your accident. However, it can prove\nmore difficult to show exactly when your injuries occurred if you do not seek\nmedical attention immediately after the accident.\n\nThe insurance company or the representatives of the liable party may try to\nprove that your injuries occurred at another time or that you did not suffer\nsuch severe injuries during the accident itself. Talk to an attorney to learn\nmore about how to proceed with your claim when serious injuries crop up well\nafter the initial accident.\n\n### Someone committed an act of negligence that could have resulted in serious\ninjuries, but I escaped with only minor injuries: a few bumps and scrapes. Do\nI still have grounds for a Wausau personal injury claim?\n\nIn some cases, you may note a severe act of negligence on the part of someone\nwho bears a duty of care to you, but escape with relatively minor injuries.\nSuppose, for example, that you notice a wet floor, but walk around it instead\nof slipping and falling. While the institution may have violated its duty of\ncare to you, you may not have grounds for a personal injury claim because you\ndid not suffer injury. Likewise, if you notice a speeding driver, but suffer\nno injury due to that driver\u2019s actions, you cannot file a personal injury\nclaim.\n\nIn some cases, you may, however, suffer severe property damage due to that\nnegligence, even if you do not personally suffer serious injuries. You may,\ntherefore, have grounds for a property damage claim, even if you did not\nsuffer injury personally.\n\n### Will I have to go to court over my Wausau personal injury claim?\n\nThe majority of personal injury claims settle out of court. Going to court\noften substantially increases the cost associated with the claim for both\nsides, and most often, the insurance company will try to settle out of court\nif possible. Sometimes, however, you may have to take your claim to court to\nreceive the full compensation you deserve.\n\nMost often, personal injury claims go to court if you have to ask for a large\nsettlement or award due to the extent of your injuries, or if liability gets\ncalled into question and you need to prove exactly how your accident occurred.\n\nHaving an experienced Wausau personal injury attorney on your side can prove\nvital if you have to take your claim to court. An attorney can present a\ncompelling case for you, build evidence against the liable party, and help\nfight on your behalf.\n\n### What should I do if I suffer severe injuries due to someone else\u2019s\nnegligence?\n\nThe steps you take immediately after a serious accident can help protect you\nand your finances. First, make medical attention your top priority. A doctor\u2019s\nexam can help you fully understand the injuries you suffered and increase the\nodds that you will make a full recovery. Many injuries may worsen quickly if\nnot treated.\n\nNext, make sure you report the accident. In a car accident, that might mean\nfiling a report with the police. If you suffer an injury at work, that may\nmean going through the system put in place by your employer. Finally, make\nsure you contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible. An attorney\ncan help guide you through your personal injury claim and keep your rights at\nthe forefront as you seek compensation.\n\n## Call Our Wausau Personal Injury Attorneys Today\n\n<iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lee9XlR-\nCjA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-\nwrite; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\nreferrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Wausau\n| Wisconsin Personal Injury Lawyers | Nicolet Law Office\"></iframe>\n\n __\n\nWith 20 team members in nine locations throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota, the\nWausau personal injury lawyers at Nicolet Law Office strive to be more than\njust legal professionals in the communities we serve.
