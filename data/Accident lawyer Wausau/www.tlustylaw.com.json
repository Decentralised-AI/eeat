Jessica was very kind throughout\n> the whole process and made sure that I understood everything before moving\n> forward. She always gave a reply within hours of me reaching out and never\n> left me in the dark with where my case was headed and it\u2019s status. My\n> accident was November of 2020. It is now October of 2021 and we settled two\n> days ago. She was even able to get me almost double what the other insurance\n> wanted to pay out. If you\u2019re looking for reliability and success Jessica is\n> the way to go!\n\nDesiree\n\n> I contacted Jessica after I was involved in a canine incident. I felt very\n> comfortable with her right away. Her and her team were very responsive with\n> my questions and concerns, and guided me on steps to take. When it came to\n> settlement time she fought for me to increase my settlement. I would\n> definitely recommend her services.\n\nJenna\n\n> When you contacted me, after I inquired in regard to the suit, I must say I\n> was totally surprised by you. You were very willing to explain everything in\n> detail \u2014 what you were, what I would do and the results. And I must say only\n> two words \u2014 thank you. What a patient and just plain nice group of people I\n> dealt with.\n\n> Jessica truly cared about the outcome of my case. She kept me informed and\n> in touch with what was going on. She was firm with the insurance company(s)\n> when negotiating settlement. Jessica worked hard for me, got me a great\n> settlement, and charged less than most attorneys.\n\nRose\n\n> The injury to my back was not only painful but stressful. Tlusty, Kennedy\n> and Glascock, S.C. handled everything very professionally and efficiently.\n> They made sure all of the bases were covered and it cost me nothing unless\n> they were successful. They secured some financial stability for me and my\n> family during a rough time.\n\n> Someone is always available to take a call and answer your question or\n> return a call. Attorneys and staff are sympathetic and understanding.\n\n> My child was in an car accident and heard about Jessica from a friend.\n> Everything she told me about her was what I needed to hear to make the move\n> to hire her for the case. Jessica and her team did a great job and handle\n> everything. Knowing that I was in good hands made me feel less overwhelmed.\n> Thank you, Jessica for all your hard work!\n\nBrooke\n\n> When I knew I needed legal advice, I had no doubt who to call. Jessica\n> provided not only great legal advice, but compassion for my case. She was\n> professional and made sure I understood my legal rights, taking time to\n> explain the entire process.
