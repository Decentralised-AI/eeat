TBI is not caused by something internal such as a stroke or brain\ntumor and it is possible to have a TBI and never lose consciousness.\n\n  \n\nCommon criteria created by the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) to identify the\npresence and severity of TBI include:\n\n  \n\n **Damage to brain tissue caused by an external force and at least one of the\nfollowing:**\n\n  * A documented loss of consciousness\n  * Unable to recall the actual traumatic event (amnesia)\n  * Has a skull fracture, post-traumatic seizure, or an abnormal brain scan due to the trauma\n\n## Traumatic Brain Injury Attorney in Wausau, Wisconsin\n\n* * *\n\nVictims of traumatic brain injury in Wausau can count on the attorneys and\nstaff at our Milwaukee and Madison office to represent them.

Rozek Law Offices has created this downloadable Traumatic Brain\nInjury Symptom Checklist for Wisconsin TBI victims.\n\n  \n\nThe doctor will ask you questions about the injury. He or she may ask\nquestions that test your ability to pay attention, learn, remember, and solve\nproblems. The doctor will check for physical signs of a brain injury by\nchecking your reflexes, strength, balance, coordination, and sensation. The\ndoctor may order imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI to make sure that\nyour brain isn\u2019t bruised or bleeding. You may need tests to see if your brain\nis working as it should.\n\n## Attorney Randy Rozek\u2019s Experience\n\n* * *\n\nAt our Milwaukee, Wi location, veteran personal injury attorney Randall Rozek\nserves on the Board of the Traumatic Brain Injury Litigation Group of the\nAmerican Association for Justice and is the editor of the Journal of Traumatic\nBrain Injury Litigation. A member of the Brain Injury Association of America,\nRozek also speaks to lawyers and doctors in order to educate them on such\nissues, particularly in the area of representing victims of Traumatic Brain\nInjury. In May of 2016, a jury returned a $7.25 million verdict in a difficult\nbicycle vs. pickup truck collision after only 3 days of trial. The award was\nbased on Rozek\u2019s success at excluding certain damaging evidence and overcoming\nunfavorable testimony from the defendant, investigating police officer and an\nindependent witness. In his closing, Rozek asked for $5.25 million, but the\njury recognized the severity of his client\u2019s injury and instead awarded $7.25\nmillion.\n\n##\n\nRequest Your Free eBook\n\n* * *\n\n##### Our office has provided information regarding the different types of\nWisconsin Personal Injury Accidents that we have experience handling.\n\n### **Wisconsin Accidents**\n\n  * Accident Type\n    * Airplane Crash\n    * Bicycle Accident\n    * Bus Accident\n    * Car Accident\n    * Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\n    * Construction Site Accident\n    * Dog Bite\n    * Drunk Driving Accident\n    * Gas Explosion\n    * Motorcycle Accident\n    * Truck Accident\n    * Rideshare Accident Lawyer\n    * Nursing Home Neglect\n    * Pedestrian Accident\n    * Product Liability Accident\n    * Slip and Fall Accidents\n\n### **Wisconsin Personal Injuries**\n\n  * Injury Type\n    * Brain Injury\n      * Physical Symptoms\n      * Behavioral Symptoms\n      * Cognitive Symptoms\n      * Sleep Disturbance\n    * Body Injuries\n      * Ankle Injury\n      * Arm Injury\n      * Back Injury\n      * Brachial Plexus Injury\n      * Clavicle Injury - Collarbone Injury\n      * Elbow Injury\n      * Foot Injury\n      * Hand Injury\n      * Hip Injury\n      * Knee Injury\n      * Rib Injury\n      * Shoulder Injury\n      * Spinal Cord Injury\n      * Sternum Injury\n      * Vestibular Disorders\n      * Wrist Injury\n    * Post Traumatic Migraine\n    * Post Traumatic Headache\n    * Neck Whiplash Injury\n    * Orthopedic Injury\n    * RSD-CRPS\n\n### **Ready to get started?**\n\n####\n\nCall us at 414-374-4444\n\nCONTACT US\n\n**Main Office Location**\n\nRozek Law Offices, SC\n\n3970 N Oakland Ave Ste 604\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin 53211\n\n(414) 374-4444\n\n**Additional Client Meeting Location**\n\nRozek Law Offices - Madison\n\n2810 Crossroads Dr Ste 4046\n\nMadison, Wisconsin 53718\n\n(608) 208-1147\n\n####\n\nRecent Blog Posts\n\n###  $8.3 Million Verdict in a Negligent Security Case for TBI and PTSD\n\nBy Randy Rozek \u2022 27 Oct, 2023\n\nAfter an ongoing struggle to bring justice to the victim of an attack at a\nWisconsin diabetes clinic, attorney Randy Rozek of Rozek Law Offices, S.C. has\nwon an $8.3 million victory in which a jury found hospital security at fault\nfor the attack and the client\u2019s resulting injuries. In 2014, Rozek\u2019s client\nwas in the waiting room of the diabetes clinic at a local children\u2019s hospital\nwhen a 16-year-old girl with a history of violence viciously assaulted her.\nThe victim, who was accompanied by her two young children, was \u201cpunched\nrepeatedly in the face and head, had chunks of hair pulled from her head and\nwas struck in the head with a chair,\u201d Rozek said. The children, aged 9 and 11\nat the time, were so frightened by the brutal beating that they fled to a\nstairwell for safety, fearing their mother had been killed by the attacker and\nthat they would be next if the attacker was to find them. Rozek\u2019s client\nsurvived the assault, but still struggles with symptoms of a TBI (traumatic\nbrain injury) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) following the attack.\n\n###  Randy Rozek Elected Chair of the Traumatic Brain Injury Litigation Group\n\nBy Jayne Zabrowski \u2022 21 Jul, 2020\n\nCongratulations to Attorney Randy Rozek on his election to be Chair of the\nAmerican Association for Justice\u2019s Traumatic Brain Injury Litigation Group.\nThe American Association for Justice (AAJ) is the largest group of legal\nadvocates for justice in the country. According to AAJ: \u201cFor over 70 years,\nAAJ has successfully defended Americans\u2019 right to trial by jury and continues\nto fight every day to protect our practices, our clients\u2019 rights, and our\ncivil justice system.\u201d The 3 pillars of AAJ are Community, Advocacy and\nEducation. AAJ has over 50,000 members and has several different Litigation\nGroups made up of attorneys that specialize in different areas of the law. The\nTraumatic Brain Injury Litigation Group (TBILG) was established in 1991 in\norder to allow attorneys that handle Traumatic Brain Injury cases the ability\nto share their knowledge, techniques and experience. The TBILG has over 300\nmembers from around the world. Pre-COVID19, the TBILG will typically put on\ntwo or three in-person conferences throughout the year and always had a\nreputation for bringing in great speakers and having a great turnout. Randy\nwas asked about his election as Chair of the TBILG and had this to say: \u201cIt\nmeans a lot to me that my fellow trial lawyer colleagues bestowed upon my the\ngreat honor of leading the Traumatic Brain Injury Litigation Group for the\nnext year. Our group is made up of some of the greatest TBI lawyers in the\ncountry, if not the world. I am proud to lead a group of great lawyers that\nhave dedicated their practices to advocate for those individuals that have\nsuffered from the devastating effects of brain injuries.\u201d Rozek Law Offices,\nS.C. 3970 N Oakland Ave Ste 604 Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53211 (414) 374-4444\nhttps://www.rozeklaw.com/\n\n###  Rozek Law Offices Implements New Coronavirus Procedures\n\nBy Randy Rozek \u2022 18 Mar, 2020\n\nThe vast majority of interactions between clients and Rozek Law Offices is not\nin-person contact.
