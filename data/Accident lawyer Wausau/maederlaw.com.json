Get the firepower of our legal team on your side.\n\n## worker's compensation\n\nWork injuries have a major impact on our lives and the ability to provide for\nour families. This area of the law is confusing and the insurance company is\nnot going to look out for your best interest. Lost wages, medical expenses,\nand worries over the future are difficult problems that you do not want to\nface alone. We have successfully handled thousands of work injury claims and\nwe are ready to help you.\n\n## dog bites\n\nWisconsin\u2019s law of \u2018strict liability\u2019 for dog bites is not as straightforward\nas it seems. It burdens the responisibility of \u2018contributotry negligence\u2019 on\nthe injured person.\n\n## Slip, Trip, or Fall Down Accidents\n\nSlip, trip, and fall down accidents are some of the most difficult cases to\nhandle.

The Maeder Legal Team routinely\nhandles these cases and we are successful in recovering for our clients.\n\n## Motorcycle Accidents\n\nWe are riders and we know the risks. At the Firm we have a saying \u201cMotorcycle\nriders should have equal rights on the highway, the Maeder Legal Team makes\nsure they have equal rights in the courtroom.\u201d\n\n## Other Negligent Claims\n\nThese claims are all based on poor design or defective manufacturing. We hold\nthe manufacturers, distributors, and dealers of these products responsible for\nany damages they may have caused.\n\n## Shaping Wisconsin Law\n\nOne way to objectively measure a law firm\u2019s actual trial experience is to\ncheck the number of appellate decisions it has been involved in over the\nyears.\n\n## Construction Site Accidents\n\nInjuries that occur on construction sites are often complex and can involve\nnumerous contractors, who may all bear a share of the blame. Our firm has\nsuccessfully handled many local construction site accident cases.\n\n## Farm Accidents\n\nFarming is a way of life in Wisconsin. Each year there are numerous hard-\nworking people who are significantly injured and even killed in farming\naccidents. We will help get you the compensation you are entitled to from\ninjuries caused by a farm accident.\n\n## Boating Accidents\n\nWe all love spending time on the water, but this activity can also be\ndangerous if boaters do not follow safety guidelines. We know the laws\ngoverning water-related recreational activities and we will make sure you get\nfully compensated for your claim.\n\n## Snowmobile/ATV Accidents\n\nSome of the same rules of the road that apply to motor vehicles also apply to\nthe use of these trails. Injuries can occur when the rules are not followed.\nIf you are injured in such an accident, you are entitled to compensation.\n\n## Brain Injuries\n\nThe devastating impact of head injuries have made headlines in recent years.\nHowever, it is not just those in athletics or the military who are affected,\nbut anybody who has sustained head trauma can have tremendous life-altering\nconsequences.
