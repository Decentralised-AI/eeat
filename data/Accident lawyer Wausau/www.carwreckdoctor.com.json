Thankfully, many of these injuries, such as cuts and bruises, are\ninsignificant. However, just because the physical ramifications of your\naccident may appear minor does not mean they are.\n\nThe prime duty of an experienced car accident lawyer is to help accident\nvictims pay for your injuries and property damage by holding the insurance\ncompany of the at-fault party responsible in Wausau. So before discussing the\nfiner points of car wreck legal representation for insurance claims, let us\nexplore the physical aspects accompanying an injury.\n\nFor some injuries, such as whiplash, it may take hours or even days for\nsymptoms to occur. You could walk away from the accident feeling completely\nfine and wake up the following day in tremendous pain. The only way to detect\nit early is to see a healthcare provider trained to observe the telltale signs\nearly on.\n\n\n\n### Whiplash\n\nWhiplash is one of the most common car accident injuries one can sustain, even\nin Wausau. Simply put, it occurs when the neck is thrust quickly forward and\nbackward rapidly. It gets its name because the option resembles the cracking\nof a whip, and even though it is most frequently associated with car\naccidents, that is not always the case. Whiplash can occur for a variety of\ndifferent reasons.\n\nThe physical symptoms of whiplash vary, but it generally involves soreness,\nstiffness, and back pain, but it can spread to your shoulders.\n\nWhat makes whiplash so particularly tricky is that it takes time to notice. It\ntakes hours or even days sometimes for accident victims to begin feeling pain.\nYou should visit a local Wausau medical care professional immediately after an\naccident to keep the condition from worsening.\n\n\n\n### Neck and Back Pain\n\nApart from whiplash, generalized neck and back pain can also occur, sometimes\nimmediately after the accident. Although, like whiplash, it could take time to\ndevelop as well.\n\nYou may have pain in one specific area or all across your neck and back.\nRegardless of how the pain has manifested, our Wausau licensed medical\nprofessional needs to treat it as soon as possible.\n\nBack pain can be a significant inhibitor to your daily quality of life. It\ncould make simple tasks such as driving, walking, or even sitting down to\ndinner a painful experience.\n\n\n\n### Inflammation\n\nBelieve it or not, inflammation is a prevalent condition after a car accident.\n\nIt is a natural occurrence not exclusive to trauma caused by a car accident.\nWhen a body is injured, the natural response is to inflame the area so blood\nflow can increase and remove damaged tissue to heal best.\n\nInflammation can often be observed by watching the swelling in the body, which\nregrettably can be pretty painful. It may also cause you to feel worse than it\nis until the swelling and inflammation decrease.\n\n### Herniated Disk\n\nA slipped disk is a potentially excruciating condition resulting from a car\naccident.\n\nOtherwise known as a ruptured disk, it can cause interior leakages, weakness,\ndamage to other nerves, numbness, and pain.\n\nThe disk has a soft squishy center and a rugged exterior, rupturing when it is\nforcibly pushed out of place.\n\nSometimes they can heal themselves, but some get even worse as time goes by.\nThat is why you should always be careful and contact a medical professional to\ntake care of them.\n\nThese are only a few of the most common forms of auto accident injuries. Other\nconditions such as traumatic brain injury, paralysis, or even death can also\noccur.\n\n##  \n\n## How Do You Know if You Need a Personal Injury Law Firm in Wausau?\n\nFor most people, this is the hardest part of their recovery journey, and a lot\nof consideration needs to go into determining whether you need an experienced\nattorney to cover your case. Questions such as how bad are your injuries, who\nwas at fault, and how much effort are you willing to spare to get the\ncompensation you need?\n\nA good rule to live by is that if your injuries are worse than just some\nsuperficial damage, such as scrapes, cuts, or bruises, you should have an\nattorney lined up to help you prove your injuries so you will not be cheated\nout of the compensation you deserved.\n\nTo put it bluntly, if you were at fault for the accident as determined by the\nWausau authorities and the insurance companies, you can not expect to receive\ncompensation. However, if you are the injured party whose condition was caused\nby the negligence of a third party, then yes. Not only should you not be\npaying for your property damage, but you should also be fighting for your\nright to compensation.\n\nBeing in an accident is stressful, and whether or not you want to pay a\nsignificant amount of attention, you will have to. It is a stressful,\nemotional, and anxious time. Then add on the additional burden of determining\nwho is actually at fault and then mounting an attack for trying to get those\nresponsible for paying for it. Why not take off some of that additional stress\nby bringing on an experienced car accident lawyer whose job is to fight for\nyour right to compensation?\n\n\n\n## What Exactly Does a Good Wausau Auto Accident Attorney Do For You?\n\nBefore you even reach out to your insurance company following your car\naccident, it is recommended that you reach out to your auto accident attorneys\nfirst.\n\nYou should call your lawyer first because they will help you handle everything\nyou have been through, including the losses sustained. It will be an\nadditional shoulder offered to help you carry the burden of this most\nunfortunate occurrence.\n\nThey will also give you further support for dealing with your insurance\nclaims. Even though the insurance company is there to help you, they are still\na business, and businesses do not like to give money or resources away.\nInsurance companies have been known to use even simple and seemingly innocent\nphrases such as \"I'll be okay\" against you to deny your claim. It is when\ndealing with such tricky organizations that it's good to have an expert in the\nfield on your side.\n\nA few of the losses you may have experienced after your accident are damage to\nyour person, damages to your car, lost wages if work is missed, emotional\ndistress, disability, PTSD, wrongful death, pain, and other non-economic\ndamages. An experienced personal injury attorney in Wausau will be able to\nhelp determine the extent of your damage and help you determine how much money\nyou are owed from the liable parties. They will know the ins and outs of these\nconditions through their many years of experience and help you get the best\nfigure possible, which is surprisingly tricky to determine for yourself.\n\n## What is a Car Accident Injury Referral?\n\nA Car Accident injury referral is one of the various services we offer at Car\nWreck Doctor in Wausau. Our business is ensuring your needs are met after\nbeing injured in a car accident.

We have spent years making relationships\nwith the best chiropractors, doctors, and lawyers in your area so that when a\ncatastrophic injury happens, we can point them in the right direction to\nensure they get the care needed for their physical injuries.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that if you choose to go with the auto\naccident lawyer we refer, they often work with a contingency fee basis. A\ncontingency fee is usually a blessing for clients they work with. All a\ncontingency fee means is that the lawyer does not take a dime from you until\nafter a) the claim has reached its conclusion and b) you win. That's right.\nYour lawyer will not accept any of your money but only a percentage of what\nyou are awarded for your claim, typically 33%.\n\nAnother common question is if your legal representation takes a percentage,\nwill you still have enough to pay for your treatment and repairs? Remember,\nthe lawyer is there to help the injured person after automobile accidents,\nyour recovery and relief of your physical pain comes first, and the fee the\nlawyer takes is built automatically into the claim they are asking for. Do not\nlet the cost of an attorney's services be a factor for your getting treatment\nbecause they shouldn't be.\n\n##\n\n## How Can You Help Your Personal Injury Lawyer Following Your Car Accident?\n\nEven though it is your experienced lawyers job to get you the compensation you\ndeserve following your accident, there are certain things you can do to make\ntheir jobs easier and thus make your earnings more readily available.\n\nTake pictures of the accident scene. If your injuries allow, document\neverything. Take photos of the scene, the car's themselves, your injuries, and\nanything that could be relevant to your case. It would also be prudent to\ngather witness statements, if applicable, and make an accident report with the\npolice.
