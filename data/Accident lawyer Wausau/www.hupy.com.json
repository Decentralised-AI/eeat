The percentage\nof the fee depends on the lawyer, so it\u2019s essential to do your research and\nfind out what types of fees they charge.\n\nMost personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis, meaning their\nfee is based on a percentage of your final settlement or amount received in\ncourt.

The answers to your questions can help you make your final decision on\nwhether they are the right lawyer for your personal injury case. Some\nquestions to ask may include the following:\n\n  * How many years have you been practicing in this field?\n  * Have you handled cases similar to mine before?\n  * What results have you achieved in similar personal injury cases?\n  * What do you think my case is worth?\n  * What type of evidence would be needed for my case?\n  * Do you see any challenges or downfalls with my case?\n  * Who would be my point of contact if I have questions or need updates during the duration of my case?\n  * How fast do you respond if I have questions?\n  * What are your preferred means of communication with your clients?\n  * What time do I have to file a personal injury lawsuit in Wisconsin?\n  * What are your legal fees? Do you work on a contingency?\n  * Are you prepared to represent me if my personal injury case goes to trial?\n\nFiling a personal injury claim can be stressful, so it is important that you\nfeel comfortable with the lawyer representing you throughout the process.\nAsking these questions during your initial consultation is essential for\nmaking sure that your case is handled properly and efficiently and that any\ncosts associated with it are clearly outlined from the start.
