When you contact us, our attorneys will walk you\nthrough everything that you need to do, in order to preserve your claim for\ncompensation.\n\nAfter an accident in North Central Wisconsin, you should:\n\n### 1\\. Seek prompt medical attention.\n\nSee a doctor, even if you think that you feel fine. Many accident victims do\nnot experience symptoms immediately, and seeking prompt medical attention will\nbe important to your personal injury claim.\n\n### 2\\. Take photos.\n\nIf you are able, take photos of everything possible. This includes the\nlocation where you were injured, vehicle damage (in the case of a car\naccident), damage to your clothes, and your physical injuries.\n\n### 3\\. Talk to witnesses.\n\nTry to collect contact information from any witnesses at the scene of the\naccident. These individuals may be able to provide important information to\nassist in your claim for compensation.\n\n### 4\\. Write down everything that you remember.\n\nWrite down everything that you can remember. No detail is too small, and\ntaking notes now can help you remember what happened, should you need to\ntestify in the future.\n\n### 5\\. Avoid giving statements to the insurance companies.\n\nThe insurance companies will most likely ask you to make recorded statements.\nYou want to avoid doing so until you speak with an attorney.\n\n## No Fee Unless You Win\n\nOur attorneys handle personal injury cases on a contingency-fee basis. This\nmeans that you do not pay any legal fees, unless we help you secure financial\ncompensation.
