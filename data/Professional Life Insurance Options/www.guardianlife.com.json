Many\nemployers offer it as a workplace benefit, and it\u2019s referred to as basic group\nlife insurance. There are both advantages and disadvantages to consider when\nlooking into these policies.\n\n### Advantages of life insurance through work\n\n  *  **Cost of the policy.** This is a plan that\u2019s purchased in bulk by your employer, and just like shopping for any other product, buying in bulk affords an attractive price. Many employees may be able to receive basic coverage paid for by their employer.\n\n  *  **Convenient.** Getting coverage through work is usually easy. Most paperwork is part of the hiring process and HR can help if you have any questions.\n\n  *  **Guaranteed coverage.** Basic life insurance policies through work are usually guaranteed. This means that even individuals with serious health conditions will be able to get a policy. Many employers also offer supplemental policies for additional coverage without asking you to share information about your health. Although supplemental policies do help you to get closer to the actual amount of coverage you should have, you\u2019ll likely still be short of the suggested amount, which depending on your age can be between 10x \u2013 30x your annual salary. 2\n\nLife insurance through work can be a great building block, but there are\nseveral reasons to consider adding your own coverage for comprehensive\nfinancial protection.\n\n### Disadvantages of life insurance through work\n\n  *  **Not enough life insurance coverage.** Any bargain shopper will know that there\u2019s usually a caveat to a good deal. Most group life insurance through work offers a relatively low policy ranging around $50,000 - $100,000, which may sound like a lot, but is a fraction of the suggested amounts you\u2019ll find in the chart below. 3\n\n  *  **It\u2019s connected to your job:** Even if you plan to stay at your current job for the rest of your life, your company may have to perform layoffs in the future, and this would cause you to lose your employer-provided life insurance. During the onset of the pandemic, many organizations had to unexpectedly cut ties with employees and this unforeseen termination can be devasting to your financial wellness. An extended stretch of unemployment could also leave you unprotected in an unstable economy, which can be an uncomfortable position, especially for a household\u2019s primary earner.\n\n  *  **May not cover your spouse.** While your employer\u2019s health insurance typically covers your spouse, it\u2019s not always the same for life insurance. If there is coverage, it\u2019s probably minimal \u2013 around $100,000. While it\u2019s better than nothing, it\u2019s rarely enough to save families from the financial hardship that they may face after a premature death.\n\n  *  **Lack of a permanent option.** The life coverage you get through work tends to be term life insurance, which is tied to a specific duration of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. When this term expires so does your coverage. You may not have access to the range of options that could be better suited for your financial situation, such as whole life insurance, which offers permanent coverage and a guaranteed death benefit that\u2019s paid to beneficiaries upon your passing. i Whole life insurance also includes a cash value component that can be withdrawn or borrowed from during your lifetime, which can be used for milestone purchases like a down payment on a new house. ii,iv\n\nVideo transcript\n\n## How much life insurance do you actually need?\n\n\u201cThe need for life insurance has never been greater than it is right now and\nthat\u2019s one of the new realities that the pandemic has brought to us,\u201d said\nMark Devine, Head of Product Management at Guardian, during the recent\nwebinar, _Let\u2019s talk life insurance: Protecting financial foundations_. Life\ninsurance is protection for your family in the event of an emergency and\nensuring that you\u2019re adequately insured is crucial. At least 6 in 10 life\ninsurance owners are underinsured but mistakenly believe that they have enough\ncoverage.4 The basic term life insurance policies offered through work can be\nlimited to low amounts \u2014 for instance, the same amount or double that of your\nannual salary. So, how much life insurance do you actually need?\n\n **Age**\n\n|\n\n **Maximum Life Insurance**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n **18-40**\n\n|\n\n30x income  \n  \n **41-50**\n\n|\n\n20x income  \n  \n **51-60**\n\n|\n\n15x income  \n  \n **61-65**\n\n|\n\n10x income  \n  \n **66-70**\n\n|\n\n1x net worth  \n  \n **71-80**\n\n|\n\n1/2x net worth  \n  \n **81+**\n\n|\n\nCase by case  \n  \n _Source: livingbalancesheet.com_\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively big number,\u201d says financial advisor, Neal Brincefield.\n\u201cThis is why it\u2019s so important that both group coverage and individual\ncoverage should be combined and really coordinated for most people to get to\nthat level of appropriate protection. It\u2019s going to take both.\u201d\n\n## Getting life insurance outside your employer\n\nIf your family relies on your income, you\u2019ll want to consider getting more\ncoverage to protect them beyond an employer-provided policy. Meeting with a\nfinancial professional to review your needs can be a big help in figuring out\nthe best options to keep your family financially stable after you\u2019re gone.\nWhole life, universal life, or additional term life insurance are all options\nthat can be a fit for your supplemental coverage needs. These policies offer\nbenefits that typical group term life insurance won\u2019t, such as guaranteed cash\nvalue growth that\u2019s tax deferred.iii\n\nThough group life insurance should not be overlooked, additional coverage can\nhelp ensure strong protection in the event of an untimely death. Basic group\nlife policies through work help to round out comprehensive life insurance\ncoverage; however, the limitations of these policies and the uncertainty of\nevents that would terminate coverage, such as losing your job, mean that\ngetting your own individual life insurance policy may help to ensure an after-\ndeath benefit for your family.\n\nRelated content\n\n  * Protecting those we love: The role of life insurance in financial wellness\n\n  * What Employees Want: Benefits that drive engagement and retention\n\n  * Term vs whole life insurance: Which is right for you?\n\n## Stay at the forefront\n\nLooking for more research, resources, and insights?

Younger Americans are even more likely to overestimate the cost\nof protection, saying it's _five times_ the actual price.1 But as you can see,\nit's possible to get $1,000,000 of life insurance for under $40 a month.\n\n## Average monthly costs for term life insurance\n\n **Age**\n\n|\n\n **Sex**\n\n|\n\n **$250,000**\n\n|\n\n **$500,000**\n\n|\n\n **$1,000,000**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n **25**\n\n|\n\nFemale\n\n|\n\n$14.25\n\n|\n\n$21.16\n\n|\n\n$33.70  \n  \n **25**\n\n|\n\nMale\n\n|\n\n$17.21\n\n|\n\n$26.98\n\n|\n\n$44.83  \n  \n **35**\n\n|\n\nFemale\n\n|\n\n$16.60\n\n|\n\n$25.60\n\n|\n\n$42.92  \n  \n **35**\n\n|\n\nMale\n\n|\n\n$18.93\n\n|\n\n$30.42\n\n|\n\n$52.01  \n  \n **45**\n\n|\n\nFemale\n\n|\n\n$28.99\n\n|\n\n$48.09\n\n|\n\n$87.12  \n  \n **45**\n\n|\n\nMale\n\n|\n\n$35.69\n\n|\n\n$60.99\n\n|\n\n$113.31  \n  \n **55**\n\n|\n\nFemale\n\n|\n\n$61.73\n\n|\n\n$109.39\n\n|\n\n$208.86  \n  \n **55**\n\n|\n\nMale\n\n|\n\n$85.22\n\n|\n\n$152.08\n\n|\n\n$285.50  \n  \nSource: https://www.policygenius.com/life-insurance/affordable-life-insurance/\nRates valid as of 04/01/2022\n\nThis chart reflects 20-year term life rates in April 2022 for non-smoking\napplicants with a \u201cPreferred\u201d health classification. These rates range from\n3.4\u00a2 per $1,000 to 34\u00a2 per $1,000 \u2013 a 10x spread  \u2013 depending on the\napplicant\u2019s age, gender, and coverage amount. What does it all mean for you?\nProbably not a lot because you're not an \"average,\" you're an individual. When\nyou buy a policy, life insurance companies will set your actual rates\naccording to criteria that are entirely dependent on you and your needs.\n\n## The three main factors that affect term life rates: It's all about you.\n\n **1**\n\n|\n\n **2**\n\n|\n\n **3**  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n **Your coverage amount**\n\n|\n\n **Your term length**\n\n|\n\n **Your life expectancy**  \n  \n###  **1\\. Coverage amount: the more you get, the higher your rates. But\u2026**\n\nTerm life insurance tends to be affordable, in the sense that you can get a\ngiven amount of coverage typically for much less than it would cost with a\npermanent whole life policy. Still, more coverage will cost more. But if\nyou're trying to decide between a higher or lower benefit amount, it may help\nto know that a higher death benefit can be more cost-effective than a lower\none. As the rate chart shows, the cost per $1,000 goes down as coverage levels\ngo. Stated another way, for any given applicant, $1,000,000 of coverage is\nusually less than twice the cost of $500,000 coverage.\n\n **How much do you actually need?** That's an entirely personal decision,\nbased on where you are in life and how many people rely on your income.\nHowever, there are several ways to get an estimate. Our life insurance\ncalculator uses the \"Human Life Value\" method, which looks at what you're\nearning now plus what you expect to earn in the future. (That's why it asks\nabout your earnings.) Between the ages of 18 and 40, it multiplies current\nincome by about 30; as you get older and have fewer working years left, that\nmultiple decreases.2 There are other methods to estimate your needs:\n\n **Consider multiplying your income by 10**\n\nTake your annual salary, add a \"0\" at the end, and there's your amount.\n$50,000 salary equals $500,000 coverage, $75,000 equals $750,000, and so on.\nWhile this estimation method is very simple, it doesn't actually take into\naccount your true expenses and needs. That leads us to the next formula, which\nis just a bit more complex.\n\n **Consider multiplying your income by 10 \u2013 and add college for each child**\n\nThis approach gives you the added reassurance of knowing your children may\nhave more opportunities. How much should you add? Account for somewhere\nbetween $100,000 and $150,000 per child. If you split the difference \u2013 and\nhave two kids \u2013 that's an extra $250,000.\n\n **Consider using the DIME formula.**\n\nDIME stands for Debt, Income, Mortgage, and Education \u2013 four of the big things\nto consider when making a detailed estimate of your life insurance needs:\n\n  *  **Debt:** Total all your debts other than your mortgage, and add about $7,000 for funeral expenses.\n\n  *  **Income:** Take your salary and multiply by the number of years you think your family needs protection \u2013 or at least as long as you have children at home.\n\n  *  **Mortgage:** Look at your last statement and get the payoff amount. If you have a 2 nd mortgage or HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit), add that in too.\n\n  *  **Education:** The anticipated cost for sending each of your children to college: between $100,000 and $150,000 per child.\n\nTotal them all up \u2013 then subtract any savings or existing life insurance \u2013 and\nthat's your estimated need. If you go through the exercise of estimating\naccording to each method, you'll find they each give you a different amount.\nHow do you choose? One more rule of thumb: go with the number that makes you\nfeel best about the protection you're providing for your loved ones.\n\n###  **2\\. Term length: A longer coverage period costs less \u2013 in the long\nrun**\n\nYou can get term life policies that last for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and even 30\nyears, but let's assume you need coverage for 20 years. If you compare two\nequivalent $1,000,000 policies \u2013 one for 10 years, the other for 20 \u2013 you'll\nsee the 20-year policy has higher monthly premiums. Unfortunately, that leads\nsome people to think they can save money with a 10-year policy. However, over\ntwo decades, a single 20-year policy will almost always cost less than two\nconsecutive 10-year policies. Why? Because even though your rates will be\nlower for the first 10-year term, the policy you get a decade later will cost\nsignificantly more. One of the most basic rules of life insurance is that it\ntypically costs more as you get older. Also, a lot can happen in a decade. For\nexample, your doctor could find that you have high blood pressure. Even if\nwell-controlled, that kind of diagnosis can cause rates to go up.\n\n###  **3\\. Life expectancy: Assessing your risk to the insurance company**\n\nWhy does life insurance get more expensive with age? Because life expectancy\ngoes down \u2013 a key factor used to determine rates. There's generally less risk\nto insuring a younger, more physically fit person because they are less likely\nto die in a given time frame \u2013 be it months, years or decades \u2013 compared to an\nolder, less healthy person. That's more than just common sense: It's a fact\nproven by actuarial science, the discipline that applies mathematical and\nstatistical methods to assess risk in insurance and other industries. When you\napply for a policy with a substantial death benefit, there's an application\nand underwriting process:  Insurers gather your information, consider your\nage, and evaluate your health with questions and, typically, a medical exam\nwhich includes blood work to check cholesterol levels and so on. Other items\nare also considered, including lifestyle and gender: Risky habits and\ndangerous hobbies (e.g., tobacco use, scuba diving) can make life insurance\nmore costly. Conversely, women tend to live longer, so they generally enjoy\nlower rates.\n\n **What about \"no health exam\" policies?** Sometimes you'll hear about life\ninsurance that doesn't require a medical exam or even health questions. These\n\"guaranteed acceptance\" policies tend to offer limited face amounts and can\ncost much more per $1,000 of coverage than a medically underwritten policy.\nAfter all, the insurance company has to assume that applicants have issues\nwith their health status. So while a guaranteed acceptance policy can be an\noption for seniors who want to cover their final expenses, it may not be a\ngood solution for younger, healthier wage-earners who want enough life\ninsurance coverage to provide for a family.\n\n## Look for a policy with these extras\n\nA term policy can last up to 30 years, and a lot can happen in that time. Your\nhealth could change. You could lose your ability to work. Consider these\ncoverage options, or riders, that can add protection and flexibility to your\nbase policy for relatively little added cost1.\n\n **Term conversion rider**\n\n|\n\n **Waiver of premium rider**\n\n2  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThis lets you convert to a permanent whole life policy with the same health\nrating \u2013 and no new medical exam. If your health takes a turn for the worse,\nconversion may help provide the lasting protection you want for your family.\nAll Guardian Level Term policies provide this feature for the first five\nyears, with the charge included in the premium. You can add an\n\n**Extended Conversion Rider (ECR)**\n\nwhich lets you convert to a whole life policy for the entire length of the\nterm.\n\n|\n\nIf you become disabled and can't work, this rider can pay your life insurance\npremiums and help keep your policy in effect. Guardian's version of this rider\nincludes a 7-year \"own-occupation\" definition, which means that even if you're\nable to do some work, payments may be waived if you can't work in your\nprofession or occupation. Guardian also offers an enhanced\n\n**Waiver Plus**\n\nrider: in conjunction with ECR, this lets you convert to a permanent policy\nafter five years of disability \u2013 and your insurance premiums will still be\nwaived as long as the disability continues.  \n  \n## What if you're not sure term life is right for you:\n\nTerm life is likely your most affordable option, but it may not always be the\noption that fits your needs. Maybe you want permanent protection. Or you don't\nlike the idea of paying premiums for 20 or 30 years with nothing left at the\nend. In that case, it may be worth looking at other options. While whole life\ninsurance rates are generally higher than those for term coverage, this type\nof policy can provide life-long coverage with wealth-building cash value3,4.\nConsider speaking with an experienced professional who will listen to your\nneeds and dig deep to learn more about your situation. They can help you\ndecide how much coverage is right for you and guide you through the different\nterm and permanent options that best fit your needs. How do you find such a\nprofessional? Ask a friend or colleague for a recommendation. Or, we can put\nyou in touch with a Guardian financial professional.\n\n###  **What if you  are sure term life is right for you:**\n\nIf group term life insurance is available to you through work, that can be a\nplace to start, and you may enjoy favorable group rates. However, many\ncompanies limit the amount of coverage offered to employees. And in some\ncases, coverage may not be portable, which means you may not be able to take\nit with you if you leave your employer. If you don't have workplace coverage\nor want to supplement it, it can be easy to shop for term life coverage\nonline. Many life insurance companies, including Guardian, make it simple to\nget a life insurance quote online, compare rates, and apply for coverage.\n\n## Frequently asked questions about the cost of life insurance\n\n###  **What should term life insurance cost?**\n\nThe average annual life insurance premium per U.S. household is $993.4\\\\.\nAccording to a recent survey of insurers and rates, the median cost for a\n20-year term policy was 11.1\u00a2 per $1,000 of coverage3. However, that number is\nan average life insurance cost for all applicants between the ages of 30 and\n50. The actual rate you'll pay will vary based on a range of conditions and\nitems, including the policy type, benefit amount, length of term, gender,\nhealth, and more.\n\n###  **What is the cost of a $500,000 Term life insurance policy?**\n\nIn 2021, the average monthly cost of life insurance for $500,000 of 20-year\nterm life insurance for a non-smoking male in good health is $28 at age 30; at\nage 40, it's $39; at age 50, $93. Women tend to live longer and enjoy lower\ninsurance rates, so the cost is $22 at 30; $33 at age 40; and $71 at 50.3\n\n###  **At what age should you buy life insurance?**\n\nIf you anticipate a significant life event, such as marriage or the birth of a\nchild, it can be a good time to start shopping insurers for a life insurance\nquote. Every individual of adult-age with child care or financial obligations\nshould consider getting a policy from a life insurance company to help pay for\nthose obligations in the event of his or her death. And it may not make sense\nto put off getting life insurance: conditions favor younger purchasers, who\nare more likely to get a lower rate.\n\n###  **What is better, term or whole life?**\n\nBoth policy types can provide valuable financial protection in the event of an\nunexpected death. However, whole life insurance offers several benefits\ncompared to a term life policy: the insurance policy is permanent, it has a\nwealth-building cash value component, and it can provide more ways to help\nprotect your family's finances over the long term. On the other hand, term\ninsurance can typically offer a larger death benefit for your premiums paid.\nYou should consult with a financial professional for guidance on the best\noption for your needs.\n\nSuggested articles\n\n  * Life insurance companies: Deciding what may be right for you\n\n  * Term vs. whole life insurance: Which is right for you?\n\n  * Why you should consider convertible term life insurance \n\n##\n\n###\n\nDisclaimer\n\n2022-137256 20240531\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.
