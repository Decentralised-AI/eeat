Many\nemployers offer it as a workplace benefit, and it\u2019s referred to as basic group\nlife insurance. There are both advantages and disadvantages to consider when\nlooking into these policies.\n\n### Advantages of life insurance through work\n\n  *  **Cost of the policy.** This is a plan that\u2019s purchased in bulk by your employer, and just like shopping for any other product, buying in bulk affords an attractive price. Many employees may be able to receive basic coverage paid for by their employer.\n\n  *  **Convenient.** Getting coverage through work is usually easy. Most paperwork is part of the hiring process and HR can help if you have any questions.\n\n  *  **Guaranteed coverage.** Basic life insurance policies through work are usually guaranteed. This means that even individuals with serious health conditions will be able to get a policy. Many employers also offer supplemental policies for additional coverage without asking you to share information about your health. Although supplemental policies do help you to get closer to the actual amount of coverage you should have, you\u2019ll likely still be short of the suggested amount, which depending on your age can be between 10x \u2013 30x your annual salary. 2\n\nLife insurance through work can be a great building block, but there are\nseveral reasons to consider adding your own coverage for comprehensive\nfinancial protection.\n\n### Disadvantages of life insurance through work\n\n  *  **Not enough life insurance coverage.** Any bargain shopper will know that there\u2019s usually a caveat to a good deal. Most group life insurance through work offers a relatively low policy ranging around $50,000 - $100,000, which may sound like a lot, but is a fraction of the suggested amounts you\u2019ll find in the chart below. 3\n\n  *  **It\u2019s connected to your job:** Even if you plan to stay at your current job for the rest of your life, your company may have to perform layoffs in the future, and this would cause you to lose your employer-provided life insurance. During the onset of the pandemic, many organizations had to unexpectedly cut ties with employees and this unforeseen termination can be devasting to your financial wellness. An extended stretch of unemployment could also leave you unprotected in an unstable economy, which can be an uncomfortable position, especially for a household\u2019s primary earner.\n\n  *  **May not cover your spouse.** While your employer\u2019s health insurance typically covers your spouse, it\u2019s not always the same for life insurance. If there is coverage, it\u2019s probably minimal \u2013 around $100,000. While it\u2019s better than nothing, it\u2019s rarely enough to save families from the financial hardship that they may face after a premature death.\n\n  *  **Lack of a permanent option.** The life coverage you get through work tends to be term life insurance, which is tied to a specific duration of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. When this term expires so does your coverage. You may not have access to the range of options that could be better suited for your financial situation, such as whole life insurance, which offers permanent coverage and a guaranteed death benefit that\u2019s paid to beneficiaries upon your passing. i Whole life insurance also includes a cash value component that can be withdrawn or borrowed from during your lifetime, which can be used for milestone purchases like a down payment on a new house. ii,iv\n\nVideo transcript\n\n## How much life insurance do you actually need?\n\n\u201cThe need for life insurance has never been greater than it is right now and\nthat\u2019s one of the new realities that the pandemic has brought to us,\u201d said\nMark Devine, Head of Product Management at Guardian, during the recent\nwebinar, _Let\u2019s talk life insurance: Protecting financial foundations_. Life\ninsurance is protection for your family in the event of an emergency and\nensuring that you\u2019re adequately insured is crucial. At least 6 in 10 life\ninsurance owners are underinsured but mistakenly believe that they have enough\ncoverage.4 The basic term life insurance policies offered through work can be\nlimited to low amounts \u2014 for instance, the same amount or double that of your\nannual salary. So, how much life insurance do you actually need?\n\n **Age**\n\n|\n\n **Maximum Life Insurance**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n **18-40**\n\n|\n\n30x income  \n  \n **41-50**\n\n|\n\n20x income  \n  \n **51-60**\n\n|\n\n15x income  \n  \n **61-65**\n\n|\n\n10x income  \n  \n **66-70**\n\n|\n\n1x net worth  \n  \n **71-80**\n\n|\n\n1/2x net worth  \n  \n **81+**\n\n|\n\nCase by case  \n  \n _Source: livingbalancesheet.com_\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively big number,\u201d says financial advisor, Neal Brincefield.\n\u201cThis is why it\u2019s so important that both group coverage and individual\ncoverage should be combined and really coordinated for most people to get to\nthat level of appropriate protection. It\u2019s going to take both.\u201d\n\n## Getting life insurance outside your employer\n\nIf your family relies on your income, you\u2019ll want to consider getting more\ncoverage to protect them beyond an employer-provided policy. Meeting with a\nfinancial professional to review your needs can be a big help in figuring out\nthe best options to keep your family financially stable after you\u2019re gone.\nWhole life, universal life, or additional term life insurance are all options\nthat can be a fit for your supplemental coverage needs. These policies offer\nbenefits that typical group term life insurance won\u2019t, such as guaranteed cash\nvalue growth that\u2019s tax deferred.iii\n\nThough group life insurance should not be overlooked, additional coverage can\nhelp ensure strong protection in the event of an untimely death. Basic group\nlife policies through work help to round out comprehensive life insurance\ncoverage; however, the limitations of these policies and the uncertainty of\nevents that would terminate coverage, such as losing your job, mean that\ngetting your own individual life insurance policy may help to ensure an after-\ndeath benefit for your family.\n\nRelated content\n\n  * Protecting those we love: The role of life insurance in financial wellness\n\n  * What Employees Want: Benefits that drive engagement and retention\n\n  * Term vs whole life insurance: Which is right for you?\n\n## Stay at the forefront\n\nLooking for more research, resources, and insights?

Policy loans and withdrawals affect the guarantees by reducing the\npolicy\u2019s death benefit and cash values.\n\nii: Some whole life polices do not have cash values in the first two years of\nthe po icy and don\u2019t pay a dividend until the policy\u2019s third year.

Dividends, if any, are affected by policy loans and loan\ninterest. Withdrawals above the cost basis may result in taxable ordinary\nincome. If the policy lapses, or is surrendered, any outstanding loans\nconsidered gain in the policy may be subject to ordinary income taxes. If the\npolicy is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC), loans are treated like\nwithdrawals, but as gain first, subject to ordinary income taxes.
