It protects you and your\nfamily now and throughout your life and is more affordable than you may\nthink.2\n\n### Permanent life insurance offers:\n\n  * The potential to build cash value during your lifetime.\n  * The ability to access your money through loans and withdrawals for things such as paying for college, retirement or long-term care.\n  * A generally income tax-free payout to your loved ones upon your passing (known as a death benefit).\n\n##### Indexed Universal Life Insurance\n\n##### Indexed Universal Life Insurance\n\nFlexibility to pay premiums in different amounts or at different times,\ntypically while earning a fixed interest rate each month, with Indexed\nUniversal Life policies.  \n  \nIndexed Universal Life products\n\n##### Variable Universal Life Insurance\n\n##### Variable Universal Life Insurance\n\nGreater opportunities to increase cash value by investing directly in the\nmarket, with the security of a guaranteed minimum death benefit, with Variable\nUniversal Life policies.3\n\n3  There is investment risk with variable universal life, including the\npossible loss of principal invested.\n\nVariable Universal Life products\n\n##### Survivorship Life Insurance\n\n##### Survivorship Life Insurance\n\nA cost-effective way to insure two people, usually a married couple, to\nsupplement your retirement income or maximize the legacy you both leave, with\nSurvivorship Life insurance.\n\n\n\nSurvivorship Life Insurance products\n\n##### Long-Term Care Coverage\n\n##### Long-Term Care Coverage\n\nThe ability to set aside money for the people you want to protect, with the\nassurance it will return as a death benefit to those who depend on you if you\ndon\u2019t need it, with long-term care coverage provided, required premiums are\npaid.4\n\n\n\nLong-Term resources\n\n## Term life insurance\n\nTerm life insurance is generally the most affordable type of coverage. It\noffers protection for a specific period of time, but without the potential to\ngrow the cash value in the policy.\n\nTerm life insurance offers:\n\n  * Security that comes with knowing a death benefit will be paid to your loved ones if you pass away \u2014 for example, while your children are still young or your business is still growing.\n  * Coverage for a defined term \u2014 unlike permanent life insurance, which covers you for life (provided that the premiums are paid) and provides potential for cash value accumulation.\n\n## Know the difference between life insurance types\n\n#### **Permanent life insurance offers...**\n\n|\n\n#### **Term life insurance offers...**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nProtection now and throughout your life\n\n|\n\nProtection for a specific period of time  \n  \nA generally income tax-free death benefit payout to your loved ones upon your\npassing\n\n|\n\nA generally income tax-free death benefit payout to your loved ones upon your\npassing  \n  \nThe ability to accumulate cash value in the policy\n\n|\n\nCoverage that is generally more affordable than permanent life insurance\npolicies  \n  \n#### **Consider this...**\n\nCaring for aging loved ones\n\n#### **Fundamentals**\n\n#### **Common questions**\n\n1  Policy loans and withdrawals will reduce the cash value and death benefit\nof the contracts. Clients may need to fund higher premiums in later years to\nkeep the policy from lapsing. Under current federal tax rules, you generally\nmay take income tax-free partial withdrawals under a life insurance policy\nthat is not a modified endowment contract (MEC), up to your basis in the\ncontract. Additional amounts are includible in income. The IRS places a limit\non how much money can go into life insurance premiums for the policy and how\nquickly such premiums can be paid in order for the policy to retain all of its\ntax benefits. If certain limits are exceeded, a MEC results. MEC policyholders\nmay be subject to taxes on distributions on an income-first basis, that is, to\nthe extent there is gain in their policies, as well as penalties on any\ntaxable amount if they are not age 59 1/2 or older. Loans taken will be free\nof current income tax as long as the policy remains in effect until the\ninsured's death, does not lapse and is not a MEC. Please note that outstanding\nloans accrue interest. Income tax-free treatment also assumes the loan will\neventually be satisfied from income tax-free death benefit proceeds. Loans and\nwithdrawals reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, may cause\ncertain policy benefits or riders to become unavailable and may increase the\nchance the policy may lapse. If the policy lapses, is surrendered or becomes a\nMEC, the loan balance at such time would generally be viewed as distributed\nand taxable under the general rules for distribution of policy cash values. In\naddition, withdrawals, policy loans and any accrued loan interest may cause\nyour policy to lapse even if you are in a period of coverage under the No-\nLapse Guarantee Rider. Speak to your financial professional before taking any\nwithdrawals or policy loans.\n\n2  As long as you pay the required premiums.\n\n3  There is investment risk with variable universal life, including the\npossible loss of principal invested.\n\n4  This is provided through a Long-term Care Servicessm rider, which is\navailable for a additional charge.  Additionally, there are restrictions and\nlimitations.  A client may qualify for the life insurance, but not the rider.\nIt is paid as an acceleration of the death benefit.\n\n**Variable universal life insurance is sold by prospectus only, which contains\nmore complete information about the product, including investment objectives,\nrisks, charges, expenses, limitations and restrictions. Please read the\nproduct prospectus and consider the information carefully before purchasing a\npolicy or sending money. You should contact your financial professional for a\ncopy of the current prospectus.**\n\nA variable universal life insurance contract is a contract with the primary\npurpose of providing a death benefit. It is also a long-term financial\ninvestment that can also allow potential accumulation of assets through\ncustomized, professionally managed investment portfolios. These portfolios are\nclosely managed in order to satisfy stated investment objectives.\n\nThere are fees and charges associated with variable life insurance contracts,\nincluding mortality and risk charges, a front-end load, administrative fees,\ninvestment management fees, surrender charges and charges for optional riders.\nThere are fees and charges associated with permanent life insurance,\nincluding, but not limited to, insurance charges, surrender charges, a front-\nend load and administrative charges.\n\nEquitable Financial and its affiliates do not provide legal or tax advice.\nClients must rely on their own advisors on these matters.\n\nLife insurance is issued by Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company\n(Equitable Financial), New York, NY 10104; or by Equitable Financial Life\nInsurance Company of America (Equitable America), an Arizona Stock\nCorporation, with main administrative office in Jersey City, NJ.
