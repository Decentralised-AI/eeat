Once a policy is issued, an insurer may not cancel it based\non a change in the policyholder\u2019s health status. There are several types of\nlife insurance, allowing consumers to find a policy type that works for their\npersonal situation.\n\n**Term Life Insurance**\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage over a specified period of time.\nTypically, term insurance policies are written for 1, 5, 10, or 20 years, or\nto a specified age (such as 65). Term policies only pay a death benefit to the\nbeneficiary if the policyholder dies during the specified term and so is a\ngood choice when the policyholder needs protection for a temporary time or a\nspecific need. Term insurance has the advantage of being more affordable than\npermanent insurance, particularly in the early policy durations. There are a\nfew different types of term life insurance policies:\n\n  * The most common, **level term insurance** , is characterized by level policy face amounts over the contract term period, usually 10, 20, or 30 years. The death benefit amount and policy amounts are usually guaranteed to remain level during this time, regardless of the insured\u2019s health status.\n  * **Decreasing term insurance** policies feature a decreasing death benefit. A policyholder may use these types of policies to cover financial obligations that decrease over time, such as a mortgage.\n  * **Renewable term insurance** guarantees the policyholder the right to renew at the end of the contract period without evidence of insurability as long as the premium is paid.\n  * **Convertible term insurance** allows the policyholder to convert a term insurance policy to a permanent insurance policy that will build cash values in later years. Typically, these premiums are higher to reflect the additional cost of building up cash value for the policy.\n  * Term insurance policies can also have a **Return of Premium (ROP)** feature which refunds part or all of the premiums paid at the end of a level term period if death benefits are not paid out. Policies with this feature are more expensive because the policyholder has the ability to receive cash back.\n\n**Whole Life Insurance**\n\nWhole life insurance provides a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the\nlife of the insured, with the benefits payable only upon the insured\u2019s death.\nWhole life policies are designed to build tax deferred cash value, which is\nthe accumulation of premiums collected less applicable expenses and applicable\ninsurance charges and they allow for borrowing against the cash value of the\npolicy. As mandated by state law, whole life policies contain nonforfeiture\nvalues payable in cash or some other form of insurance in the event the policy\nlapses from nonpayment of required premiums or the policy owner decides to\nsurrender the coverage. There are several types of whole life insurance\npolicies.\n\n  * A **nonparticipating whole life insurance policy** does not pay dividends to the policy owner, but rather the insurer sets the level premium, death benefits and cash surrender values at the time of purchase. These amounts are fixed at policy issue.\n  * A **participating policy** allows the insured to share in the insurers investment, expense and mortality experience by providing dividends used to reduce premium payments or to purchase paid-up additional insurance. The dividend options make these policies both more flexible and more expensive than nonparticipating policies.\n  * **Indeterminate premium whole life insurance** is a nonparticipating policy featuring adjustable premiums which are set annually and reflect the insurer\u2019s mortality experience, investment earnings and expenses, although they may not exceed a guaranteed maximum rate. Premiums generally start out lower than other whole life insurance types.\n  * **Ordinary level premium whole life insurance** features premium payments that remain consistent until the death of the insured or attainment of a terminal age when the cash value equals the face amount of the policy.\n  * **Limited payment whole life insurance** can be either participating or nonparticipating. Premiums are paid over a shorter period, but still retain lifetime protection. These policies have higher premium amounts and accrue cash value faster than ordinary life policies, since they are paid over a shorter period.\n  * **Single premium whole life insurance** is a limited payment whole life policy allowing insureds to purchase guaranteed lifetime protection for a single upfront lump sum payment and thus have an immediate cash value.\n\n**Universal Life Insurance**\n\nUniversal life insurance is permanent life insurance combining term insurance\nwith a cash account earning tax-deferred interest. Under most contracts,\npremiums and/or death benefits can fluctuate at policyholder discretion. The\npolicy stays in effect as long as the cash value is sufficient to cover the\ncost of insurance and loans can be taken against the cash value of the policy.\n\nThere are also **variable universal life insurance** products which are kept\nin an insurer's separate account. The interest accrued under these contracts\nare not guaranteed and may in fact be negative since interest is a function of\nthe change in the market value of the separate account assets.\n\nRecent years have seen the rise of **indexed universal policies** , which have\nboth fixed and variable features. Under these policies, interest credits are\nlinked to external index of investments, such as bonds or the S&P 500. These\nindex products do provide an interest rate guarantee.\n\n**Status**\n\nLife insurance and **annuities** are regulated by state insurance\ncommissioners. The NAIC encourages states to adopt **model laws** and\nregulations designed to inform and protect insurance consumers. The NAIC Life\nInsurance  **Disclosure Model Regulation** (#580) requires insurers to deliver\nto purchasers of life insurance information that will improve the buyer's\nunderstanding of the policy and ability to select the most appropriate plan\nfor the buyer's needs. The NAIC **Life Insurance Illustrations Model\nRegulation** (#582) provides rules for life insurance policy illustrations\nthat will protect consumers and foster consumer education. The NAIC **Consumer\nCredit Insurance Model Regulation** (#370) protects the interests of debtors\nand the public by providing a system of rate, policy form, and operating\nstandards for the transaction of credit life insurance.\n\nThe NAIC Life Insurance Illustration Issues (A) Working Group, created in\n2016, continues to explore how the narrative summary required by Section 7B of\nModel (#582) and the policy summary required by Section 5A(2) of Model (#580)\ncan be enhanced to promote consumer readability and understandability. This\nincludes how they are designed, formatted and accessed by consumers. The\nWorking Group is currently discussing draft proposals to amend Model #580 to\nincorporate a policy overview requirement that encourages (not mandates) the\nuse of a template by providing a safe harbor if the template is used.\n\nThe NAIC **Life Actuarial (A) Task Force** was formed to identify, investigate\nand develop solutions to actuarial problems in the life insurance industry.\nAfter adoption of the **Standard Valuation Law (#820)** by 46 states\nrepresenting 87.5% of industry premium prior to July 1, 2016, the Standard\nValuation Law became operative on January 1, 2017. The Valuation Manual is\nrevised annually to add clarity to existing requirements and enact new\nrequirements. The Task Force has adopted revised Generally Recognized Expense\nTable (GRET) factors for 2021.\n\n\n\n## Committees Related to This Topic\n\nLife Insurance and Annuities (A) Committee\n\nLife Actuarial (A) Task Force\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nLife Insurance  \n _NAIC Consumer Resource Center_\n\nBe Skeptical About \"Free Meal\" Seminars  \n _December 2017, NAIC Consumer Alert_\n\nLife Product Update Presentation  \n _May 2017, SOA Life & Annuity Symposium_\n\n2017 Universal Life with Secondary Guarantees Survey  \n _July 2017, SOA_\n\nLife Insurance Buyers Guide\n\nSOA Life Insurance Research Reports\n\n## News Releases\n\nNAIC Consumer Alert \u2013 Life Insurance Roadmap  \n_March 2016, NAIC_\n\n## Related Topics\n\nActuarial Guideline XXXVIII (AG 38)\n\n## Contacts\n\n_Media queries should be directed to the NAIC Communications Division at\n816-783-8909 ornews@naic.org._\n\nScott O'Neal  \nLife Examination Actuary  \n(816) 783\u20138814\n\nJennifer Cook  \nSenior Counsel for Life and Health Policy  \n(202) 471-3986\n\nJolie Matthews  \nSenior Health and Life Counsel  \n(202) 471-3982\n\nNAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR)\n\nCIPR Homepage\n\n\u00a9 1991-2024 National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nStop.Call.Confirm is a registered service mark of the National Association of\nInsurance Commissioners.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAccessibility\n\nConnect\n\nWorkplace\n\nWeb CMS\n\n###### Services\n\n__\n\nMyNAIC iSite+ Financial Statement Filing Automated Valuation Service Account\nManager\n\n###### Resources\n\n__\n\nResource Center Newsroom Publications Meetings and Events Education and\nTraining Glossary of Insurance Terms\n\n###### Support\n\n__\n\nContact Help Careers\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n",
