Rather than leaving your family with existing debt, funeral\nexpenses and other everyday costs, they'll receive a tax-free death benefit or\npayout. This can provide financial security and stability. With a life\ninsurance policy, you're prepared for the worst but can plan for the best.\n\nShow Transcript\n\nVO: Meet Suzie. She just purchased life insurance through Allstate.\n\nVO: It gives her a way to provide financial security to her family if she\npasses away.\n\nVO: So, what can life insurance be used for?\n\nLife insurance payouts can be used for anything. Her policy amount will\ndetermine just  \nhow much her family receives, but common uses include:\n\nVO: Funeral and burial costs  \nEveryday expenses  \nRent or mortgage  \nEducation  \nAnd leaving an inheritance\n\nVO: Well, what does Suzie have to do?  \nFirst, she must apply and be approved.  \nThen, she makes her payments, or premiums,  \nand if she passes away, her beneficiaries receive the payout tax-free.\n\nVO: How much will she pay? Premiums vary and depend on a few factors. Some\nare:\n\nVO: Amount of coverage  \nlength of time she has it, as she can choose a term or permanent policy  \nand Suzie\u2019s health and age when she purchases.\n\nVO: Well, what does life insurance give to Suzie?\n\nVO: Peace of mind, because she knows her loved ones will be protected if she\npasses away.\n\n## Do I need life insurance?\n\nJust about everyone can benefit from some level of life insurance protection\nfor their loved ones. You might be just starting out, raising a family, or\npreparing for your golden years\u2014as long as you have loved ones you want to\nprotect if you pass away, life insurance can help. The key is finding a policy\nthat fits _you_. Whether you\u2019re looking for a lot of coverage or just the\nbasics, we have a policy for what you need.\n\n**Life insurance can help your loved ones:**\n\n  * Cover the rising cost of funeral expenses\n  * Replace lost wages or the value of your time (e.g., stay-at-home spouse)\n  * Pay off debt\n  * Provide for a college education\n  * Leave an inheritance\n\n## How much coverage do I need?\n\nA good starting place for determining how much coverage you need is to add up\nany financial responsibilities your loved ones would be left with. That could\ninclude the cost of a funeral, childcare, a mortgage, college education,\noutstanding debts or other everyday expenses. Your coverage amounts should\naccount for things you currently pay for or know you will be paying for in the\nfuture.\n\nWithout enough coverage, your family might be left with large, unexpected\nfinancial burdens. Our coverage calculator can help you land on an estimate to\nensure they\u2019re protected.\n\nfind the right coverage\n\n## What types of life insurance are there?\n\nMost life insurance falls in two basic categories: term and permanent. Term\nlasts for a set period of time, and permanent lasts your entire life.\n\n| **Term life** | **Permanent life**  \n---|---|---  \n**Cost** | As low as $10/mo | Price varies  \n**Coverage term** | 10-40 years | Your entire life  \n**In-person medical exam** | Sometimes required | Sometimes required  \n**Other benefits that may be available** |\n\n  * Conversion to a permanent policy\n  * Coverage for children\n  * Accidental death benefit\n\n|\n\n  * Cash value with tax-deferred growth \n  * Ability to take out loans or withdrawals on policy value \n  * Accidental death benefit\n  * Optional add-ons for long term care coverage (not Accidental death benefit)\n\n  \n  \n## Which life insurance policy is right for me?\n\nWhich life policy is right for you depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Our\nLifeTrek tool can help identify the level of life insurance protection you\nneed, taking into account your finances and unique goals. Just answer a few\nquestions.\n\nfind the right policy\n\n## Why choose term life insurance?\n\nTerm life insurance is perfect for anyone trying to save money today and keep\ntheir loved ones protected in the future. Whether you\u2019re single, married with\nkids, approaching retirement, or anywhere in between, an active term life\ninsurance policy protects whoever might be left with a financial burden. It\u2019s\nalso significantly less expensive than permanent life insurance.\n\nlearn about term life\n\n## peace of mind at a  \nprice that fits your life\n\nGet a quick quote for term life insurance\n\nget a quote\n\n## What is permanent life insurance?\n\nPermanent life insurance is a policy that lasts from the time you buy it until\nthe time you pass away\u2014assuming all ongoing payments are made. On top of\npaying a death benefit to your family, it can also include a separate cash\nvalue savings component. Cash value can benefit you while alive by helping you\npay your premiums, take out loans on your policy and more.\n\nThere are a few different permanent life insurance policy options. Looking for\npermanent life insurance? Find an agent.\n\n  * ### Whole\n\nWhole life insurance gives predictable lifelong protection with the most\nguarantees, like a fixed premium and death benefit.\n\nlearn more\n\n  * ### Universal\n\nUniversal life insurance provides flexible protection that can last your\nlifetime and includes some cash accumulation options.\n\nlearn more\n\n  * ### Variable\n\nVariable life insurance offers different investment options for cash value and\nflexibility in benefits.\n\nlearn more\n\n## What factors shape my life insurance cost?\n\nWhat you pay for life insurance is affected by a lot of factors. Some of those\nfactors are related to you, others are related to the world around you.\n\n  * **Age:** Generally, the younger you are when you buy your policy, the lower your premium will be.\n  * **Term vs. Permanent:** Term policies are significantly less expensive than permanent plans.\n  * **Length of term:** Term policies are available in 10- to 40-year term lengths.\n  * **Coverage amount:** A policy with a larger death benefit amount will naturally cost more than a similar policy with a smaller benefit amount.\n  * **Health history:** Things like your current health, health history and family medical history all shape your price.\n  * **Lifestyle:** Smoking or high-risk hobbies often lead to higher premiums.\n\n## Life insurance FAQs\n\n### Can life insurance be affordable on a tight budget?\n\nIt certainly can. The misconception about the price of life insurance is the\nmain reason many people opt out. Consumers think life insurance costs nearly\nthree times the actual price, according to a report by the nonprofit Life\nHappens. Premiums depend on many factors, including your age and health, so\nit's advised to look into life insurance now rather than waiting until you\u2019re\nolder.\n\n### I have life insurance through my work. Why do I need an individual policy?\n\nEmployers often offer life insurance policies \u2014 and that\u2019s a great start. The\nproblem is this coverage only lasts while you\u2019re employed with the company,\nwhich puts you at risk if you change or lose your job. And most people usually\nneed far more than what their employee can offer.\n\n### Should I wait to buy life insurance?\n\nNot married? Kids not in your immediate future? You may think you don\u2019t need\nlife insurance yet, but it may be to your advantage to buy it today.\nGenerally, the younger and healthier you are when you initially purchase life\ninsurance, the less expensive it is, and the easier it is to qualify for it.\nEach year that you wait to purchase life insurance, your rates will most\nlikely increase. And if you develop any health issues in the future, it may\nimpact your ability to get life insurance regardless of your age.\n\n _Stories & tips_  \nfor everyday life\n\nprevious\n\n  * Expecting a baby?
