Rather than leaving your family with existing debt, funeral\nexpenses and other everyday costs, they'll receive a tax-free death benefit or\npayout. This can provide financial security and stability. With a life\ninsurance policy, you're prepared for the worst but can plan for the best.\n\nShow Transcript\n\nVO: Meet Suzie. She just purchased life insurance through Allstate.\n\nVO: It gives her a way to provide financial security to her family if she\npasses away.\n\nVO: So, what can life insurance be used for?\n\nLife insurance payouts can be used for anything. Her policy amount will\ndetermine just  \nhow much her family receives, but common uses include:\n\nVO: Funeral and burial costs  \nEveryday expenses  \nRent or mortgage  \nEducation  \nAnd leaving an inheritance\n\nVO: Well, what does Suzie have to do?  \nFirst, she must apply and be approved.  \nThen, she makes her payments, or premiums,  \nand if she passes away, her beneficiaries receive the payout tax-free.\n\nVO: How much will she pay? Premiums vary and depend on a few factors. Some\nare:\n\nVO: Amount of coverage  \nlength of time she has it, as she can choose a term or permanent policy  \nand Suzie\u2019s health and age when she purchases.\n\nVO: Well, what does life insurance give to Suzie?\n\nVO: Peace of mind, because she knows her loved ones will be protected if she\npasses away.\n\n## Do I need life insurance?\n\nJust about everyone can benefit from some level of life insurance protection\nfor their loved ones. You might be just starting out, raising a family, or\npreparing for your golden years\u2014as long as you have loved ones you want to\nprotect if you pass away, life insurance can help. The key is finding a policy\nthat fits _you_. Whether you\u2019re looking for a lot of coverage or just the\nbasics, we have a policy for what you need.\n\n**Life insurance can help your loved ones:**\n\n  * Cover the rising cost of funeral expenses\n  * Replace lost wages or the value of your time (e.g., stay-at-home spouse)\n  * Pay off debt\n  * Provide for a college education\n  * Leave an inheritance\n\n## How much coverage do I need?\n\nA good starting place for determining how much coverage you need is to add up\nany financial responsibilities your loved ones would be left with. That could\ninclude the cost of a funeral, childcare, a mortgage, college education,\noutstanding debts or other everyday expenses. Your coverage amounts should\naccount for things you currently pay for or know you will be paying for in the\nfuture.\n\nWithout enough coverage, your family might be left with large, unexpected\nfinancial burdens. Our coverage calculator can help you land on an estimate to\nensure they\u2019re protected.\n\nfind the right coverage\n\n## What types of life insurance are there?\n\nMost life insurance falls in two basic categories: term and permanent. Term\nlasts for a set period of time, and permanent lasts your entire life.\n\n| **Term life** | **Permanent life**  \n---|---|---  \n**Cost** | As low as $10/mo | Price varies  \n**Coverage term** | 10-40 years | Your entire life  \n**In-person medical exam** | Sometimes required | Sometimes required  \n**Other benefits that may be available** |\n\n  * Conversion to a permanent policy\n  * Coverage for children\n  * Accidental death benefit\n\n|\n\n  * Cash value with tax-deferred growth \n  * Ability to take out loans or withdrawals on policy value \n  * Accidental death benefit\n  * Optional add-ons for long term care coverage (not Accidental death benefit)\n\n  \n  \n## Which life insurance policy is right for me?\n\nWhich life policy is right for you depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Our\nLifeTrek tool can help identify the level of life insurance protection you\nneed, taking into account your finances and unique goals. Just answer a few\nquestions.\n\nfind the right policy\n\n## Why choose term life insurance?\n\nTerm life insurance is perfect for anyone trying to save money today and keep\ntheir loved ones protected in the future. Whether you\u2019re single, married with\nkids, approaching retirement, or anywhere in between, an active term life\ninsurance policy protects whoever might be left with a financial burden. It\u2019s\nalso significantly less expensive than permanent life insurance.\n\nlearn about term life\n\n## peace of mind at a  \nprice that fits your life\n\nGet a quick quote for term life insurance\n\nget a quote\n\n## What is permanent life insurance?\n\nPermanent life insurance is a policy that lasts from the time you buy it until\nthe time you pass away\u2014assuming all ongoing payments are made. On top of\npaying a death benefit to your family, it can also include a separate cash\nvalue savings component. Cash value can benefit you while alive by helping you\npay your premiums, take out loans on your policy and more.\n\nThere are a few different permanent life insurance policy options. Looking for\npermanent life insurance? Find an agent.\n\n  * ### Whole\n\nWhole life insurance gives predictable lifelong protection with the most\nguarantees, like a fixed premium and death benefit.\n\nlearn more\n\n  * ### Universal\n\nUniversal life insurance provides flexible protection that can last your\nlifetime and includes some cash accumulation options.\n\nlearn more\n\n  * ### Variable\n\nVariable life insurance offers different investment options for cash value and\nflexibility in benefits.\n\nlearn more\n\n## What factors shape my life insurance cost?\n\nWhat you pay for life insurance is affected by a lot of factors. Some of those\nfactors are related to you, others are related to the world around you.\n\n  * **Age:** Generally, the younger you are when you buy your policy, the lower your premium will be.\n  * **Term vs. Permanent:** Term policies are significantly less expensive than permanent plans.\n  * **Length of term:** Term policies are available in 10- to 40-year term lengths.\n  * **Coverage amount:** A policy with a larger death benefit amount will naturally cost more than a similar policy with a smaller benefit amount.\n  * **Health history:** Things like your current health, health history and family medical history all shape your price.\n  * **Lifestyle:** Smoking or high-risk hobbies often lead to higher premiums.\n\n## Life insurance FAQs\n\n### Can life insurance be affordable on a tight budget?\n\nIt certainly can. The misconception about the price of life insurance is the\nmain reason many people opt out. Consumers think life insurance costs nearly\nthree times the actual price, according to a report by the nonprofit Life\nHappens. Premiums depend on many factors, including your age and health, so\nit's advised to look into life insurance now rather than waiting until you\u2019re\nolder.\n\n### I have life insurance through my work. Why do I need an individual policy?\n\nEmployers often offer life insurance policies \u2014 and that\u2019s a great start. The\nproblem is this coverage only lasts while you\u2019re employed with the company,\nwhich puts you at risk if you change or lose your job. And most people usually\nneed far more than what their employee can offer.\n\n### Should I wait to buy life insurance?\n\nNot married? Kids not in your immediate future? You may think you don\u2019t need\nlife insurance yet, but it may be to your advantage to buy it today.\nGenerally, the younger and healthier you are when you initially purchase life\ninsurance, the less expensive it is, and the easier it is to qualify for it.\nEach year that you wait to purchase life insurance, your rates will most\nlikely increase. And if you develop any health issues in the future, it may\nimpact your ability to get life insurance regardless of your age.\n\n _Stories & tips_  \nfor everyday life\n\nprevious\n\n  * Expecting a baby?

With quality coverage in a business insurance policy from\nAllstate, you can have peace of mind and help protect a business your clients\nrely on.\n\nBelow are coverages that may be available for your business. An Allstate agent\ncan also help explain what coverages are standard and which are available as\nadd-ons so you can craft a business owners policy (BOP) that fits your needs.\nSome coverages are subject to deductibles and limits.\n\n## Explore property coverages\n\n**Property risks** | **Allstate coverage**  \n---|---  \n**Damaged documents**  \nA pipe bursts and leaks over a filing cabinet that contains critical\ndocuments. Many documents are damaged and others are completely destroyed. |\n**Valuable Papers and Records**  \nThis helps cover the cost of restoring important business documents that are\ndamaged or destroyed by a covered loss. This coverage is included in the basic\nBOP and can be increased if you opt for additional coverage.  \n**Billing records are destroyed**  \nThere is a fire and your company's billing records are destroyed. This makes\nit difficult for you to collect payments from customers. | **Accounts\nReceivable Protection**  \nThis covers the increased cost of collecting payments and the expense of\nreestablishing the records of accounts receivable.  \n**Employee dishonesty**  \nYour business receives checks, credit card payments and sometimes cash for\nwork that you do. When reviewing the receipts for the week, you notice that\nthe deposits were lower than usual. | **Employee Dishonesty Coverage**  \nThis coverage helps pay for a loss if an employee steals money or property\nfrom your business. It is typically an optional coverage.  \n**Computer hack**  \nIt is discovered that someone hacked into your bank account and transferred\nfunds out of your account. | **Computer Fraud and Funds Transfer Fraud\nCoverage**  \nThese optional coverages kick in if someone uses a computer to fraudulently\ntransfer money, securities or other property to someone else.  \n**Building or property damage**  \nIf your business building or business property are destroyed due to a covered\nloss, such as a fire or theft, costs could add up quickly. | **Business\nBuilding/Personal Property Coverage**  \nThis coverage pays to repair or replace your owned business building and/or\nyour business personal property, up to the limits you select.  \n**You can't open your business**  \nYour business is damaged due to a fire and you cannot operate until repairs\nare made. |\n\n**Business Income and Extra Expense Coverage**  \nThis coverage helps with loss of income and fixed expenses, such as rent or\npayroll, while your business is temporarily closed for repairs after a covered\nloss.\n\nThis coverage provides your business with up to 12 months of coverage.  \n  \n**Computer virus attack**  \nYou get an email from a client, but you open it to discover that it contains a\nvirus. |\n\n**Electronic Data Coverage**  \nThese optional coverages kick in if someone uses a computer to fraudulently\ntransfer money, securities or other property to someone else.\n\nThis coverage is included in a basic BOP, but you have the option to increase\ncoverage limits.  \n  \n## Explore liability coverages\n\n**Liability risks** | **Allstate coverage**  \n---|---  \n**Injury lawsuit**  \nYou are sued because somebody was injured after slipping on a recently mopped\nfloor at your business.  | **General Liability Protection**  \nThis provides coverage for injury to others at your premises and helps protect\nyou from lawsuits filed against you.  \n**Client lawsuit**  \nA client follows your advice, but it does not turn out the way they expected,\nand they sue you.\n\nFor example, you're a real estate agent and list a home for sale at the\nincorrect price. A buyer makes an offer but sues you after the error is\nidentified and the price is increased.\n\n| **Miscellaneous Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions Coverage**  \nThis covers legal obligations arising out of professional errors, negligent\nacts or omissions during the course of practicing your profession.  \n**Wrongful termination lawsuit**  \nA former employee sues you for wrongful termination. | **Employment Practices\nLiability Coverage**  \nThis provides coverage and support in the event of a lawsuit related to\nwrongful termination, sexual harassment or discrimination. This is typically\nan optional coverage.  \n**Customer data loss or theft**  \nCustomers' confidential personal and financial data that you maintain is lost\nor stolen. | **Data Compromise Coverage**  \nThis optional coverage provides case management, legal support, credit\nmonitoring and legally required notifications after customer data is affected.  \n  \n## Explore auto coverages\n\n**Auto risks** | **Allstate coverage**  \n---|---  \n**An employee causes an accident**  \nWhile performing work for you, your employee gets into an accident and causes\ninjury or damage to another person or their property. You could be held\nliable. | **Liability Protection**  \nThis coverage helps pay for someone else's medical bills and/or repairs to\ntheir vehicle, even if it's due to your employee's negligence.  \n**Vehicle damage**  \nDamage to your vehicle, whether your driver was at fault or not, can result in\nunexpected repair bills. | **Collision Coverage**  \nThis protection pays to repair damage or replace your car if it is a total\nloss.  \n**Hail damage**  \nHail can cause damage to your business vehicle, such as large dents and broken\nglass. | **Comprehensive Coverage**  \nThis protection pays to repair hail damage to your business vehicle. This\ncoverage may also help repair damage from other non-accident-related events,\nsuch as fire, theft or vandalism.  \n**You are injured by an uninsured driver**  \nIf you or your employee are in a collision with an uninsured driver and\nsustain serious injuries, your livelihood could be at risk. | **Uninsured\nMotorist Coverage**  \nThis coverage helps pay for your medical bills if you are injured in an\naccident that is caused by a driver with no insurance. Or, you may have the\nprotection you need, depending on your policy's bodily injury limit. (Coverage\nrestrictions apply in some states, so be sure to talk to your agent.)  \n**You owe money on a damaged vehicle**  \nIf you still owe money on a loan or lease, you could be responsible for the\ncost of replacing the vehicle after an accident. | **Lease and Loan Gap\nCoverage**  \nThis helps you pay off your car loan if your vehicle is totaled or stolen and\nthe amount you owe is more than the car's depreciated value. This coverage\ncomes standard in an Allstate Business Auto Insurance policy.  \n  \n## Download our agent discussion guide\n\nAs business owners themselves, Allstate agents have a unique understanding of\nthe needs and questions you may have when selecting an insurance plan.
