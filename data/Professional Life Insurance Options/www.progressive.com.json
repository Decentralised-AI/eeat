Insurance\n  3. Life Insurance\n\n## What is life insurance?\n\nPurchasing life insurance allows you to provide a safety net for your loved\nones in case you pass away. A life insurance policy is a contract stating\nthat, as long as your premium is paid and the policy is active when you die,\nyour beneficiaries can receive a death benefit payout to be used however they\nlike \u2014 for final expenses, paying off outstanding debt, and even everyday\ncosts.\n\n## Types of life insurance products\n\nLife insurance policies generally fall into three categories: term, permanent,\nand final expense. Once you understand the difference, you can easily\ndetermine which is right for your beneficiaries' needs and your budget.\n\n  * **Term policies** last a set timeframe (often 1, 10, 15, 20, or 30 years) and are affordable. They're typically for supporting your loved ones in case you pass away unexpectedly. In some states, we also offer a \"flexible term\" policy via Progressive Life Insurance Company \u2014 it allows you to adjust your coverage amount (up or down) without having to re-apply or get a new policy. \u2020Read the associated disclosure for this claim.\n  * **Permanent policies** last your entire lifetime, have cash value that grows, and are more expensive.\n  * **Final expense policies** are a more affordable type of permanent life insurance with a lower death benefit that's designed to cover your end-of-life costs.\n\nExplore the types of life insurance we offer.\n\n  * ### Term life insurance\u203a\n\n**Term**. Popular and affordable, traditional term life insurance is for\nprotecting your loved ones in case you pass while they still depend on your\nincome. Get coverage for 10, 15, 20, or 30 years.\n\n  * ### Final expense insurance\u203a\n\n**Final expense**. Also known as burial insurance, it's designed to cover your\nfuneral, health care bills, and other costs after you pass away. It's an\naffordable policy with no medical exam.\n\n  * ### Short-term life insurance\u203a\n\n**Term**. Starting out with life insurance or have a temporary need? This\nunique policy provides one year of inexpensive coverage. There's no medical\nexam so you can quickly get a policy online.\n\n  * ### Whole life insurance\u203a\n\n**Permanent**. The most popular permanent policy, whole life provides coverage\nfor your entire life at a fixed premium. Plus, it builds cash value at a fixed\nrate over time, which you can borrow from.\n\n  * ### Universal life insurance\u203a\n\n**Permanent**. Universal life lets you change your payment and death benefit\namount over time. Its cash value depends more on the market than whole life\nand can grow into a no-cost policy.\n\nSee more types See less types\n\n## Which life insurance policy is right for me?\n\nConsider your budget and your reasons for getting life insurance when\ndetermining which type of life policy is best for you. Do you want to make\nsure your income is replaced in case you die before you retire? Or do you need\ncoverage no matter when you pass? Explore these quick tips for narrowing down\nyour options.\n\nPOLICY TYPES\n\n### Term life\n\nTerm life insurance with a term of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years makes sense if:\n\n  * You support a partner, spouse, or children\n  * You're paying off debt, like a mortgage\n  * Your loved ones depend on your income\n\n **Example:** You're married, in your 20s, and a new homeowner with a 30-year\n$250,000 mortgage. You get a 30-year term life insurance policy with $250,000\nof coverage and name your spouse as the beneficiary. In case you pass away in\nthe next 30 years, they can use the death benefit to pay off the mortgage and\ncover other costs.\n\n### Final expense\n\nFinal expense or burial life insurance makes sense if:\n\n  * You're between 50 and 85 years old\n  * You want an affordable policy\n  * You only want your funeral and other final expenses covered\n\n **Example:** You're 55 and planning for your retirement years. You want to\nmake sure your loved ones don't have to pay for your burial and funeral costs\nwhen you pass away, so you estimate your final expenses and purchase an\naffordable policy for that amount.\n\n### Short-term (one year)\n\nOne year of term life insurance coverage makes sense if:\n\n  * You want to try out life insurance\n  * You only want temporary coverage\n  * You're in between jobs and temporarily without employer-provided coverage\n\n **Example:** You are 25, have a child, and aren't sure where to start with\nlife insurance. You decide to get one year of highly affordable coverage so\nyou can decide if you want to commit to a longer-term policy.\n\n### Whole life\n\nA permanent, whole life insurance policy makes sense if:\n\n  * You want to be covered no matter when you pass away\n  * You want the cash value feature and the option to take out a life insurance loan\n  * You want a fixed premium and hands-off cash value growth\n\n **Example:** You have long-term dependents that will rely on you until you\npass away, so you purchase whole life insurance to make sure they can claim\nthe death benefit no matter when you die.\n\n### Universal life\n\nA permanent, universal life insurance policy makes sense if:\n\n  * You want to be covered no matter when you pass away\n  * You want the potential of a zero-cost policy or an adjustable premium\n  * You want the benefit of cash value and can afford the higher fees and risks associate with universal life's cash value growth setup\n\n **Example:** You want to make sure your kids are covered even if you die well\ninto your senior years. While universal life has higher costs, fees, and risks\nthan whole life, you can afford it and you like the potential of an adjustable\npremium or a no-cost policy.\n\n## How much does life insurance cost?\n\nGenerally, the younger and healthier you are, the more affordable your life\ninsurance can be \u2014 starting at just $16 per month through Progressive Life by\neFinancial.*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. Coverage options\nbegin at $5,000 and go up to $2 million or more through eFinancial. Through\nProgressive Life Insurance Company, coverage options range from $50,000 to $1\nmillion.\n\nKeep in mind that permanent life policies generally cost more than term life\npolicies. And the longer a term policy lasts, the more you'll pay. Learn more\nabout how much life insurance costs and compare term life insurance rates\nthrough Progressive Life by eFinancial to find a policy that fits your needs\nand budget.\n\neFinancial works with highly rated life insurance companies to help bring you\ncompetitive rates and a variety of simplified life insurance options, such as\nRAPIDecision\u00ae Life \u2014 giving you the possibility to purchase life insurance\nwith no exam. Progressive Life Insurance Company also offers term life\npolicies that don't require a medical exam.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nAccording to the 2023 Insurance Barometer Study, over half of survey\nrespondents guessed that a 20-year, $250,000 term life insurance policy for a\nhealthy 30-year-old would cost $500 per year or more. But the average cost is\nactually much lower \u2014 under $200 per year. Case in point, don't put off buying\nlife insurance because you think it'll be too expensive. Get a quote and see\nfor yourself how affordable it can be.\n\n## Common questions about life insurance\n\n### How much life insurance do I need?\n\nAccording to eFinancial, a common recommendation is to carry life insurance\nwith a death benefit that's 7 to 10 times your annual income, but that doesn't\ntake into account your unique financial situation. Use our life insurance\ncalculator to get more precise with how much life insurance you need.\n\n### What age should you buy life insurance?\n\nGenerally, the younger you are the more affordable your coverage will be, but\nyou can find life insurance that fits your financial needs at almost any age.\nBesides age, you should consider buying life insurance if you have a family or\ndebt that your estate would be responsible for. Learn more about when to get\nlife insurance.\n\n### What does life insurance cover?\n\nYour beneficiaries can use the death benefit from your life insurance policy\nfor any expenses they have. Some common uses for these funds include paying\nfor funeral services, child tuition, mortgage payments, and other everyday\nexpenses that would be a considerable burden with the loss of your income.\nOthers may use their life insurance to leave an inheritance for their children\nand to settle any debt their estate holds once they pass away.\n\n### Are there any medical exams required to purchase a life insurance policy?\n\nInsurers typically require a medical exam when buying a traditional life\ninsurance policy. The exam allows them to evaluate your physical health and\nmedical history, determining the overall risk of issuing a life insurance\npolicy to you. However, there are other types of life insurance that don't\nrequire a medical exam , called simplified or guaranteed issue life insurance.\nThese may be a good option if you have health conditions that make you\nineligible for traditional life insurance.\n\n## Learn more about life insurance\n\nHave additional questions?
