Common Life Insurance Questions\n\n#  Common Life Insurance Questions\n\n## Let\u2019s answer some common questions about life insurance.\n\nLife insurance is a contract between an insurance policyholder and an insurer,\nwhere the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money in\nexchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person. Depending on the\ncontract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also\ntrigger payment. The policyholder typically pays a premium, either regularly\nor as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be\nincluded in the benefits. You can read more about life insurance on our\nwebsite **here**.\n\n###  **Do I really need life insurance?**\n\nA simple way to answer this is by asking: \u201cDo I have anyone dependent on my\nsalary to sustain their standard of living?\u201d In other words, if you were to\npass, would those still alive have issues covering the cost of your burial?\nCovering rent or mortgage payments and other bills? What about any remaining\nmedical costs? Would they have enough money to cover those and still maintain\ntheir normal life? If the answer to any of these is \u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d then\nyou should consider what life insurance options work best for you and your\nneeds.\n\n###  **How do I buy life insurance?  **\n\nRemember, only do business with a licensed and well-reviewed insurance agent\nor company. Once you have an insurance agent or company who you feel confident\ndoing business with:\n\n  * Decide how much coverage you need, for how long, and what you can afford to pay.\n  * Learn what kinds of policies will provide what you need and pick the one that is best for you. Visit our Choosing Life Insurance page for more details.\n  * Do not sign an application until you review it carefully to be sure the answers are complete and accurate.\n  * Do not buy life insurance unless you intend to stick with your plan. It may be very costly if you quit during the early years of the policy.\n  * Be sure to review your contract and understand exactly what is or isn\u2019t covered. You can review our blog post, Understanding Your Insurance Policy for more tips on how to do this.\n  * When you buy a policy, make the check payable to the company, not the agent.\n\n###  **What is the \u201cfree to look\u201d period?**\n\nIf you have just purchased a life insurance policy and then changed your mind\nabout it, express this right away to your agent as you may be in your \u201cfree to\nlook\u201d period. During this period, you are allowed no less than 10 days from\nthe date a life insurance policy was delivered to review and evaluate the\npolicy. A policy sold by mail order must provide a 30-day review period.\nShould you elect to return the policy for any reason during the \"free to look\"\nperiod, the insurance company must refund any premium you paid. ** **\n\n###  **Is it true that some companies won\u2019t turn applicants down?**\n\nIt\u2019s always important to make sure you understand **_what  _**a company is\nactually offering when they make these advertisements. Such ads are for\n\"guaranteed issue\" policies that ask no health history questions. The company\nknows it is taking a risk because people with bad health could buy their\npolicies. The company balances the risk by charging higher premiums or by\nlimiting the amount of insurance you can buy. The premiums can be almost as\nmuch as the insurance! After a few years, you could pay more to the insurance\ncompany than it will have to pay to your beneficiary. Such policies may offer\nonly the return of your premiums if you die within the first couple of years\nafter you buy the policy. So once again, it is very important that you\nunderstand what is covered and what is not, and how much it will cost you\nbefore signing on to any policy.\n\n###  **What\u2019s the difference between term and permanent life insurance?**\n\n **Term  **insurance generally has lower premiums than permanent policies.\nHowever, term life insurance does not build up cash value that you can use in\nthe future. Term covers you \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 for a term of one or more\nyears. If you die within that term, death benefits are paid out. You can renew\nmost term insurance policies for one or more terms, even if your health has\nchanged, though premiums may be higher. So be sure to ask your insurance agent\nor company if you will have this option to renew after the end of the term and\nif there is an age cut-off for renewals. You may also combine cash value life\ninsurance with term insurance for the period of your greatest need for life\ninsurance to replace income.  \n\n **Permanent  **insurance policies remain in place as long as the premium is\nbeing paid. They also all have a cash value that increases over time and\nallows the policyholder to borrow against that cash value. Because of the\nsavings element, the premiums for permanent insurance tend to be higher\ncompared to term insurance premiums. There are four types of permanent life\ninsurance: whole life, universal life, variable life, and variable universal\nlife. You can learn more about these different types of permanent life\ninsurance here, on our website.\n\n###  **What does \u201cfully paid up\u201d mean on a permanent life insurance policy?**\n\n\u201cFully paid up\u201d means, just that. You have made enough premium payments to\ncover the cost of insurance for the rest of your life.\n\n## Do you have a life insurance question that we didn\u2019t cover in this post?\n\nFeel free to reach out to our Office of Consumer Services or you can check out\nthis list of other frequently asked life insurance questions.\n\nThe Office of Consumer Services is open Monday-Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00\np.m. and Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Our representatives can be reached by\nphone at 803-737-6180 or toll-free at 1-800-768-3467.
