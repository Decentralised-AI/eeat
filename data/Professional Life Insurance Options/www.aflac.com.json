At Aflac, we want to help simplify your search and guide you toward\nfinding the life insurance policy that best fits your lifestyle.\n\nDepending on your coverage goals, your family size, your income, and financial\naspirations, there may be one type of life insurance more suited for your\nspecific needs than others. Let\u2019s dive deeper into how life insurance works,\nthe types of policies available, and how you can choose life insurance that\u2019s\nbest for you and your loved ones.\n\n## How Does Life Insurance Work?\n\nWhile there are various life insurance options, these plans tend to function\nsimilarly. Whether you have life insurance that lasts your entire life or just\n20 years, you must pay regular premiums in order to receive your benefits.\nMost life insurance plans have a benefit that is paid to the beneficiary when\nthe policyholder passes.\n\nDepending on the type of life insurance policy, there may be other benefits\navailable. Some life insurance plans offer benefits that can be used while the\npolicyholder is still alive. These benefits may come in the form of a cash\nvalue component that can be used to help cover medical expenses or everyday\ncosts of living.1\n\n## Types of Life Insurance\n\nEach life insurance plan is distinct, so it\u2019s crucial to understand the\ndifferent types of life insurance. Read on to discover which life insurance\noption may be best for you and your family.\n\n### Whole Life Insurance\n\nLike its name suggests, whole life insurance is a permanent coverage type that\nlasts your entire life. The benefit will be paid to your beneficiary whenever\nyou pass. This may be a more expensive option upfront, but the benefits can be\nmore secure in the long run.\n\nWhole life insurance may be the best type of coverage if you are looking for\nguaranteed support for your loved ones on any timeline. It may also be a wise\nmove if you are hoping to factor in long-term financial planning.\n\n### Term Life Insurance\n\nOn the other hand, term life insurance provides coverage for a set term or\nspecific amount of time. At Aflac, we offer multiple term lengths in 10, 20,\nand 30-year increments. This plan may be a more affordable route. However, the\npolicyholder must pass during the designated time frame of the plan for the\nbeneficiary to receive benefits.\n\nThere are additional term life insurance considerations to make as well. In\nsome cases, you may be able to extend the length of your term life insurance\npolicy if you outlive the time frame (subject to limitations and exclusions).\nThis depends on your history of payments and the established guidelines of the\ninsurance carrier. Many customers typically compare the costs and values\nbetween term and whole life insurance.\n\n### Universal Life Insurance\n\nUniversal life insurance works a bit differently than both term and whole life\ninsurance. It\u2019s a type of permanent policy that has an investment portion.\nThis portion, otherwise known as the cash value, can grow throughout the life\nof the policyholder. The growth takes place in a tax-deferred account at a\nstable rate.\n\nThis type of life insurance plan also allows for greater flexibility, as you\nmay be able to adjust the premium payments and benefit value over time.2\n\n### Group Life Insurance\n\nAs a business owner, it\u2019s important to make sure your employees feel safe and\nseen. Group life insurance is a great option if you are looking to provide\nbenefits for your employees or members of an organization. Aflac gives you the\nopportunity to offer your hard workers term or whole group life insurance\noptions.\n\n## Which Life Insurance Plan is Best for Me?\n\nHow much you are looking to spend on premium payments, how much coverage would\nyou like to secure for your family, and the access to cash benefits are all\nimportant determinants to consider when deciding what the life insurance\npolicy is best for you.\n\n###### Peace of mind doesn't  \nhave to break the bank\n\nDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Help cover yourself and your family with\naffordable coverage from Aflac.\n\nLearn More\n\n## How to Choose Life Insurance that\u2019s best\n\nEven after learning the differences between each type of plan, it can be\nconfusing to pick the life insurance policy that best meets your needs.\nTalking to an agent always helps, but there are also a few key factors that\ncan help you narrow down your decision.\n\n### Choose a Plan Type\n\nIf budgeting is your biggest concern, term life insurance may be the best\nchoice. If you have many dependents, whole life insurance may be a better\nroute. However, if financial planning and cash value are most important to\nyou, universal life insurance may be a strong option. Lastly, if you are a\nbusiness owner, group life insurance might be the best life insurance option.\n\n### Figure Out How Much Insurance You Need\n\nAssessing how many dependents you have can help clarify how much life\ninsurance coverage you need. You can reflect on what figure feels right and\ntalk to an agent about how to work this into your plan. The coverage options\nvary depending on what\u2019s offered in each different type of life insurance\nplan.\n\n### Compare Plan Features and Extra Benefits\n\nSome life insurance options have extra benefits that may make your plan\nworthwhile. For example, some insurance carriers offer long-term care riders\nthat can be added to life insurance plans. These types of riders allow\npolicyholders to access a portion of the policy\u2019s death benefit every month to\npay for long-term care costs.3\n\nWe recommend you determine which additional elements are non-negotiable for\nyour needs. If cash value is a top priority for you, your life insurance\noptions may start to slim down. Reading the fine print and understanding the\nbenefits within each plan can help tip the scale too.\n\n### Compare Quotes\n\nLastly, getting some numbers in front of you always helps paint a clearer\npicture.
