There are different types of life\ninsurance policies, but they all have one thing in common: they\u2019re designed to\npay money, usually as a lump sum, to your chosen beneficiaries in the event of\nyour death.\n\n## How Does Life Insurance Work?\n\nOnce you sign up for a policy and pay your premiums, life insurance companies\nagree to grant a payment known as a death benefit to beneficiaries once the\npolicyholder dies. Policyholders choose their beneficiaries, which can be one\nor more individuals, a trust, an estate or even an organization.\n\nSome types of policies will let you access a portion of your life insurance\nfunds while you are still alive if you\u2019re diagnosed with a terminal illness,\nprovided you have an insurance rider known as an accelerated death benefit.\nYou\u2019ll need to have evidence of a condition or situation that qualifies per\nyour life insurance contract.\n\n### What is a policyholder?\n\nThe policyholder is the person who purchased the life insurance policy. For\nindividual life insurance, the policyholder and the insured are one and the\nsame. If you have a group policy through your employer, you are the insured\nand your employer is the policyholder.\n\n### Life insurance payout options\n\nCommon life insurance payout options include:\n\n  * **Lump Sum Payout:** A lump sum payout allows the beneficiary to receive the entire death benefit at once. This is the most common form of disbursement for life insurance proceeds. It allows greater flexibility in how beneficiaries use it and isn\u2019t taxable.\n\n  * **Installments or Annuities:** With this option, the beneficiary regularly receives proceeds and accumulated interest over a period of time. Since interest income is subject to taxation, some people find they\u2019re better off getting a lump sum of money rather than being paid in installments, depending on how large the policy\u2019s death benefit is.\n\n  * **Retained Asset Account:** These work similarly to a checking account held by the insurer, with the initial balance being the death benefit. The beneficiary can write checks against the balance in the account and the amount deposited accrues interest over time. Unlike checking accounts, retained asset accounts do not allow deposits.\n\n## What can you pay with a life insurance death benefit?\n\nYour beneficiaries can use the payment from your life insurance for just about\nanything. Your survivors can use the funds to pay for final expenses, pay off\na mortgage or use it in the future to pay for college tuition. Providers pay\nout death benefits claims for natural and accidental deaths, as well as in\ncases of suicide or homicide. However, most policies have exceptions and\nexclusions, so make sure to learn what your policy will cover before you\npurchase.\n\n### Examples of what life insurance can pay for\n\nOnce disbursed, beneficiaries can use the money from the life insurance policy\nfor whatever they want. Typical uses include:\n\n  * Covering everyday expenses like groceries or household essentials\n  * Paying off a mortgage or other outstanding debt\n  * Covering burial costs or end-of-life medical care\n  * Putting someone through college or any other major education expenses\n  * Paying for child or dependent care or replacing care provided by a spouse\n\nThe payment from a life insurance policy may also function as a safety net by\nensuring that a family can stay in their home and pay for the things that were\nplanned before the policyholder\u2019s death.\n\n### What is a disclaimer?\n\nIn life insurance, a disclaimer refers to the act of disclaiming the proceeds\nof a policy. This happens when a beneficiary declines to receive or fails to\nclaim the death benefit. In such cases, the death benefit goes to the\nremaining beneficiaries. If there are no other beneficiaries, the death\nbenefit goes to the insured's estate.\n\n### What is a contestability period?\n\nThe first two years of your policy are typically considered a contestability\nperiod. The life insurance company can review your policy during this time and\nrefuse to pay a claim or rescind your policy if they find your application\ncontains inaccurate information or you have committed fraud.\n\n### When do providers pay out death claims?\n\nLife insurance companies must be contacted following the death of the insured\nindividual to begin the claims and payout process. So long as your policy is\nstill active at the time of your death and you\u2019ve paid your premiums on time,\nyour provider will most likely pay out.\n\n  * Natural causes, such as a heart attack, old age, or illnesses like cancer\n  * Accidental death, including accidental drug overdose\n  * Suicide, after the policy\u2019s suicide clause period ends\n  * Homicide, unless the beneficiary played a role in the murder\n\n### Common exclusions\n\nSpecific exclusions are often written into life insurance contracts to limit\nthe insurer\u2019s liability. If there\u2019s evidence of fraud, criminal activity, lack\nof payment or other specific situations, your beneficiaries might not receive\nthe policy\u2019s death benefit.\n\n  * **Expired policies:** Policies only stay active as long as you make your premium payments on time.\n\n  * **Fraud:** Your insurer can cancel your policy while you\u2019re alive or deny or reduce the benefit after your death if it finds out you lied on your application.\n\n  * **Criminal activity:** If you die while committing a crime (or your beneficiary committed a crime to access your insurance money), your insurer won\u2019t pay out.\n\n  * **Other exclusions** : Insurers typically exclude high-risk sports and hobbies from coverage. If you died while skydiving, for example, your insurer might not pay out.\n\n## Types of Life Insurance\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance: term and permanent coverage. A\nterm life insurance policy provides financial protection for a specific time.\nPermanent life insurance, such as whole or universal life, provides coverage\nthroughout your life as long as your premiums are paid.\n\n### Term life insurance\n\nThe most affordable type of life insurance policy is term life insurance, and\nit is widely available and easy to understand.\n\nThis type of policy is best for people with temporary financial obligations\nwho want coverage for a specified period or \u201cterm.\u201d This term is the period of\ntime during which the insurance policy is active and would pay out a death\nbenefit to the insured\u2019s beneficiaries. If the policyholder is alive by the\nend of the policy term, it will expire \u2014 unless it features the option to\nconvert it into a permanent policy.\n\n**Go for it**\n\n  * If you just need to replace your income or cover debts for a specific period, such as the duration of your mortgage\n\n**Skip it**\n\n  * If you have a child or relative who will depend on you for the long term\n\nTerm life premiums can cost as little as $35 a month. Coverage amounts can go\nup into the millions, and term lengths can span anywhere from a one-year\n(annually renewable policies) to 30 years.\n\nFor more in-depth information about term life insurance, take a look at our\nterm life insurance guide.\n\nAds by Money.

These policies stay active as long as the policyholder pays the\nmonthly premium payments and can offer a cash value component.\n\nA permanent life insurance policy can be whole or universal. The difference\nbetween the two is that whole life insurance has fixed premiums and guaranteed\ncash accumulation, while the premiums and returns for universal life insurance\ncan vary depending on different factors. This variability makes universal life\ninsurance typically more affordable.\n\n**Go for it**\n\n  * If you have a lot of disposable income and have exhausted other investment options\n\n**Skip it**\n\n  * If your financial situation is likely to change in the future\n\n#### Whole life insurance\n\nA whole life insurance policy is the most expensive type, as it guarantees\nyour beneficiaries a death benefit for the entirety of your life and offers\ncash value accumulation.\n\nOne of the main benefits of having a cash value component is that you can\nborrow against your whole life insurance policy. Some companies pay out\ndividends on whole life policies that can cover premium payments or purchase\nadditional coverage.\n\nFor more information, take a look at our guide to whole life insurance.\n\nAds by Money.

Click\nbelow to get started.\n\nView Rates\n\n#### Universal life insurance\n\nA universal life insurance policy is the most flexible type of permanent life\ninsurance because of its variable premiums. Policyholders can increase or\nreduce premiums at any time which will in turn, lower or increase their death\nbenefit. This flexibility also affects the policy\u2019s cash value \u2013 a savings\ncomponent that earns interest.\n\nUniversal life policies are subject to market fluctuations because the cash\nvalue component of universal life policies is invested in stocks or bonds.\n\nIn low-interest-rate environments, the cash value account won\u2019t grow as\nintended, and you may not be able to cover future premiums with those funds.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this type of policy, read our universal life insurance\nguide.\n\n#### No-exam life insurance\n\nMost life insurance companies require that applicants take a medical exam to\nassess the risk of insuring them and set a premium accordingly. No-exam life\ninsurance allows applicants to bypass this step, making the process more\nconvenient. However, because providers don't know how risky applicants are to\ninsure the premiums they charge tend to be higher.\n\nPolicies of this type include accelerated underwriting, simplified issue and\nguaranteed issue. The first two require that applicants answer a series of\nquestions about their health, family medical history, financial situation and\nlifestyle. Guaranteed issue does not require the applicant to answer\nquestions, but it does take into account the applicant\u2019s age.\n\nAds by Money.

If the answer is yes, consider including life insurance in your\nfinancial plan.\n\nPeople who could benefit from having life insurance include:\n\n  * **Parents with young children or special needs dependents** \\- Life insurance can ensure that children, especially those who require lifelong care, will have their needs met even after their parents die. The policy\u2019s death benefit can also be used to fund a special needs trust managed by a fiduciary for the child\u2019s benefit.\n\n  * **Older adults without savings** \\- Older adults who want to provide financial coverage for their families or caretakers but lack substantial savings can leave them a death benefit.\n\n  * **Young adults who want to lock in low rates** \\- Because age and health factor into life insurance premiums, younger adults are offered much more favorable rates.\n\n  * **Adults with private student loans** \\- Private student loan debt is transferred to cosigners if the borrower dies. Life insurance can ensure your loved ones don\u2019t get stuck paying off the rest of your debt.\n\n  * **Business owners** \\- Firms, companies, and organizations can purchase a life insurance policy on employees whose passing would create severe financial hardship for the company.\n\n### When should you get life insurance?\n\nIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about your life and long-term care\ninsurance needs.\n\nYou should consider buying life insurance when:\n\n  * You\u2019re young and healthy\n  * You reach certain life milestones, such as starting a family, planning your retirement, and buying a home or car (or otherwise accumulating debt)\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 20s and are already looking into life insurance policies,\ntake a look at the main steps to buying life insurance for young adults.\n\n#### Life insurance for income replacement\n\nIncome replacement is one of the main reasons to get life insurance. Life\ninsurance provides your loved ones with an additional source of income if you\nare no longer around to provide for them.\n\nThis is very important for people whose families depend on their income as\npart of their budget. Having life insurance means that you can make sure they\nhave the financial support they need to maintain the lifestyle they\u2019re used\nto, even after you die.\n\n#### Life insurance for final expenses\n\nOlder adults without any dependents might not need traditional life insurance\ncoverage. However, they still have to plan for their funeral, which can cost\nanywhere from $7,000-$10,000 \u2014 not including other end-of-life expenses such\nas medical bills.\n\nHowever, if that is your main concern, final expense (or burial) insurance\nmight be a better option. Take a look at our selection of the best life\ninsurance for seniors for other alternatives.\n\n#### Life insurance to cover debt\n\nIndividuals who are worried about passing on debt to their loved ones should\nconsider credit life insurance. Unlike traditional life insurance, this type\nof insurance is uniquely designed to pay off a borrower's debt after death.\n\nYou may receive an offer to take out a credit life policy after a major\npurchase, such as a home or expensive vehicle. The value of the policy will\ncorrespond to the value of the loan it's intended to pay off. Credit life\ninsurance is easier to qualify for than traditional life insurance but has\nlimited use and loses value if the outstanding debt it insures increases\nbeyond the death benefit of the policy.\n\n## How to Get Life Insurance\n\n### Determine your insurance needs\n\nThe first step in buying a life insurance policy is determining how much\ncoverage you\u2019ll need. Your policy\u2019s death benefit can help your family pay for\nyour funeral expenses and make up for your lost income. It can also be used to\npay off a mortgage or other debt.\n\nThere are several ways to determine how much life insurance to buy \u2014 some\npeople choose to multiply their income by 10 to arrive at a rough estimate,\nwhile others use the DIME method that accounts for debt, annual salary,\noutstanding mortgage and projected education costs for their children. A\nprofessional financial planner can help you decide on the right number.\n\n### Research insurance providers and get quotes\n\nTo be sure you\u2019re getting the lowest rate, it\u2019s a good idea to compare life\ninsurance carriers. Every company is different, and your specific policy will\ndepend on a number of factors like your age and medical history. You can\nrequest quotes from life insurance companies to get an idea of what your\npolicy would cost.\n\n### Complete an application and phone interview\n\nTo purchase life insurance, you\u2019ll need to complete an application that will\ninclude basic information like your address and Social Security number. You\nshould also be prepared to present several documents, such as proof of\nidentity, residency and income, as well as documents about your medical\nhistory (unless you opt for a no-exam life insurance policy).\n\nSome companies may require a phone interview after you submit your\napplication. Your interviewer will want to verify the details you submitted\nand may ask additional questions about your family health history, your\nfinancial situation, and your lifestyle and hobbies.\n\n### Check the eligibility requirements\n\nThe eligibility criteria required to buy life insurance vary from company to\ncompany. However, there are two main requirements that nearly every company\nwill ask for when you apply.\n\n#### **Medical checkup**\n\nUnless you are applying for a no-exam life insurance policy, you\u2019ll be asked\nto undergo a medical exam before taking out a life insurance policy.\n\n#### Documents\n\nTo complete the application of a term insurance policy, the policyholder must\npresent all the needed documents. The documents required are:\n\n  * **Proof of identity citizenship, and age** \\- Drivers license, birth certificate or valid passport. Noncitizen residents may use their green card.\n\n  * **Proof of residency** \\- For renters: signed lease or a rent receipt. For homeowners: mortgage bill or a property tax statement. A utility bill or a postmarked envelope is also acceptable.\n\n  * **Proof of income** \\- Pay stubs, letter of employment, income tax return or an earnings statement from your bank. If unemployed: an unemployment letter or monthly statement.\n\n  * **Social Security number** \\- Used for preliminary background checks into the applicant\u2019s medical history, driving record and credit reports as well as criminal record if the applicant has one.\n\n### Wait for underwriting\n\nAfter you complete your application and phone interview, an underwriter for\nthe life insurance company will review your materials and decide if you\u2019re\neligible for coverage. The process could take several weeks. If you\u2019re\neligible, the underwriter will also determine your monthly premium.\n\n### How to choose a life insurance beneficiary\n\nWhen taking out a life insurance policy, choosing a beneficiary is one of the\nmost important choices the policyholder will be asked to make. A beneficiary\ncan be a spouse, parent, sibling, children, trust, estate, business partner or\ncharity organization.\n\nIn addition to naming multiple beneficiaries, policyholders can also name\nsecondary beneficiaries. The policy\u2019s death benefit will be passed on to them\nif your primary beneficiary cannot claim it.\n\nMake sure to update your beneficiaries as you undergo major life events to\nensure that the payout doesn\u2019t go to the wrong person or your estate. If the\nlatter occurs, a court reviews a will, if there is one, and appoints an\nexecutor who will administer the assets of the estate.\n\n### What is the process for a beneficiary to make a claim?\n\nTo file a life insurance claim and collect benefits, your beneficiary will\nneed to submit your death certificate to the insurance company along with a\nclaim form with information contained on the policy document. They may also\nneed to provide documents to verify their identity. After the beneficiary\nsubmits all the necessary documents, the insurance company can process the\nclaim and send the payout.\n\nAds by Money.

These prices are the estimated\npremium for a $500,000 policy for a 35-year-old man.\n\n### How much life insurance do I need?\n\nYou\u2019ll need a benefit that\u2019s large enough to cover your current and future\nfinancial obligations if you die. A common method is to multiply your income\nby 10, so if you earn $50,000 per year, you would ideally purchase a policy\nthat has a death benefit of $500,000. However, this equation doesn\u2019t take into\naccount your full financial picture. In the end, the amount of money you need\nwill depend on what you wish to cover and what you want your beneficiaries to\nreceive.\n\nWhile multiplying your income is a good starting point, adding expenses and\ndebts to the formula helps you account for your beneficiaries\u2019 needs and\nlifestyle. Therefore, many experts believe in using the DIME method.\n\nDIME is an acronym for debt, income, mortgage and education and it\u2019s broken\ndown as follow:\n\n  * **Debt:** Put down any loan under your name, such as car loans, personal loans, medical debt, credit card balances and your student loans.\n\n  * **Income:** Multiply your annual salary by the amount of time you want the insurance benefit to replace it. A basic number is 10, but you can go higher especially if you\u2019re younger because your income stands to increase as your career progresses.\n\n  * **Mortgage:** This is possibly the largest debt to your name and having your life insurance benefit cover the remaining balance would lift a huge burden off your beneficiaries\u2019 shoulders.\n\n  * **Education:** Add an estimate of how much tuition, room and board will cost for your child or children.\n\nAnother expense you can add to the equation are final expenses. This includes\nthe cost of funeral arrangements, casket, burial, embalming or cremation and\nthe burial plot and headstone. Know that you have the option of purchasing a\nseparate final expense insurance policy.\n\nIf you feel the base number you get after adding up your DIME is too high, you\ncan round out the equation by subtracting current life insurance, 401ks, 529\ncollege funds and other assets and tax-deferred savings.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that you can always use a life insurance calculator or consult a\nfinancial professional for help determining your life insurance needs. We also\nsuggest you look at all options along with your dependents or beneficiaries so\nyou can choose a policy and limits that works for everyone.\n\n#### What affects life insurance premiums\n\nMany factors affect the cost of life insurance premiums. It mostly comes down\nto the following factors:\n\n  * **Age** : Older policyholders are seen as having a higher risk. When you buy a life insurance policy, the older you are, the more expensive it\u2019ll be.\n\n  * **Gender** : Men and women tend to pay different rates for all types of insurance. Men can expect to pay more for life insurance due to a shorter life expectancy.\n\n  * **Cigarette use** : Because smokers are more likely to develop significant health issues, they require more coverage and will always pay a higher rate than non-smokers.\n\n  * **Weight** : Life insurance companies may charge more for individuals with a higher BMI.\n\n  * **Health** : Health concerns directly correlate to higher life insurance premiums. Pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease might make it more difficult for you to get life insurance at an affordable rate \u2014 or at all.\n\n  * **Lifestyle** : Frequently engaging in hazardous activities, such as skydiving or rock climbing, may increase the cost of your premiums.\n\nOther elements that influence how much a life insurance policy costs are the\npolicy type and the amount of coverage. Longer-lasting policies tend to have\nhigher premiums, because the risk of death increases as people age. Premiums\nare also tied to the amount of coverage; the more coverage you get, the higher\nyour premiums will be.\n\n## Life Insurance FAQs\n\n### Can I get life insurance with a pre-existing condition?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nIt's not impossible to get life insurance with a pre-existing condition like\ncancer, high blood pressure or diabetes, but it will be more difficult and\nmore expensive. You can also look into no-exam or guaranteed issue life\ninsurance.\n\n### At what age should I buy life insurance?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nWhile there's no specific age that's ideal for buying life insurance, experts\nagree that it's best to begin the process when you're young and healthy. Major\nlife milestones like having children, retirement planning or buying a home are\nalso good times to consider taking out a policy.\n\n### How do I choose the right life insurance policy?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nLife insurance policies vary according to your individual circumstances, and\nthere's no one-size-fits-all solution that's best for everyone. When choosing\na life insurance policy, you should consider your age, dependents and\nfinancial situation.\n\n### Can I change my life insurance policy later on?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nIf your needs change, it's possible to amend your life insurance policy after\nyou take it out. You can change the amount of coverage or beneficiaries, for\ninstance, or switch to a longer or shorter term. The best way to do this is to\ncontact your insurance company or agent directly.\n\nIf it's not possible to change your current policy to suit your needs, you can\nalso switch policies \u2014 but keep in mind you may need to complete a new\napplication and medical assessment.\n\n### Is life insurance taxable?\n\nchevron-down\n\nchevron-up\n\nIn general, life insurance payouts are not taxable. But interest that accrues\non the benefit money \u2014 such as in an annuity account \u2014 could be subject to\ntaxes. There are also exceptions if the policy's beneficiary is an estate.\n\n## Life Insurance Key Takeaways\n\n  * Life insurance is a contract between you, the policy owner, and an insurance company. In exchange for a monthly premium payment, the insurer will pay your beneficiaries a death benefit in the event of your passing.\n\n  * Term, Whole, Universal, and No-exam are the most common life insurance policies.\n\n  * Term life insurance is more affordable and easier to understand but has an expiration date.\n\n  * Insurers require proof of residency, income and other documentation and a medical exam (for most policies).\n\n  * Age, gender, cigarette use, health, lifestyle, family medical history, and driving record affect your life insurance premiums.\n\n  * Depending on what you expect your death benefit to be used for, you\u2019ll need more or less coverage. For example, a life insurance policy meant to replace your income should probably be larger than one meant for final expenses.\n\n  * Under no circumstances should you lie in your life insurance application. Doing so could result in your policy being voided altogether.\n\n### Life Insurance related articles:\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence about what type of life insurance policy is best\nfor you, check out our comparison between term and whole life policies.\n\nLife insurance can be even more difficult to navigate for the transgender\ncommunity \u2014 check out our Guide to Life Insurance for Transgender People for\nessential information on how to make the process easier. .\n\nChoosing the right insurance company is one of the most important decisions\nyou\u2019ll make regarding life insurance.
