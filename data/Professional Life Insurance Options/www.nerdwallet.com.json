Within the consumer experience category, we consider ease of\ncommunication and website transparency, which looks at the depth of policy\ndetails available online. To calculate each insurer\u2019s rating, we adjusted the\nscores to a curved 5-point scale.\n\nThese ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare\nseveral insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not\nreceive compensation for any reviews.\n\nHow we review life insurance companies\n\nIn our life insurance reviews, our editorial team considers the customer and\nthe insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:\n\nPolicies offered. There are many types of life insurance on the market, and\nthey fall into three key categories:\n\n  * Term life insurance offers temporary coverage and a guaranteed payout if the policyholder dies during the term.\n\n  * Permanent life insurance typically lasts a lifetime and builds cash value that can be borrowed against in the future.\n\n  * No-exam life insurance issues coverage without the need for a medical exam.\n\nFinancial strength. We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer\u2019s long-term\nfinancial stability and ability to pay claims. For life insurance, NerdWallet\ntypically recommends considering insurers with ratings of A- or higher. Here\u2019s\nthe breakdown:\n\n  * Exceptional: A+, A++.\n\n  * Strong: A-, A.\n\n  * Moderate: B, B+.\n\nComplaints. These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative\nto a company\u2019s size, according to three years\u2019 worth of data from the National\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. The best life insurance companies have\nfewer than the expected number of complaints.\n\nBuy online. This indicates whether an insurer allows you to apply for and buy\na policy completely online.\n\nDive deeper: Ratings methodology for life insurance\n\n\u00bb MORE: Compare life insurance quotes\n\n## Best term life insurance policies for 2024\n\nLearn more about each company and the policies available by reading the brief\nsummaries below and checking out the full NerdWallet reviews.\n\n  * Guardian Life: Best for applicants living with HIV\n\n  * MassMutual: Best for low-income parents\n\n  * Northwestern Mutual: Best for customer experience\n\n  * New York Life: Best for high coverage amounts\n\n  * Pacific Life: Best for conversion flexibility\n\n  * State Farm: Best for customer satisfaction\n\n  * AARP: Best for older applicants\n\n* * *\n\nBest for applicants living with HIV\n\n## Guardian Life\n\n5.0\n\nNerdWallet rating\n\nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

For that reason, it\u2019s important to choose a\ncompany you can trust. Here are some ways to compare companies and find the\none that\u2019s best for you.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Life insurance reviews\n\n### Look up the insurer\u2019s financial strength\n\nYou want a company that will be around decades from now, with enough money to\npay claims. The financial strength rating of a life insurance company is one\nway to gauge whether an insurer is likely to meet that mark. You can check the\nfinancial strength rating of each term life insurance company you\u2019re\nconsidering through a rating firm such as AM Best.\n\nNerdWallet typically recommends considering insurers with ratings of A- or\nhigher. That said, any company with an AM Best rating of B+ or higher has a\n\"good\" ability to meet its obligations, according to AM Best\u2019s website.\nCompanies with ratings below that may not be quite as safe a bet and often\nhave higher rates of complaints relative to their size.\n\nAll of the largest life insurance companies have solid financial strength\nratings.\n\n### Research the insurer\u2019s reputation for customer service\n\nYou want a company that provides good customer service, from the day you start\nshopping until it\u2019s time for a claim. To get an idea of whether other\ncustomers have been satisfied, you can look up an insurer\u2019s complaint index on\nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners website. The score is\nbased on the number of complaints filed against the insurance company with\nstate regulators, adjusted for the company\u2019s market share (based on premiums\nwritten). The average score is one, so anything higher than one means the\ncompany received more complaints than expected for its size.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve narrowed down your list, it\u2019s a good idea to compare life\ninsurance quotes from more than one company. That way, you can get the best\nrate for the type of term life policy you're looking for.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Best life insurance companies\n\n## More about term life insurance\n\nLearn more about term life insurance, and find the right policy for your\ncoverage needs.\n\nWhat is term life insurance?

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches\nconclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are\ndetermined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life\ninsurance.\n\nAbout the author\n\nGeorgia Rose\n\nFollow\n\nYou\u2019re following Georgia Rose  \nVisit your My NerdWallet Settings page to see all the writers you're\nfollowing.\n\nnew\n\nFollow for more nerdy know-how\n\nKeep up with your favorite financial topics on NerdWallet.\n\nGeorgia Rose is a lead writer for NerdWallet and oversees our content on\nshopping for life insurance.
