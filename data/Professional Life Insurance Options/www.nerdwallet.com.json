Within the consumer experience category, we consider ease of\ncommunication and website transparency, which looks at the depth of policy\ndetails available online. To calculate each insurer\u2019s rating, we adjusted the\nscores to a curved 5-point scale.\n\nThese ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare\nseveral insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not\nreceive compensation for any reviews.\n\nHow we review life insurance companies\n\nIn our life insurance reviews, our editorial team considers the customer and\nthe insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:\n\nPolicies offered. There are many types of life insurance on the market, and\nthey fall into three key categories:\n\n  * Term life insurance offers temporary coverage and a guaranteed payout if the policyholder dies during the term.\n\n  * Permanent life insurance typically lasts a lifetime and builds cash value that can be borrowed against in the future.\n\n  * No-exam life insurance issues coverage without the need for a medical exam.\n\nFinancial strength. We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer\u2019s long-term\nfinancial stability and ability to pay claims. For life insurance, NerdWallet\ntypically recommends considering insurers with ratings of A- or higher. Here\u2019s\nthe breakdown:\n\n  * Exceptional: A+, A++.\n\n  * Strong: A-, A.\n\n  * Moderate: B, B+.\n\nComplaints. These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative\nto a company\u2019s size, according to three years\u2019 worth of data from the National\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. The best life insurance companies have\nfewer than the expected number of complaints.\n\nBuy online. This indicates whether an insurer allows you to apply for and buy\na policy completely online.\n\nDive deeper: Ratings methodology for life insurance\n\n\u00bb MORE: Compare life insurance quotes\n\n## Best term life insurance policies for 2024\n\nLearn more about each company and the policies available by reading the brief\nsummaries below and checking out the full NerdWallet reviews.\n\n  * Guardian Life: Best for applicants living with HIV\n\n  * MassMutual: Best for low-income parents\n\n  * Northwestern Mutual: Best for customer experience\n\n  * New York Life: Best for high coverage amounts\n\n  * Pacific Life: Best for conversion flexibility\n\n  * State Farm: Best for customer satisfaction\n\n  * AARP: Best for older applicants\n\n* * *\n\nBest for applicants living with HIV\n\n## Guardian Life\n\n5.0\n\nNerdWallet rating\n\nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

For that reason, it\u2019s important to choose a\ncompany you can trust. Here are some ways to compare companies and find the\none that\u2019s best for you.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Life insurance reviews\n\n### Look up the insurer\u2019s financial strength\n\nYou want a company that will be around decades from now, with enough money to\npay claims. The financial strength rating of a life insurance company is one\nway to gauge whether an insurer is likely to meet that mark. You can check the\nfinancial strength rating of each term life insurance company you\u2019re\nconsidering through a rating firm such as AM Best.\n\nNerdWallet typically recommends considering insurers with ratings of A- or\nhigher. That said, any company with an AM Best rating of B+ or higher has a\n\"good\" ability to meet its obligations, according to AM Best\u2019s website.\nCompanies with ratings below that may not be quite as safe a bet and often\nhave higher rates of complaints relative to their size.\n\nAll of the largest life insurance companies have solid financial strength\nratings.\n\n### Research the insurer\u2019s reputation for customer service\n\nYou want a company that provides good customer service, from the day you start\nshopping until it\u2019s time for a claim. To get an idea of whether other\ncustomers have been satisfied, you can look up an insurer\u2019s complaint index on\nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners website. The score is\nbased on the number of complaints filed against the insurance company with\nstate regulators, adjusted for the company\u2019s market share (based on premiums\nwritten). The average score is one, so anything higher than one means the\ncompany received more complaints than expected for its size.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve narrowed down your list, it\u2019s a good idea to compare life\ninsurance quotes from more than one company. That way, you can get the best\nrate for the type of term life policy you're looking for.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Best life insurance companies\n\n## More about term life insurance\n\nLearn more about term life insurance, and find the right policy for your\ncoverage needs.\n\nWhat is term life insurance?

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches\nconclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC.

It can protect businesses against the following kinds of claims,\nincluding covering legal and settlement costs:\n\n  * Professional negligence or failure to meet a standard of care. Say an architecture firm designs a branch for a local bank. A year later, the bank is sued by a customer because the branch\u2019s bathrooms aren\u2019t compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. The bank could sue the architecture firm for failing to adhere to professional standards. Read more about architect insurance.\n\n  * Failure to deliver a promised service on time. Say a manufacturing plant hires an IT consultant to handle a cybersecurity upgrade. The consultant promises it\u2019ll be finished by the end of the year, but they can\u2019t stick to that timeline. In January \u2014 after the project was supposed to be completed, according to the contract \u2014 the plant gets hacked. The plant could sue the consultant to recoup the costs of recovering from the security breach. Read more about professional liability insurance for consultants.\n\n  * Breach of contract. If an insurance agency\u2019s contract says it will help clients settle claims but, when the time comes, it doesn\u2019t have enough staff to provide that service, clients could claim that the agency violated that contract.

For instance, if a nurse administers the wrong dosage of a medication to a patient, they could be sued by that patient or their family. Read more about how much medical malpractice insurance costs.\n\n  * General professional misconduct. If a college professor routinely grades one student harder than their peers and that student can\u2019t graduate on time, that student or their parents might file a claim against the educator.\n\nProfessional liability insurance protects your business regardless of whether\nlegal claims are found to have merit. Your policy can pay out in case of\nfrivolous lawsuits as well as substantiated ones.\n\nUnlike some other types of liability insurance, professional liability\npolicies generally protect against claims of financial losses, not bodily\ninjury or property damage. Medical malpractice insurance is an exception to\nthat rule, though, as are policies for architects and engineers.\n\nShop Now\n\non Tivly's website\n\nOr call 888-698-3034  \n  \n---  \n  \n## What isn\u2019t covered by professional liability insurance?\n\nProfessional liability doesn't protect a business against:\n\n  * Bodily injury or property damage that customers or clients suffer while you\u2019re doing business; for instance, if they trip and fall in your office or if their personal files are destroyed in a fire. Those are general liability insurance claims.\n\n  * Lawsuits filed by employees with allegations like wrongful termination or workplace harassment. For those, a business will need employment practices liability insurance.\n\n  * Fraud or criminal action. If you or one of your employees commits a crime or intentionally misleads a client, the resulting professional liability claim isn\u2019t covered.\n\n## Who needs professional liability insurance?\n\nAnyone who provides professional services or advice to clients for a fee faces\nthe risks that professional liability insurance protects against.

This kind of professional liability insurance specifically protects\nphysicians, dentists, nurses, psychologists and other medical professionals\nagainst claims that they made a mistake that led to a patient\u2019s injury or\ndeath.\n\nProfessional liability insurance may be required in other fields as well. For\nexample, state licensing bodies may require lawyers to carry legal malpractice\ninsurance or to tell clients whether or not they have it.\n\n## How much is professional liability insurance?\n\nThe median cost of professional liability insurance is $59 per month,\naccording to online insurance marketplace Insureon, but prices can vary. For\ninstance, new Progressive insurance customers paid a median of $42 per month\nin 2021, according to that company.\n\nThe cost of professional liability insurance depends on:\n\n  * How common lawsuits are in your industry.\n\n  * The location where you work and how common claims are there.\n\n  * How much coverage you need.\n\n  * How many employees you have.\n\n  * How long you\u2019ve been in business.\n\n  * What kind of claims, if any, you\u2019ve filed in the past.\n\nThe best way to find out how much professional liability insurance will cost\nfor your business is to get a quote.\n\n## How to find the best professional liability insurance\n\nIn general, all major insurance companies offer professional liability or\nerrors and omissions insurance.

Ratings are based on weighted\naverages of scores in several categories, including financial strength,\ncustomer complaint data, shopping experience and customer service. Learn more\nabout how we rate small-business insurance companies.\n\nThese ratings are a guide, but insurance policy details and prices can vary\nwidely from business to business and provider to provider. We encourage you to\nshop around and compare several insurance quotes.\n\nNerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial\nguidelines.\n\n### Insurer complaints methodology\n\nNerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and\nreported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2018-2021.\n\nTo assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint\nindex each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints\nrelative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate\na company\u2019s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each\ninsurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year\nperiod.\n\nOur star ratings consider ratios for both general liability insurance and\ncommercial property insurance. When an insurer sells policies that are\nunderwritten by several different insurance companies, we consider the NAIC\ncomplaint ratios of all the underwriters.\n\nOn a similar note...\n\nBusiness Owner\u2019s Policy (BOP): What It Covers, How to Get It\n\nWhat Is Workers\u2019 Compensation?\n\nLLC Insurance: Best Options for Your Business in 2023\n\nHow to Get Business Insurance for Home-Based Businesses\n\nDive even deeper in Small Business\n\n### Best Small-Business Insurance 2023: Compare Companies and Coverage\n\nby Rosalie Murphy\n\nRead more\n\n### How to Get Business Insurance: The Ultimate 4-Step Guide\n\nby Randa Kriss\n\nRead more\n\n### How Much Does Business Insurance Cost?\n\nby Kelsey Sheehy\n\nRead more\n\n* * *\n\nExplore Small Business\n\nNerdWallet Home Page\n\nFinance smarter\n\nBankingCredit ScoreCheckingSavingsPrepaid Debit CardsMoney TransferCDs\n\nCredit CardsCredit Card BasicsStudent Credit CardsCash Back Credit\nCardsAirline Credit CardsLow Interest and No Fee Credit Cards\n\nFinancial PlanningPaying off debtCollege SavingsMaking Money\n\nFinancial News\n\nInsuranceAuto InsuranceHomeowners InsuranceLife InsuranceMedicareRenters\nInsurancePet Insurance\n\nInvestingRetirement PlanningRoth IRAEstate PlanningBrokers401k\n\nLoansAuto LoansStudent Loans\n\nMortgagesMortgage RatesMortgage ProcessHomeownershipHomeownership CostsSelling\nYour HomeHome AffordabilityProperty Taxes\n\nSmall BusinessRunning Your BusinessSmall-Business LoansBusiness Credit\nCardsSmall-Business TaxesStarting a Business\n\nTaxesIncome TaxesInvestment TaxesPersonal Taxes\n\nTravelVacations & Trip PlanningReward OptimizationsRental CarsTravel Insurance\n\nBanking\n\nExplore Banking\n\nCredit Score\n\nChecking\n\nSavings\n\nPrepaid Debit Cards\n\nMoney Transfer\n\nCDs\n\nCredit Cards\n\nExplore Credit Cards\n\nCredit Card Basics\n\nStudent Credit Cards\n\nCash Back Credit Cards\n\nAirline Credit Cards\n\nLow Interest and No Fee Credit Cards\n\nFinancial Planning\n\nExplore Financial Planning\n\nPaying off debt\n\nCollege Savings\n\nMaking Money\n\nFinancial News\n\nExplore Financial News\n\nInsurance\n\nExplore Insurance\n\nAuto Insurance\n\nHomeowners Insurance\n\nLife Insurance\n\nMedicare\n\nRenters Insurance\n\nPet Insurance\n\nInvesting\n\nExplore Investing\n\nRetirement Planning\n\nRoth IRA\n\nEstate Planning\n\nBrokers\n\n401k\n\nLoans\n\nExplore Loans\n\nAuto Loans\n\nStudent Loans\n\nMortgages\n\nExplore Mortgages\n\nMortgage Rates\n\nMortgage Process\n\nHomeownership\n\nHomeownership Costs\n\nSelling Your Home\n\nHome Affordability\n\nProperty Taxes\n\nSmall Business\n\nExplore Small Business\n\nRunning Your Business\n\nSmall-Business Loans\n\nBusiness Credit Cards\n\nSmall-Business Taxes\n\nStarting a Business\n\nTaxes\n\nExplore Taxes\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nInvestment Taxes\n\nPersonal Taxes\n\nTravel\n\nExplore Travel\n\nVacations & Trip Planning\n\nReward Optimizations\n\nRental Cars\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nabout\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nCareers\n\nCorporate impact\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nEditorial guidelines\n\nStar rating methodologies\n\nEditorial team\n\nNews\n\nPress kit\n\nInvestors\n\nhelp\n\nHelp center\n\nSupport team\n\nCommunity\n\nSecurity FAQs\n\nlegal\n\nTerms of use\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nCalifornia privacy policy\n\nPrivacy preferences\n\nDo not sell or share my personal information\n\nDownload the app\n\nLearn more about the app\n\nDisclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to\ndate.
