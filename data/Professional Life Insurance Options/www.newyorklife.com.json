Once you decide how\nmuch life insurance you need, you can choose from several options and even\ncombine different products.\n\nConnect with an agent\n\n## Life insurance products can help you achieve different goals\n\nWhether you need short- or long-term protection, we can help you find the life\ninsurance policy that fits your budget and offers the financial benefits you\nwant.\n\n* * *\n\n###  Financial protection for your family\n\nAll life insurance policies offer a guaranteed death benefit, a payout to your\nloved ones if you pass away.

Variable universal life insurance, another lifetime option, can grow in\nvalue through investments\u200b\u200b, although market risk is involved.\n\n* * *\n\n###  Flexibility to adapt to changing needs\n\nUniversal life insurance ** ** offers long-term coverage that\u2019s \u200b\u200bflexible in\nterms of the timing and amount of premiums paid (within limits). You can\nadjust your payments (premiums) and benefits when your needs change.\n\n* * *\n\n###  Long-term wealth accumulation\n\nTackling multiple goals at once, accumulation-focused life insurance helps you\ntackle multiple goals at once. You can protect your loved ones while building\nwealth for long-term needs such as retirement.\n\n## Compare different life insurance types\n\n##  COMPARE YOUR LIFE INSURANCE OPTIONS\n\n|\n\nYour payments **** (premiums)\n\n|\n\nPayout for loved ones (death benefit)\n\n|\n\nBuilds\n\ncash value\n\n|\n\nGuaranteed cash value growth\n\n|\n\nPotential earnings (dividends1)\n\n|\n\nMarket growth potential and/or risk\n\n|\n\nMay go from term to permanent  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nTerm life insurance\n\n|\n\nGradually increase after a certain period\n\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  \n  \nWhole life insurance\n\n|\n\nAlways the same amount\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|  |  \n  \nUniversal life insurance\n\n|\n\nCan be adjusted\n\n|\n\n|\n\nIn some cases\n\n|\n\nGuaranteed minimum interest credited\n\n|  |  |  \n  \nVariable universal life insurance\n\n|\n\nCan be adjusted\n\n|\n\n|\n\nIn most cases (market risk)\n\n|  |  |\n\n|  \n  \nAccumulation- focused life insurance\n\n|\n\nConsistent amounts, ending after a specified period\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nSecure Wealth Plus\n\n|\n\nSecure Wealth Plus\n\n|\n\nMarket Wealth Plus\n\n|  \n  \nSee a detailed comparison of whole vs term life\n\n## Common questions about life insurance\n\n###  What is life insurance?\n\nLife insurance is a policy (or, a contract between you and an insurance\ncompany) that provides financial protection for your family. If you pass away,\nyour policy will pay cash (death benefit) to your loved ones. Many families\nuse this money to cover funeral costs, make up for lost income, or build\nwealth by leaving money for the next generation. Working with a New York Life\nagent, you can choose between a temporary option like term life insurance or\nsomething permanent like whole life insurance. We also offer universal life\ninsurance, which has some flexibility in terms of the timing and amount of\npremiums paid, and variable universal life, which gives you the option to\ninvest in the markets.\n\n###  Do I need life insurance?\n\nNo matter where you are today, life insurance is a valuable tool to help\nprotect what\u2019s important to you, now and in the future. All life insurance\npolicies, including term life insurance, provide a cash payment (death\nbenefit) that helps to support your family financially if you pass away. Long-\nterm options such as universal life and variable universal life insurance also\nhave cash value that you can use during your lifetime for things like a down\npayment on a house or supplemental retirement income. (Accessing the cash\nvalue will reduce the available cash surrender value and death benefit.) With\npermanent whole life insurance, the cash value is guaranteed to grow over\ntime, helping you to also build wealth for future generations. Connect with an\nagent to discuss the best options for you.\n\n###  How much life insurance do I need?\n\nThe right amount of life insurance coverage for you may depend on many\nfactors, including your budget, your family situation, your needs, and your\ngoals for the future. Connect with an agent who can help you determine the\nmost important considerations for you, along with possible solutions.\n\n###  Do I need life insurance if I\u2019m covered by my employer?\n\nIt can be a nice benefit to have life insurance that\u2019s offered through, and\npossibly funded by, your workplace. The downside is that your life insurance\nends if you leave your job. You may also have fewer coverage options from\nwhich to choose. When you buy individual life insurance (either to replace\nemployer-sponsored life insurance or in addition to it) you hold onto that\npolicy for as long as you continue making payments. Connect with an agent to\nlearn more about individual life insurance options.\n\n## Learn more about life insurance\n\nARTICLE\n\n###  The differences between term and permanent life insurance\n\nRead article\n\nARTICLE\n\n###  6 reasons to buy life insurance\n\nRead article\n\nARTICLE\n\n###  Life insurance 101\n\nRead article\n\nARTICLE\n\n###  Should I get life insurance in my 20s?\n\nRead article\n\n## Which type of life insurance policy is right for you?\n\nWe can help you clarify your needs and goals\n\nSelect all topics you would like to discuss\n\nLife insurance\n\nRetirement planning\n\nSaving and investing\n\nEstate planning\n\nNot sure\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nEmail*\n\nPhone Number*\n\nAddress (street, apt, bldg., etc.)*\n\nCity*\n\nState*\n\nSelectAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict\nOf\nColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew\nHampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth\nDakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth\nDakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyoming\n\nZip Code*\n\nDate of Birth*\n\nThis helps us understand your immediate needs.\n\nJoin our email list to stay in the know about the best ways to prepare for\nyour future.\n\nadobeVisitorId\n\nscid\n\ntid\n\nreferrerUrl\n\nSubmit\n\n*Required\n\n_New York Life Variable Universal Life Accumulator II and Market Wealth Plus\nvariable universal life are sold only by prospectus.
