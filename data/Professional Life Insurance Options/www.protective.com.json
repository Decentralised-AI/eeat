You might consider\nlayering policies to have more coverage at certain times \u2014 such as when you\nhave children at home or when you\u2019re starting a business.\n\n__\n\n## Life insurance trigger events to consider\n\nNew job\n\nEmployer-provided life insurance can't always go with you, but a personal\npolicy will not be dependent upon your employment status.\n\nHome purchase\n\nTaking on a mortgage means you need to evaluate whether you have enough\ncoverage to offset this new debt.\n\nMarriage or divorce\n\nFrom reviewing the amount of coverage to changing beneficiaries, marriage or\ndivorce is a critical time to reevaluate your life insurance needs.\n\nBaby\n\nMore kids likely means you need more coverage. You'll want to plan for your\nchild's future financial needs.\n\nNew business\n\nCovering a business owner can allow for a smooth transition if the worst\nhappens.\n\nRetirement\n\nYou may find that life insurance becomes less about insuring your income and\nmore about protecting assets as you near retirement.\n\n## Common questions about life insurance\n\n1\n\nWhat is life insurance?\n\nLife insurance is a contract with an insurance company to purchase a lump sum\npayment (death benefit) to be dispersed to a beneficiary when the insured\ndies. The primary types of life insurance are whole (permanent lifetime\ncoverage) and term (coverage for a certain number of years).\n\nHow does life insurance work?\n\nLife insurance works by providing a death benefit if the insured dies during\nthe policy period. Permanent life policies offer lifetime coverage; term\npolicies cover only a certain timeframe. In all cases, the value of the death\nbenefit is designed to exceed the cost of the policy.\n\nHow much is life insurance?\n\nLife insurance policies vary significantly in price \u2013 from a few hundred to\nthousands of dollars \u2013 depending on a number of factors. The type of insurance\npurchased, amount of the death benefit, age and health of the insured, and\noptions or riders all factor into cost.\n\nDo I need life insurance?\n\nLife insurance is purchased to pay off debts and/or provide financial security\nto loved ones after death. It's often used to cover funeral costs, replace\nincome or pay off a mortgage. If your assets at death will not cover your\nexpenses and you wish to care for others or leave a legacy, a life insurance\npolicy can help.\n\n## Resources for you\n\nThe Learning Center can help you on your path to affordable coverage.\n\nLife insurance basics\n\nWhy get life insurance?\n\nLearn more\n\nPolicy finder\n\nNot sure what you need?
