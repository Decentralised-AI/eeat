In many cases, this includes things like having dependents or partner\nthat depends on your income, or things like debt, including student loans or a\nmortgage. Permanent life insurance is also useful for those who want to be\nable to leave a financial legacy for their children or families.\n\n## How does life insurance work?\n\nLife insurance functions differently depending on what type of coverage you\nchoose.\n\nGenerally, you first receive your life insurance quotes and then you apply for\na policy. After applying, your information is sent through underwriting, a\nprocess that determines your life insurance rates, and the amount of coverage\nyou\u2019re eligible for. This is also where you\u2019ll undergo a medical exam if\nrequired. From there, your application will be approved or denied.\n\nFor term life insurance, you\u2019ll make monthly payments for a set number of\nyears. If you survive to the end of the term, there\u2019s no payout. If you die\nbefore the end of the term, your loved ones receive a payout from the policy.\n\nWith whole or permanent life insurance policies, such as universal life\ninsurance, you\u2019ll pay into the account, and the coverage will follow you for\nyour entire life. With whole life insurance, the premiums and death benefit\nare fixed from the beginning of the policy. With universal life insurance, the\npremium and death benefit can both change throughout the life of the policy.\nAt the end of your life, as long as there\u2019s value in the policy, there will be\na payout to your family and loved ones.\n\nDifferent policy options, called riders, can be added to personalize your\ncoverage. Things like accelerated death benefit riders or long-term care\nprovisions can be added to your policy to make it a better fit for your needs.\n\n## What are the different types of life insurance?\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about several common types of life insurance:\n\n  *  **Term insurance:** This coverage generally has the cheapest premiums and offers coverage for a set number of years. After that term expires, there\u2019s no coverage or death benefit.\n  *  **Whole life insurance:** Whole life insurance policies follow you for your whole life, building a cash value. The family or organizations you choose, also called beneficiaries, will receive money when you die. \n  *  **Indexed universal life insurance:** Like whole life insurance, this policy also lasts a lifetime and builds cash value, earning value based on index funds. \n  *  **Guaranteed universal life insurance:** Like term policies, this type of permanent life insurance generally has a very high age as an end date where the policy will remain active, usually between ages 90 and 100. But, this policy generally doesn\u2019t accumulate much cash value, if any. \n  *  **Variable universal life insurance:** A type of life insurance where you control how the account is invested. This type of life insurance generally doesn\u2019t have a guaranteed death benefit.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which type of life insurance coverage is best for you,\nspeaking with a financial advisor or insurance agent could help you decide.\n\n## How much life insurance should a person have?\n\nThere\u2019s no set amount of life insurance that everyone needs. Rather, **** your\ninsurance needs depend on your income amount, debt, and whether or not others\ndepend on your income. A common rule of thumb is to have enough life insurance\nto cover 10 times your annual expenses.\n\n## How much does life insurance cost?\n\nLife insurance costs vary largely based on your gender, age, health\ninformation and how much coverage you\u2019re buying. While small, guaranteed-issue\npolicies might have lower premiums, a large whole life policy will have much\nhigher premiums.\n\nFor term policies, which generally have the lowest premiums, the typical life\ninsurance premium for a $500,000 term policy is about $26 per month for a\n35-year-old female, and about $30 per month for a male of the same age\naccording to Policygenius data.\n\nFor a whole life policy, premium payments are higher. Policygenius estimates\nthat a 35-year-old male will pay about $571 per month to pay up their premiums\nby age 99.\n\n## What age is best to get life insurance?\n\nLife insurance gets more expensive with age. Therefore, it will cost the least\nto get it while you\u2019re young. Buying life insurance sooner rather than later\ncould help you save in the long run.\n\n## What is final expense insurance?\n\nFinal expense insurance is one coverage option designed to help your family\nand loved ones payout to cover your expenses after you die, like funeral\nexpenses or burial expenses. These policies are generally small whole life\npolicies and may be guaranteed issue, or a no-exam policy.\n\n## Can I use life insurance coverage while I\u2019m still alive?\n\nThere are some life insurance policies that allow for options that could be\nuseful while you\u2019re alive. Some life insurance policies offer insurance riders\nwhich are add-ons to your coverage that could help cover the costs of things\nlike long-term care or coverage to pay for terminal illnesses.\n\nAn accelerated death benefit is one of these provisions. This insurance rider\ncould help while you\u2019re still alive if you\u2019re diagnosed with a chronic or\nterminal illness.\n\nAdditionally, some permanent coverage allows you to borrow against the cash\nvalue component built into the policy.\n\n## I have a life insurance policy through work \u2014 is that enough?\n\nSome employers offer life insurance as a benefit. However, many people who\nhave dependents or loved ones who need their income need more coverage than\nthe typical workplace policy offers. Getting an individual life insurance\npolicy can help add to the amount of insurance coverage you have.\n\n **Subscribe to the Select Newsletter!**\n\nOur best selections in your inbox.
