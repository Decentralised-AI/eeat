In return, the\ninsurance company agrees to pay a certain amount of money to the beneficiary\nwhen the policyholder dies.\n\nDepending on the type of policy, this agreement remains in effect as long as\nthe premiums are paid (for permanent life insurance) or until the term expires\n(for term life insurance).\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * Your life situation and budget should dictate whether you need life insurance, and how much coverage you need.\n  * Life insurance gives financial security to your loved ones in the event of your death.\n  * Rates for life insurance are lowest when you\u2019re younger and healthier.\n  * Depending on the type of policy, life insurance remains in effect as long as the premiums are paid (permanent life) or when the term ends (term life).\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## How Does Life Insurance Work?\n\nDuring their lifetime, policyholders pay premiums to their life insurance\nprovider. Once the policyholder dies, the insurance company pays out the death\nbenefit to the beneficiaries.\n\nTo understand what all this means, it may be helpful to define a few key\nterms. ****\n\n  * **Policyholder:** The policyholder is the person who purchased the life insurance policy and is responsible for paying the premiums. The policyholder is almost always the insured. However, it is possible to take out a policy on another person with whom you have a relationship, such as a spouse, child, parent or business partner. However, doing so requires the consent of the insured.\n  * **Beneficiaries:** The beneficiaries are the people or organizations who will benefit from the life insurance policy. The policyholder can name a single beneficiary or multiple beneficiaries. Most often, the beneficiaries will be individuals, typically family members. However, you may also name a charity, business or trust as the beneficiary.\n  * **Premiums:** The premium is the amount the policyholder must pay to maintain the policy. Premiums may be paid monthly, quarterly or annually, depending on the policy. If the policyholder falls behind on these payments, the policy will lapse, leaving the policyholder uninsured and preventing your beneficiaries from receiving death benefits.\n  * **Death benefit:** The death benefit is the amount that will be paid to the beneficiaries upon the insured\u2019s death. The death benefit may also be referred to as the face value or the coverage amount.\n  * **Cash value:** Some permanent life insurance policies have a cash value in addition to the face value. The cash value functions as a savings or investment account that earns interest. As the cash value grows, the policyholder can borrow against it to take out a loan. Some types of policies allow the policyholder to use the cash value to adjust premiums or death benefits. Typically, the cash value goes to the insurance company after the policyholder\u2019s death and will not be paid to your beneficiaries.\n\n### What Does Life Insurance Cover?\n\nLife insurance provides financial protection to your loved ones in the event\nof your death. All life insurance policies pay a death benefit to\nbeneficiaries of your choosing after you\u2019re gone. Some plans, usually\npermanent life insurance policies, also feature a cash value component you can\ntake advantage of while you\u2019re alive.\n\nOnce a death benefit is provided to your beneficiaries, they can use the\npayout for anything. Typical financial obligations after a loved one\u2019s death\ninclude funeral expenses, medical debt, mortgage payments, tuition and\neveryday living costs.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## Do I Need Life Insurance?\n\nDo you have loved ones who rely on you for financial support? If not, do you\nplan to one day get married or start a family? If so, investing in life\ninsurance may be something to consider.\n\nIf you\u2019re the primary or sole breadwinner of a household, your dependents\ncould be left with debt they can\u2019t pay after you\u2019re gone. A life insurance\npayout can go toward any number of outstanding expenses like mortgage\npayments, credit card debt and even daily lifestyle costs.\n\nIf you own a business with a partner(s) who would be financially impacted by\nyour death, life insurance might be a wise investment to cover expenses or\ndebts in your absence. Even if nobody else relies on you financially, life\ninsurance might be a good idea. For example, if you don\u2019t have the savings to\ncover your debts or death expenses, life insurance can make sure a family\nmember won\u2019t be burdened with those costs.\n\nWe recommend consulting a licensed financial advisor or life insurance agent\nto determine whether you need life insurance.\n\n## Types of Life Insurance\n\nLife insurance comes in two main types: term life insurance and permanent life\ninsurance. Which one you choose depends primarily on your needs and budget. If\nyou want coverage that lasts your entire life, choose a permanent policy. If\nyou need a budget-friendly option, consider a term policy.\n\n### Term Life Insurance\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage for a certain period of time, known as\nthe term. This policy only pays out a benefit if the covered individual dies\nduring the term. As a result, term life insurance tends to be more affordable\nthan permanent life insurance, with a fixed rate that lasts for the entire\nterm.\n\nAs the original term draws to a close, you may have three options for\ncontinued coverage:\n\n  * Let the policy expire and replace it with a new policy\n  * Renew the policy for another term at an adjusted rate\n  * Convert your term life insurance to whole life insurance\n\nNot all term life insurance policies are renewable or convertible. Some\npolicies include a decreasing term, which means the coverage decreases over\ntime. Although the term for most policies will be a predetermined number of\nyears, such as 20 or 30 years, there are some exceptions. Below are a few\nexamples.\n\n  * **Group life insurance** **:** This is the complimentary life insurance typically offered by an employer. You choose your beneficiaries and have coverage as long as you are an employee or group member.\n  * **Supplemental life insurance:** An employer often provides this coverage as an add-on to complimentary group life insurance.\n  * **Mortgage life insurance:** This type of policy, which lasts until a mortgage is paid in full, covers a mortgage\u2019s full or partial balance if the borrower dies before paying it off.\n  * **Credit life insurance:** This type of policy also lasts until a debt is paid in full, with the payout going to the lender instead of the survivors paying the balance.\n\n#### Group Life Insurance\n\nThe complimentary life insurance you receive through your employer is a type\nof group life insurance. Group life insurance might also be provided by your\nchurch or another organization to which you belong. Although the employer or\norganization is the policyholder, covered individuals choose their own\nbeneficiaries. Coverage is typically guaranteed but only lasts as long as you\nbelong to the group or remain employed at the company providing the coverage\nas an employee benefit.\n\n#### Supplemental Life Insurance\n\nSupplemental life insurance is often available as an add-on to group life\ninsurance. Supplemental coverage is usually cheaper and easier to obtain than\nother types of insurance, but, as the name suggests, it is meant to supplement\nrather than replace an individual policy. Most supplemental life insurance\npolicies expire when the associated group life insurance does. That means you\nwill likely lose this coverage when you leave or lose your job, stop paying\ndues or otherwise sever ties with the group policyholder.\n\nAdditionally, supplemental coverage is typically limited and sometimes\nrequires medical underwriting.\n\n#### Mortgage Life Insurance\n\nMortgage life insurance covers a mortgage\u2019s full or partial balance if the\nborrower dies before paying it off. This type of policy lasts until the\nmortgage has been paid in full. Although it is designed to protect the\nborrower\u2019s family from the burden of mortgage payments, the beneficiary is\nactually the mortgage lender. Mortgage life insurance does not require a\nmedical exam.\n\n#### Credit Life Insurance\n\nLike mortgage life insurance, credit life insurance covers a specific debt and\nlasts until the debt has been paid. Typically, the premiums for this insurance\nare rolled into the loan payments. The payout goes to the lender rather than\nany survivors to pay off the remaining balance. Because credit life insurance\nis so targeted, it is easier to qualify for than other options.\n\n### Permanent Life Insurance\n\nAs long as the policyholder pays the premiums, permanent life insurance never\nexpires. Because it covers the insured\u2019s entire life, premiums are higher than\na term life insurance policy. These policies typically have a cash value that\ngrows over time.\n\nRead more about the different types of permanent life insurance below.\n\n#### Whole Life Insurance\n\nWhole life insurance is what most people think of when they consider permanent\nlife insurance. It pays out no matter when the policyholder passes away and\nhas a cash value that increases over time, similar to a savings account.\n\nWhile the policyholder is still alive, he or she can draw on the policy\u2019s cash\nvalue. However, a withdrawal from the cash value functions like a loan and\nmust be repaid with interest. If the policyholder dies before repaying the\nloan, the insurer will deduct the remaining principal and interest from the\ndeath benefit before paying any beneficiaries.\n\n#### Universal Life Insurance\n\nUniversal life insurance, also known as adjustable life insurance, may differ\nfrom whole life insurance in three ways:\n\n  * **Flexible premiums:** The policyholder may be able to adjust their premiums and death benefit as needed, within certain limits. \n  * **No fixed rate:** The interest rate may rise and fall based on market conditions, though the policy does guarantee a minimum rate. \n  * **Decreasing premiums:** The cash value can become high enough to cover the policy premiums, leaving the policyholder with zero out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe terms of universal life policies vary. Before purchasing a universal\npolicy, be sure to understand exactly what it does and does not guarantee and\nhow the costs and benefits might change over time.\n\n#### Variable Life Insurance\n\nLike other types of permanent life insurance, variable life insurance carries\nboth a death benefit and a cash value. The key difference is the\npolicyholder\u2019s ability to invest the policy\u2019s cash value. Depending on the\nperformance of that investment, the cash value may rise or fall over time.\nThroughout all this, the policyholder must maintain a high enough cash value\nto cover any policy fees. Otherwise, the policy will lapse.\n\nIf investments perform poorly, the policyholder may need to pay higher\npremiums to make up the difference and avoid a policy lapse. On the flip side,\nthe earnings from a high-return investment could cover some or all of the\npremium costs. Another benefit is that, unlike with most policies, the cash\nvalue of a variable policy can be added to the death benefit.\n\n#### Final Expense Life Insurance\n\nFinal expense life insurance, also known as burial or funeral insurance, is\nmeant to cover bills that will be charged to the policyholder\u2019s family or\nestate. Examples include medical and funeral costs plus any unpaid debts, such\nas a mortgage or credit card balance. Because the death benefit typically\nfalls between $5,000 and $25,000, this coverage may be less expensive and\neasier to obtain than other permanent life insurance policies.\n\n#### Survivorship Life Insurance\n\nA survivorship life insurance policy covers two people, typically two spouses.\nAs a joint policy, it does not pay out until both covered individuals have\ndied. This type of policy may cost less than two separate policies. It is a\nparticularly attractive option if one party has health issues that make an\nindividual policy unaffordable. However, it is less common than other types of\npermanent life insurance.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## Permanent Life Insurance\n\nAs long as the policyholder pays the premiums, permanent life insurance never\nexpires. Because it covers the insured\u2019s entire life, premiums are higher than\na term life insurance policy. These policies typically have a cash value that\ngrows over time.\n\nRead more about the different types of permanent life insurance below.\n\n  * **Whole life insurance:** The most common form of permanent life insurance, whole life covers you for your entire life.\n  * **Universal life insurance:** Universal life provides coverage for your entire life and offers more flexibility than whole life. Universal life allows you to adjust your monthly premium and death benefit.\n  * **Variable life insurance:** A more flexible (and riskier) form of permanent life insurance, variable life features flexible premiums and a cash value that rises and falls with your selected investments.\n  * **Final expense life insurance:** Also known as burial insurance, final expense life insurance covers end-of-life expenses like funeral costs, medical expenses or debts. These plans provide a smaller benefit and can benefit older or less healthy people who can\u2019t qualify for other coverage.\n  * **Survivorship life insurance:** This is a form of joint life insurance that covers two people on a single policy, paying the death benefit once both insured policyholders pass away.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## How Much Does Life Insurance Cost?\n\nThe cost of life insurance can vary dramatically based on several factors. The\nmost obvious factors are the type of policy you choose, your age and your\nhealth. As noted above, term life insurance policies are generally more\naffordable than permanent ones. However, prices can vary even within those\ncategories. The longer the term and the higher the coverage amount, the more a\npolicy will cost.\n\nFurther, certain factors can cause the same policy to cost significantly more\nfor one person than another. Insurance companies base their rates on how soon\nor likely a payout might be. As a result, anything that might lower your life\nexpectancy or increase your risk of serious illness or death will negatively\nimpact your life insurance rates. ****\n\n  * **Age:** As you age, it becomes less likely that you will pay enough to cover the full death benefit of your policy. This makes you riskier to insure and leads to higher premiums.\n  * **Gender:** According to 2021 data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the life expectancy for males in the U.S. is about 6 years shorter than that of females. As a result, life insurance rates tend to be higher for males than females. One exception might be if you obtain insurance during a high-risk pregnancy.\n  * **Height and weight:** Insurance companies may ask for your height and weight to calculate your body mass index (BMI), a measure of body fat. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a high BMI is associated with an increased risk of several diseases and health conditions, including heart disease and stroke.\n  * **Past and current health:** You can expect insurers to seek information about your current health and medical history. Certain preexisting conditions may lead to higher rates or a denial of coverage. Depending on the company and policy type, you may also have to submit medical records or undergo a medical exam.\n  * **Family medical history:** Insurers may ask about your family\u2019s medical history to determine your risk of certain hereditary diseases. For instance, if one or more of your immediate family members have been diagnosed with cancer or diabetes, you carry a higher risk of developing those conditions.\n  * **Occupation and hobbies:** People who work in dangerous professions or regularly engage in high-risk recreational activities can expect to pay more for life insurance. Examples include active-duty military members, first responders, miners, construction workers, race car drivers, rock climbers and skydivers.\n  * **Substance use:** Smoking and tobacco use can heavily impact your rates because of the associated health risks. Likewise, a history of alcoholism, heavy drinking and other types of substance abuse will result in higher rates. Marijuana use, even for medical reasons, may also be considered a risk factor.\n  * **Other lifestyle factors:** Insurers might also consider your driving record and financial history as they evaluate your risk. A criminal background or frequent international travel may also weigh against you. Although a single incident might not disqualify you, a pattern of risky behavior could.\n\nSome of these factors, such as your age and family medical history, are\noutside your control. However, you can make lifestyle changes to improve your\nhealth and obtain lower life insurance rates.\n\nGenerally, the younger you are when you apply for life insurance, the less\nexpensive it will be. You can also lower your rates by avoiding high-risk\nactivities, proactively managing preexisting conditions and maintaining a\nhealthy lifestyle.\n\n## How To Choose the Right Life Insurance Type\n\nAs you shop for a life insurance policy, your needs and budget will play major\nroles in selecting coverage. Age is the most important factor in getting\naccurate life insurance quotes, along with your health history and lifestyle.\n\nHow much coverage do you need? If you have dependents or a spouse who would be\nimpacted financially in the event of your death, here\u2019s a basic rule of thumb:\nCalculate your annual income by how many years your family would need support,\nthen add any anticipated debts. Subtract total savings and other assets, and\nyou have your total coverage need.\n\nTerm life insurance could be your best option if budget is the biggest\nconcern, or if the rates quoted for permanent life policies are more than you\ncan afford. We recommend working with a licensed life insurance agent who can\nwalk you through plan options, pricing and the fine print of various policies.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nLife insurance helps protect your loved ones from financial loss after your\ndeath. If you choose a permanent policy with a cash value component, you may\neven reap some benefits while you\u2019re alive.\n\nThe key to finding affordable life insurance is to apply early. The younger\nand healthier you are, the better your rates will be. Then, shop around and\ncompare policies to find the best deal.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About Life Insurance\n\n###  Why is life insurance important? __\n\nLife insurance can help provide for your family after you pass away.
