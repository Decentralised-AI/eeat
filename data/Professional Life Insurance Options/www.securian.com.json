In fact, you may not even know\nyou have it, since many employers pay for this coverage on your behalf and do\nnot deduct it from your paycheck.\n\nEmployers also typically provide the opportunity for you to enroll for\nadditional coverage that you pay for through payroll deduction.\n\nHere are some advantages of buying life insurance at work.\n\n#### Guaranteed coverage\n\nMany employers allow you to enroll for coverage when you\u2019re first hired\nwithout answering any questions about your health \u2014 meaning you won\u2019t be\ndeclined for coverage. Some employers also offer guaranteed coverage increases\nwhen you experience a big life change, like getting married or having a baby.\n\n#### Group rates\n\nThe rates you pay for coverage are based on the overall health of a group,\nrather than just you individually. That can make group insurance more\naffordable than going out and buying life insurance on your own, depending on\nyour age and your health.\n\n#### Easy enrollment\n\nYou\u2019re already enrolling for other benefits \u2014 so checking the box for life\ninsurance is easy. And because most employers offer payroll deduction, you\ndon\u2019t have to remember to pay the bill.\n\n### Considerations for buying life insurance through your employer\n\nEmployer-provided life insurance can have a few limitations to consider, as\nwell.\n\n#### It\u2019s usually temporary\n\nMost life insurance coverage through your employer is term life insurance,\nwhich provides coverage for a specific period of time \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s\nyour period of employment.\n\nIf you decide to retire or leave your current employer, your coverage will\nend, although many employers' plans offer options to continue your coverage.\n\n#### Limited customization\n\nYou usually aren\u2019t able to customize the policy features your employer\nselected.\n\n#### Limited coverage amounts\n\nBased on your family\u2019s financial goals and obligations, you may find that you\nneed more life insurance than you can get through your employer.\n\nReview your options to determine if it offers the level of coverage you need\nto protect your family and provide them with the financial support they would\nneed if they lost you.\n\n### Is one year\u2019s salary enough for life insurance?\n\nIn many cases, an employer policy bases your life insurance coverage on a\nmultiple of your salary. Generally, the coverage you\u2019re automatically enrolled\nfor is just one year\u2019s salary.\n\nIf you are young, single and don\u2019t have much debt, one year\u2019s salary may be\nenough to help your family cover your debts and funeral costs.\n\nBut if you\u2019re older \u2014 with a mortgage, a higher salary and family members\ndependent on your income \u2014 one year\u2019s salary may not be enough.\n\nUse our insurance needs calculator to do the math and determine what amount of\ncoverage is right for you.\n\nTo make up the difference, you can typically purchase more coverage through\nyour employer\u2019s plan or you can purchase an individual life insurance policy\non your own.\n\n### Should you buy additional life insurance through your employer?\n\nMost employers\u2019 plans offer the option to elect additional coverage beyond\nwhat they automatically provide.\n\nYou pay the premium for this supplemental coverage, usually through payroll\ndeduction. Typically, your premiums will increase as you get older.\n\nInsurance coverage through your employer is offered at affordable group rates,\nso purchasing extra coverage may be a good deal for you and be more affordable\nthan individual life insurance.\n\n### Purchasing life insurance coverage on your own\n\nJust because your employer offers life insurance doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t also\npurchase coverage on your own. There are a number of reasons this may be wise:\n\n  * The maximum amount of coverage you can get through your employer\u2019s plan may be less than the amount you need.\n  * Life insurance offered through your employer is typically term life insurance, not permanent \u2014 so you may have a gap in coverage if you leave your employer or retire.\n  * Term life insurance does not build cash value like permanent life insurance products. \n  * If your employer offers permanent life insurance that builds cash value, you may be able to take it with you if you leave your company \u2014 however, the premium you pay may increase.\n  * Premiums for supplemental insurance through your employer may increase as you age, so purchasing on your own may enable you to lock in a lower rate while you\u2019re young and healthy.\n\nThere are many ways to purchase additional life insurance coverage. Talk to a\nfinancial professional or your bank or credit union to learn more about your\noptions.\n\n## Like what you\u2019re reading?\n\nGet articles like this delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nSign up\n\n#### Estimate your needs\n\nYou may be surprised to learn how much life insurance you need.  \n\nUse our calculator\n\nLife insurance products contain charges, such as Cost of Insurance Charge,\nCash Extra Charge, and Additional Agreements Charge (which we refer to as\nmortality charges), and Premium Charge, Monthly Policy Charge, Policy Issue\nCharge, Transaction Charge, Index Segment Charge, and Surrender Charge (which\nwe refer to as expense charges). These charges may increase over time, and\nthese policies may contain restrictions, such as surrender periods.\nPolicyholders could lose money in these products.  \n\n###  Related articles\n\n## Supplemental health insurance benefits  (article with video)\n\n## Why do I need life insurance?
