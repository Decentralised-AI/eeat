Life\n\n# Life Insurance\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## **Overview**\n\n##### Life insurance provides a death benefit for an individual's\nbeneficiaries. It allows survivors to pay off debts and other expenses; it can\nalso provide a source of income to replace that lost by the death of the\ninsured.\n\n##### There are two primary types of life insurance: term, which provides\ninsurance for a specified period of time at a lower cost; and permanent, which\nprovides a certain amount of coverage at variable rates.\n\n##### There are other variations, including universal life, which builds cash\nvalue and is widely marketed by life insurance companies.\n\n* * *\n\nSearch for Unclaimed Property Related to Life Insurance Claims\n\n* * *\n\n### **Consumer Resources**\n\n* * *\n\n  * File a Complaint  \n  \n\n  * Public Records Requests  \n  \n\n  * Department of Financial Services' Life Insurance Overview  \n  \n\n  * Department of Financial Services' Life Insurance Guide  \n  \n\n  * Informational Memoranda  \n  \n\n  * Industry Reports\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n### **Life Claim Settlement Practices**\n\nOne of the more important things a person can do during their lifetime is to\npurchase a life insurance policy to cover final death expenses and possibly\neven leave a monetary benefit to their heirs. However, there are times when a\npolicy purchased years earlier goes unnoticed and unclaimed following the\npolicyholder\u2019s death.\n\nThere are two ways the identified property and/or funds are being returned to\nFlorida consumers:\n\n  *  **Directly from the life insurance company** , through improved internal search processes imposed as part of the regulatory settlement agreements.  \n  \n\n  *  **Florida's Department of Financial Services' Bureau of Unclaimed Property** , the insurance company remits property to the state when they are unsuccessful at locating a beneficiary. Families may then search the website for a loved one's name to see if there is unclaimed property available to collect. The website is available here.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Statutes, Rules, & Legislative Changes**\n\nPrimary Statutes\n\nExpand all Collapse all\n\n###  Life Statutes\n\nChapter 627; Part III\n\n  * Life Insurance & Annuity Contracts (Sections 627.451-627.482)\n\nChapter 627; Part IV\n\n  * Industrial Life Insurance Policies (Sections 627.501-627.522)\n\nChapter 627; Part V\n\n  * Group Life Insurance Policies (Sections 627.551-627.575)\n\nChapter 627; Part IX\n\n  * Credit Life & Disability Insurance (Sections 627.676-627.6845)\n\nChapter 627; Part XIV\n\n  *  Variable or Indeterminate Value Contracts (Sections 627.801-627.807)\n\nPrimary Rules\n\nExpand all Collapse all\n\n###  Life Rules\n\n69O-149\n\n  * Filing of Forms and Rates for Life/Health Insurance\n\n69O-150\n\n  * Life and Health Advertising Requirements\n\n69O-151\n\n  * Requirements for Replacement of Life and Health Coverage\n\n69O-163\n\n  * Credit Life and Credit Disability Insurance\n\nLegislative Changes\n\nExpand all Collapse all\n\n###  Life Legislative Changes\n\n2022\n\n  * HB 1099: Living Organ Donors in Insurance Policies ****\n\n2021\n\n  * HB 797: Florida Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association\n\n2020\n\n  * HB 1189: Genetic Information for Insurance Purposes\n\n2019\n\n  * HB 673: Insurer Guaranty Associations\n\n2017\n\n  * HB 307: Florida Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association\n\n2016\n\n  * SB 966: Unclaimed Property\n\n2013\n\n  * HB 383: Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact\n\n2010\n\n  * SB 885: Relating to Life Insurance\n  * SB 926: Relating to Trusts\n\n2008\n\n  * SB 648: Insurable Interest Contracts\n  * SB 2082: Insurance/Annuities\n\n2006\n\n  * HB 299: Travel Limited Life Insurance\n\n2005\n\n  * HB 105: Life Insurance & Annuity Contracts\n\n* * *\n\n### **Data Resources**\n\nNAIC Complaint & Financial Information by Company\n\nRate & Form Filing Search\n\nOIR Active Company Search\n\n* * *\n\n#### OFFICE OF INSURANCE REGULATION\n\n200 East Gaines Street  \nTallahassee, Florida 32399  \n(850) 413-3140  \n\nCopyright \u00a9 Florida Office of Insurance Regulation 2021\n\n",
