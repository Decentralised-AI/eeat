With a\nlife insurance policy from Nationwide, you can help secure your family\u2019s\nfinancial future by paying for college, paying off a mortgage, covering any\nfinal expenses or estate taxes, and more.\n\n## Types of life insurance\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent\nlife insurance. Term life insurance simply covers you for a specified amount\nof time (10-, 20- and 30-year policies being the most common). Permanent life\ninsurance can be broken down into three types: universal, whole and variable.\nYou can use this tool to get a better understanding of which type of life\ninsurance is right for you.\n\n  * lock icon\n\n##### Term\n\nTerm life insurance can be used to replace lost income. This can provide a\nsafety net for your family and help them meet their financial goals.\n\n  * shield icon\n\n##### Universal\n\nUniversal life insurance offers flexible payment options, death benefits and\ncash value.\n\n  * life insurance icon\n\n##### Whole\n\nWhole life insurance can be used to help cover the cost of final expenses and\nleave something for beneficiaries.\n\n  * marketing icon\n\n##### Variable\n\nVariable life insurance offers whole life protection and an investing\ncomponent similar to a mutual fund.\n\n  * heart icon\n\n##### Long-term care\n\nLong-term care (LTC) coverage can be used to pay for potential LTC expenses\nand offers a death benefit.\n\n## Common life insurance questions\n\n### Who needs life insurance?\n\nGenerally speaking, if you have dependents or are married, your family can\nbenefit from you having a life insurance policy. Life insurance offers peace\nof mind by ensuring that your loved ones will be taken care of in the event of\nyour untimely death. Plus, payouts are tax-free.\n\n### Why should I get coverage now?\n\nRates tend to go up as you age. Buying a policy when you\u2019re younger lets you\nlock in a lower rate.\n\n### How much life insurance do I need?\n\nThis depends on what you want to leave when you\u2019re gone. There are two common\nmethods for calculating the amount of life insurance you need: lump sum and\nincome replacement. You can use this estimator tool to get an understanding of\nhow much life insurance you may need.\n\n### How much does life insurance cost?\n\nThe cost of your life insurance policy is dependent on a variety of different\nfactors, ranging from your age, gender, location, and health. You can use this\nterm life insurance tool to get an idea of what life insurance may cost you.\n\n### What is term life insurance?\n\n\u201cTerm\u201d refers the length of coverage that you choose. If you pass away during\nthe term (usually 10, 20 or 30 years), your beneficiaries receive a cash\npayout.\n\n### Why is term life a good option?\n\nWith term life insurance, you\u2019re only paying for the years where the need is\ngreatest (when your kids are younger or in college), and it is usually the\nmost affordable type of insurance.\n\n### Is my policy through work enough?\n\nLife insurance through your employer is not portable, so it won\u2019t come with\nyou if you leave the job. Also, the amount is often not enough to meet\npeople\u2019s protection needs.\n\n### What is permanent life insurance?\n\nPermanent life insurance falls under three types of policies: whole,\nuniversal, or variable. These policies cover your entire life and usually\nbuild cash value over time, but tend to be more expensive than term life\ninsurance.\n\n## Long-term care resources and solutions\n\n### Long-term care basics\n\nBecome familiar with the basics of long-term care coverage by visiting our\ninteractive website.\n\n### Life insurance with a long-term care rider\n\nOur Long-Term Care Rider is designed for people who have a primary need for\nlife insurance but also have concerns for covering long-term care costs.\n\n### Nationwide CareMatters\u00ae products\n\nThese products offer long-term care coverage linked to a universal life\ninsurance policy.

For example, if you get married, have a child or get a promotion, you\nmay want to increase your coverage. Make sure that these strategies and\nproducts are appropriate for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make\nsure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn\u2019t lapse if\nthe market declines. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole\nsurrender your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may\nface tax consequences.\n\nThere are fees and charges for variable life insurance coverage, including a\ncost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person, such as\ngender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and\nexpenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit\nyour individual needs.
