Purchasing a life insurance policy is a way to\nprotect your loved ones, providing them with the financial support they may\nneed after you die. For example, you may purchase life insurance to help your\nspouse cover mortgage payments or everyday bills or fund your children's\ncollege education.\n\nWhen purchasing life insurance, it's important to understand how it works and\nhow your beneficiaries can receive the proceeds of your policy. This can help\nwith choosing a payout option that works best for your estate planning goals.\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * Life insurance is a contract between a policyholder and an insurance company that's designed to pay out a death benefit when the insured person passes away.\n  * There are many kinds of life insurance from term to permanent. \n  * A life insurance company should be contacted as soon as possible following the death of the insured to begin the claims and payout process.\n  * It's important to always name life insurance beneficiaries, whether they are individuals or organizations.\n  * There are different ways a beneficiary may receive a life insurance payout, including lump-sum payments, installment payments, annuities, and retained asset accounts.\n\n##  Life Insurance Basics\n\nLife insurance is a type of insurance contract. When you purchase a life\ninsurance policy, you agree to pay premiums to keep your coverage intact. If\nyou pass away, the life insurance company can pay out a death benefit to the\nperson or persons you named as beneficiaries of the policy.\n\nSome life insurance policies can offer both death and living benefits. A\nliving benefit rider allows you to tap into your policy's death benefit while\nyou're still alive. This type of rider can be beneficial in situations where\nyou're terminally ill and need funds to pay for medical care.\n\n\"Some life insurance companies have designed policies that allow their\npolicyholders to draw against the face value of the policy in the event of a\nterminal, chronic or critical illness,\" said Ted Bernstein, owner of Life\nCycle Financial Planners LLC. \"These policies enable the policyholder to be\nthe beneficiary of their own life insurance policy.\"\n\nWhen purchasing life insurance, it's important to consider:\n\n  * How much coverage do you need\n  * Whether a term life or permanent life policy makes more sense\n  * What you'll pay for premiums\n  * Which riders, if any, you'd like to include\n  * The differences between life insurance quotes for each potential policy\n\nIn terms of coverage amounts, a life insurance calculator can be helpful in\nchoosing a death benefit. Term life insurance covers you for a set term while\na permanent life insurance policy covers you for life as long as premiums are\npaid. Between the two, term life tends to be cheaper, but permanent life\ninsurance can offer benefits such as cash value accumulation.\n\nLife insurance premium costs can depend on the type of policy, the amount of\nthe death benefit, the riders you include, and your overall health. It's not\nuncommon to have to complete a paramedical exam as part of the underwriting\nprocess.\n\n###  Tip\n\nHybrid life insurance policies allow you to combine life insurance coverage\nwith long-term care insurance.\n\n##  What Does Life Insurance Cover?\n\nDepending on the life insurance you purchase, the death benefit can cover many\nexpenses. After a partner or spouse, or parent dies, so does their annual\nincome, so a life insurance policy can help fill in the gaps to pay financial\nobligations such as rent or mortgage costs, funeral and burial expenses,\nschool tuition, personal debt such as student loans or credit cards, and even,\nsupplement the lost income, to help pay for day-to-day expenses.\n\nOf course, many individuals who purchase life insurance safeguard their\nbeneficiaries against financial hardship.\n\nIt is possible to purchase an insurance policy to leave an inheritance to your\ngrown children or grandchildren, an extended family member, or a nonprofit.\nSome policies, like whole or universal life insurance, allow you to access\nyour life insurance funds while you are alive. You may be able to borrow\nagainst your policy as long as you continue to pay premiums to pay for a home\nor college for your children. While you run the risk of lowering the death\nbenefit, if you cannot afford to pay back the loan, these life insurance\npolicies can be helpful.\n\nThe policy itself usually covers natural and accidental causes of death and\nhomicide. In some cases, it covers suicide, although it is wise to research\nthe policy you want to purchase. There may be conditions attached that must be\nmet before beneficiaries receive their death benefits in some instances.\n\n##  Term Life Insurance vs. Permanent Life Insurance\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage for a set amount of time, often in 15-\n20- or 30-year policies, although timelines may vary, depending on the\ninsurer. Term life's death benefit is not paid out after the term of the life\ninsurance policy ends, even if all premiums on it have been made. However,\npremiums on term life policies are usually affordable compared to permanent\nlife insurance.\n\nTerm life can be useful if you want coverage during prime working years or\nwhile your child or children are young to provide some financial protection to\nyour partner, spouse, or children. Term life insurance does not contain a cash\nvalue, and you cannot borrow money against your death benefit. Some term life\ninsurance policies can be converted into whole or universal life policies or\nextended, but the premiums will be much higher than the original cost.\n\nThere are two types of permanent life insurance, whole and universal. All\npermanent life insurance combines a death benefit with a cash value account.\nPermanent life insurance allows the insured to borrow against your life\ninsurance policy. If you don't pay it back, your beneficiaries will receive a\nsmaller payout. Some policies pay dividends on earnings, which can be used to\npay much higher premiums than term life insurance.\n\nBoth whole and universal life insurance cover you until you die unless you\nstop paying the premiums, but your death benefit shrinks as you borrow from\nit.\n\n##  How Much Does Life Insurance Cost?\n\nThe cost of life insurance depends on a few factors, among them, the type of\ninsurance you purchase, the insurance company selling the policy, and your\noverall individual health, wellness, and family history, in some cases. For\nexample, if you go with a 20-year term life policy, and you are a healthy\nadult, you could pay as little as $30 dollars a month for a half-million-\ndollar death benefit. Term life is less expensive than whole or universal life\ninsurance, and all insurance gets more expensive as you grow older.\n\nWhole or universal life insurance is considerably more expensive and could\ncost upwards of $125 to over $200 a month, depending on your age, health\nprofile, and the amount of death benefit.1  \n\n##  Choosing a Life Insurance Beneficiary\n\nAs part of the process when buying life insurance, you'll need to designate\none or more beneficiaries. This is who you want to receive the death benefit\nfrom your policy when you pass away. A life insurance beneficiary can be:\n\n  * A spouse\n  * Parent\n  * Sibling\n  * Adult child\n  * Business partner\n  * Charitable organization\n  * A trust\n\nYou can choose to name a single beneficiary or a primary beneficiary and one\nor more contingent beneficiaries. A contingent beneficiary would receive death\nbenefits from your life insurance policy if the primary beneficiary passes\naway.\n\n###\n\nMinor children can't be named as beneficiaries of a life insurance policy.\n\n##  Filing a Claim\n\nDeath benefits are not paid out automatically from a life insurance policy.\nThe beneficiary must first file a claim with the life insurance company.\nDepending on the insurance company's policies, this may be done online or it\nmay require a paper claims filing. No matter how you end up filing, the\ncompany normally requires paperwork and supporting evidence to process the\nclaim and payout.\n\nYour beneficiaries may be required to provide a copy of the policy, along with\nthe claims form. They must also submit a certified copy of the death\ncertificate, either through the county or municipality or through the hospital\nor nursing home in which the insured died.\n\nPolicies owned by revocable or irrevocable trusts must ensure that the\ninsurance company has a copy of the trust document identifying the owner and\nthe beneficiary, added Bernstein.\n\n###\n\nThere's no set deadline for how long you have to file a life insurance claim\nbut the sooner you do so, the better.\n\n##  When Benefits Are Paid\n\nLife insurance benefits are typically paid when the insured party dies.\nBeneficiaries file a death claim with the insurance company by submitting a\ncertified copy of the death certificate. Many states allow insurers 30 days to\nreview the claim, after which they can pay it out, deny it, or ask for\nadditional information. If a company denies your claim, it generally provides\na reason why.\n\nMost insurance companies pay within 30 to 60 days of the date of the claim,\naccording to Chris Huntley, founder of Huntley Wealth & Insurance Services.\n\n\u201cThere is no set time frame,\" he adds. \"But insurance companies are motivated\nto pay as soon as possible after receiving bona fide proof of death, to avoid\nsteep interest charges for delaying payment of claims.\"\n\n##  Payout Delays\n\nThere are several possible situations that may result in a delay in payment.\nBeneficiaries may face delays of six to 12 months if the insured dies within\nthe first two years of the issuance of the policy. The reason: the one- to\ntwo-year contestability clause.\n\n\"Most policies contain this clause, which allows the carrier to investigate\nthe original application to ensure fraud was not committed. As long as the\ninsurance company cannot prove the insured lied on the application, the\nbenefit will normally be paid,\" said Huntley. Most policies also contain a\nsuicide clause that allows the company to deny benefits if the insured dies by\nsuicide during the first two years of the policy.2\n\n###\n\nIf you or someone you know is suffering from depression or mental health\nissues, get help now. You are not alone. If you or a loved one is\ncontemplating suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at\n1-800-273-8255 or via live chat. It\u2019s available 24 hours a day, seven days a\nweek, and provides free and confidential support.\n\nPayments may also be delayed when homicide is listed on the insured's death\ncertificate. In this case, a claims representative may communicate with the\ndetective assigned to the case to rule out the beneficiary as a suspect. The\npayout is held until any suspicion about the beneficiary's involvement in the\ninsured's death is clear. If there are charges, the insurance company can\nwithhold the payout until charges are dropped or the beneficiary is acquitted\nof the crime.\n\nDelays to payouts may also arise if:\n\n  * The insured party died during the course of illegal activity, such as driving under the influence.\n  * The insured party lied on the policy application.\n  * The insured omitted health issues or risky hobbies or activities like skydiving.\n\n###\n\nInsurance companies can delay payment for six to 12 months if the insured\nparty dies within the first two years of the policy.\n\n##  Payout Options\n\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\n\nYou can also help decide how your death benefit will be paid out after you\ndie. Here are a few of the payout choices available to you and your\nbeneficiaries.\n\n###  Lump-Sum Payments\n\nSince the inception of the industry more than 200 years ago, beneficiaries\nhave traditionally received lump-sum payments of the proceeds. The default\npayout option of most policies remains a lump sum, said Richard Reich,\npresident of Intramark Insurance Services, Inc.\n\n###  Installments and Annuities\n\nModern life insurance policies have seen a monumental improvement in how\npayouts can be delivered to the policy's beneficiaries, said Bernstein. These\ninclude an installment-payout option, or an annuity option, in which the\nproceeds and accumulated interest are paid out regularly over the life of the\nbeneficiary. These choices give the policy owner the opportunity to select a\npre-determined, guaranteed income stream of between five and 40 years.\n\n\"For income-protection life insurance, most life insurance buyers prefer the\ninstallment option to guarantee the proceeds will last for the necessary\nnumber of years,\" added Bernstein.\n\nBeneficiaries should remember that any interest income they receive is subject\nto taxation. You may end up better off with the lump sum rather than\ninstallments, as you'll end up paying more in taxes on the interest if the\ndeath benefit is fairly high.\n\n###\n\nConsider talking to an insurance agent and/or estate planning attorney about\nwhich payout option might work best.\n\n###  Retained Asset Account\n\nSome insurers offer beneficiaries of significant policies a checkbook instead\nof a lump sum or regular installments. The insurance company, acting as a bank\nor financial institution, keeps the payout in an account, allowing you to\nwrite checks against the balance. Such an account would not allow deposits but\npay interest to the beneficiary.\n\nThe term for this is accelerated death benefit. (For related insight, take a\ncloser look at accelerated benefit riders.) Traditionally, life insurance\npolicies will only payout at the policyholder\u2019s death. Talk with your\ninsurance agent about whether this option makes sense for you.\n\n## How Does Term Life Insurance Work?\n\nTerm life insurance is often the most accessible type of insurance to\npurchase. Depending on the type of policy, you may or may not need a medical\nexam, and the policy will last for an agreed-upon number of years, often 20-\nor 30-year terms. You pay monthly premiums on your death benefit, and if you\ndie before the term is up, the insurance company pays your beneficiaries. If\nyou reach your term limit, your policy ends.\n\n## How Does Whole Life Insurance Work?\n\nUnlike term, whole life insurance is a permanent form of insurance, allowing\nfixed death benefit coverage over the policyholder's life. The life insurance\npremiums for whole life insurance are higher than what you pay for a term life\npolicy. Whole life contains a cash-value account, which can accumulate as\ninterest accrues on a fixed rate and a tax-deferred basis.\n\nYou can borrow against your whole life policy, but the benefit acts as the\ncollateral, so your benefit shrinks if you don't pay it back. If you don't pay\nthe premiums or the loan back, your policy will be canceled. Any money you\nborrowed may be considered income and subject to taxation.  \n\n## How Does Universal Life Insurance Work?\n\nUniversal life insurance, like whole life, is another form of permanent life\ninsurance. These policies offer a death benefit and a cash value account.\nUniversal life insurance stays with you until the end if you pay your monthly\npremiums. There are three kinds of universal life insurance\u2060\u2014variable,\nguaranteed, and indexed\u2060\u2014but with all three, you have the flexibility (unlike\nother policies) to change your death benefit or lower your premiums. Your cash\nvalue account's earnings can help pay the premiums on your account.\n\n## Can You Get Life Insurance With a Pre-Exisiting Condition?\n\nIf you have pre-existing conditions, you may find it difficult, but not\nimpossible, to purchase life insurance. Coverage will depend on various\nfactors, primarily your individual health situation. Depending on the life\ninsurance company, some pre-existing conditions like diabetes, high blood\npressure, and anxiety may be covered but with higher premiums.\n\n## How Long do You Have to Pay Into a Life Insurance Policy Before It Pays\nOut?\n\nLife insurance will pay out upon the death of the insured as soon as it is in\nforce. This usually counts as the first premium payment. Some life\napplications, however, come with the option of binding a certain amount of\ncoverage while the underwriting process takes place in case the applicant dies\nbefore the policy is issued (known as a binder). The binder usually requires\npayment up-front when the application is taken and will either be returned or\ncredited toward the first premium once approved.\n\n##  The Bottom Line\n\nLife insurance policies provide both policyholders and their loved ones peace\nof mind that financial difficulties may be avoided in the event of a person\u2019s\ndeath. Understanding how the process works, from buying life insurance to\nfiling a claim to receiving a payout, can help you proceed with your plans to\npurchase coverage confidently.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.\nThese include white papers, government data, original reporting, and\ninterviews with industry experts.
