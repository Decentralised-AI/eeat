Life insurance gives you\nconfidence that your family would be financially prepared without you to\nhandle expenses.\n\nIn the event of your passing, life insurance provides money directly to the\nindividuals you select - your beneficiaries - who can use the money as they\nsee fit, including:  \n\n  * Replacing lost income\n  * Covering basic living expenses\n  * Paying household debts, estate taxes, and funeral expenses\n  * Funding a child\u2019s education\n  * Supplementing retirement savings \n\n###  What kinds of life insurance can I get at work?\n\nLife insurance comes in two main types \u2013 term and permanent \u2013 which may both\nbe available through your workplace.\n\nTerm life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones and provides\ncoverage on your life for a specified period of time \u2013 usually from one to 20\nyears. If you stop paying premiums, the insurance coverage stops. Term\npolicies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy, but\nthey do not build cash value. They may also give you the option to port. That\nis, you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company.specified\nperiod of time\n\nGenerally, you should consider a term life insurance policy to:\n\n  * Get valuable coverage at a cost-effective price\n  * Help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses\n  * Supplement a permanent policy\n\nPermanent life insurance policies do not expire. They are intended to protect\nyour loved ones permanently, as long as you pay your premiums. Some permanent\nlife insurance policies accumulate cash value. That means, the value of the\npolicy will grow each year, tax-deferred, until it matches the face value of\nthe policy. The cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals, and\ncan be used for a variety of purposes. This type of plan is typically portable\nso coverage can continue if employment terminates.\n\nConsider a permanent insurance policy if you want:\n\n  * Protection for life\n  * To put additional money into the policy on a tax-favored basis\n  * Cash value you can use while you are living\n\n###  What are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work?\n\nGetting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family.\nIf your employer offers a group plan, consider signing up for advantages that\nmay include:\n\n  * Competitive group rates\n  * Guaranteed issue, meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam\n  * Convenient payroll deductions\n  * Easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that\u2019s right for you\n\nAll you need to do is sign up through your employer, and sometimes enrollment\nis automatic.\n\n###  How much life insurance do I need?\n\nEveryone is different, but it may be more than you have now. The insurance\ncoverage you may need changes as your life changes \u2014 for example, getting\nmarried, starting a family or buying a home may change the type or amount of\ncoverage you need. Many people are surprised to learn that they may not have\nenough life insurance to cover the many expenses their loved ones could face.\n\nIt\u2019s simple to determine the amount of coverage you may need now. Just go to\nwww.metlife.com/lifeneeds to calculate how much life insurance may be right\nfor you.\n\n###  How much does life insurance cost?\n\nIt may be less expensive than you think. MetLife\u2019s group life insurance plans\nare an economical way for you to provide for your family with competitive\ngroup rates and a wide range of coverage options to choose from. Exact rates\ncan be found in the enrollment materials.\n\n###  NEXT STEPS\n\nContact your employer for more information.\n\nNothing in these materials is intended to be advice for a particular situation\nor individual.
