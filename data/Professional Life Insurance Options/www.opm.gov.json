It is the largest group life insurance\nprogram in the world, covering over 4 million Federal employees and retirees,\nas well as many of their family members.\n\nMost employees are eligible for FEGLI coverage. FEGLI provides group term life\ninsurance. As such, it does not build up any cash value or paid-up value. It\nconsists of Basic life insurance coverage and three options. In most cases, if\nyou are a new Federal employee, you are automatically covered by Basic life\ninsurance and your payroll office deducts premiums from your paycheck unless\nyou waive the coverage. In addition to the Basic, there are three forms of\nOptional insurance you can elect. You must have Basic insurance in order to\nelect any of the options. Unlike Basic, enrollment in Optional insurance is\nnot automatic -- you must take action to elect the options.\n\nThe cost of Basic insurance is shared between you and the Government. You pay\n2/3 of the total cost and the Government pays 1/3. Your age does not affect\nthe cost of Basic insurance. You pay the full cost of Optional insurance, and\nthe cost depends on your age.\n\nThe Office of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (OFEGLI), which is a\nprivate entity that has a contract with the Federal Government, processes and\npays claims under the FEGLI Program.\n\n## FEGLI Calculator\n\nThe FEGLI Calculator allows you to determine the face value of various\ncombinations of FEGLI coverage; calculate premiums for the various\ncombinations of coverage; see how choosing different Options can change the\namount of life insurance and the premium withholdings; and see how the life\ninsurance carried into retirement will change over time.\n\n## Related Information\n\nVideo overview of the FEGLI life insurance program for employees.
