As winter approaches, consider setting up a drive session to improve\nyour winter driving skills. Whether you are a new or experienced driver, it\ncan be challenging to drive on our winter roads.  Not only can I give you some\nbasic tips, we can practice during the winter months.  \n  \n  \nBasic Info: I provide private lessons in the Missoula area.  The new driver\nwill need to be 14 1/2 or older with a valid learner's license.  I will\nprovide the car and pick up and drop off at your location.  Most new drivers\nwill need between 8 and 12 hours with me to become proficient.  I charge $60\n(subject to change) per hour.  \n  \n\u200bKeep in mind that this is not a traditional Driver's Education class.  It\nwill only be behind the wheel practice.  \n  \n **\u200b Please be aware that I will be unavailable for daily contact from\nNovember 23rd through December 1st.  I will be checking my messages every\nthree days as I will be off grid during this time. **  \n  \n\u200bCall or text for availability: 406-552-5950  \n  \nExperience: I have been teaching people (ages 13 to 83 years old) to drive for\nover 24 years and I am certified by the state of Montana.  \n  \n  \n  \nWord search: driving lessons, driver's education, traffic education, private\ndriving lessons, teen driving lessons, adult driving lessons, student driver,\nstudent driving lessons, Missoula Montana, Missoula county, winter driving\ntips, winter driving in Missoula Montana, winter driving school.  \n  \n  \n\n|\n\n  \n  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Tips \n  * Testimony \n\nPowered by  Create your own unique website with customizable templates.
