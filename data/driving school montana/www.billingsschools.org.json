Education\n\n\u200bBillings Public Schools is pleased to offer Drivers Education throughout the\nschool year and during the summer.  Although Traffic Education is not a school\nrequirement, it is a requirement of the Montanan Motor Vehicle Division for\nstudents who wish to obtain their driver's license prior to the age of 16.\nThe BPS Drivers Education program strives to provide teen drivers with a\nfoundation that will instill safety, caution and a basic understanding of the\nlaws that govern driving.    Driving, like any other learned skill takes hours\nand hours of practice.  Drivers Education provides a base of skills and\nknowledge on which students build by practicing with their parents in order to\nbecome proficient drivers.  \n\n\n\u200bThe BPS Drivers Education  program consists of at least 60 hours of\nstructured learning experiences.  At least 6 hours will be behind the wheel\nand 6 hours will be in-car observation of another driver.  The driving hours\nare outside of class time.  \n  \n**Students must be 14 1/2 years old by the first day of the course and must\ncurrently be in grades 9-12.   8th grade students are not eligible to take\nDrivers Ed until the summer session before they start 9th grade.**  \n  \n**_Students are allowed up to 3 absences but those absences must be made up at\na time scheduled by the instructor.   Missing more than 3 days or failure to\nattend the make-up class results in failure of the entire course._**\n\nINFORMATION FOR THE UPCOMING 2023-2024 SCHOOL YEAR SESSIONS IS BELOW.\n\n## Upcoming Sessions\n\n  * FALL 2023\n  * WINTER 2023-2024\n  * SPRING 2024\n\n## FALL 2023\n\n**FALL 2023 SESSION**\n\n**Fall 2023 Session - Sept 11, 2023 - Nov. 7, 2023  All dates subject to\nchange**\n\n**In order to register for the fall 2023 session  s** **tudents must be born\non or before March 11, 2009  and be enrolled in grades 9-12 for the 2023-2024\nschool year.  **\n\n**Registration dates:   8:00am August 16, 2023 through 3:00pm August 23,\n2023.**\n\n**After registration closes. a random drawing will be held to fill the\navailable spots.**\n\n**The fee for Drivers Ed is $320.00**\n\n**Payment deadline - Once a student/parent has been notified that their name\nwas drawn for a class, they will have until Friday Sept. 1, 2023 at 12:00pm to\npay.**\n\n**If payment is not received by 12:00pm Friday Sept. 1, 2023, students will be\ndropped from the class and their spot given to the next name drawn.**\n\n**Classes will meet 3 or 4 days a week (days to be determined)after school\nfrom 3:15pm - 5:15pm.**\n\n**Students will drive with a partner 6 times outside of class time, which\ncould be before school, after school, and on weekends.
