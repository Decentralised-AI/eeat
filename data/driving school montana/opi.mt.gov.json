The Traffic Education Unit approves instructors and school-\nbased programs to ensure Montana standards and requirements are met (10.13.3:\nProgram Standards and Course Requirements for Traffic Education).\n\nTeens who successfully complete a state-approved driver education course in\nMontana have at least:\n\n  * 60 hours of traffic education instruction including 6 hours of behind-the-wheel in-traffic instruction (see Curriculum Standards).\n  * A minimum of 25 days of instruction taught by a state-approved traffic educator.\n  * The opportunity to study for and take the Learner License knowledge exam and receive a Learner License during the traffic education course.\n\nDownload the Montana Traffic Education Standards & Requirements (updated\n2017-2019) for detailed information on Montana's traffic education programs.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n### Looking for a Driver Education Course in Montana?\n\nTeens under the age of 16 who wish to drive must complete a state-approved\ntraffic education course offered by a Montana school district.  Teens under\nthe age of 19 can enroll in a state-approved driver education course if they\nare 14.5 years of age before the course completion date.  Districts may\nprioritize equitable enrollment based on additional criteria such as older\nstudents, first come-first serve, or by lottery.\n\nOnline driver education courses and privately-run driver education schools are\nnot approved by the State of Montana because they do not meet the minimum\nstandards and requirements.\n\n**To learn more about registering a teen driver for  driver education, please\ncontact your local school district or high school.**\n\nVisit Approved High School Driver Education Programs to search for Montana\nschool districts offering driver education. Program dates and traffic\neducation instructors for the current and previous school years are shown.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n### Graduated Driver Licensing\n\nMontana's GDL law (MCA 61.5.132-135) is a three-step program that reduces the\nrisk while new drivers under age 18 develop and improve their driving skills.\nTeens still get to drive\u2014with supervision\u2014and gradually gain experience to\nbegin driving on their own, but with restrictions  on night driving and\npassengers.\n\nYoung drivers face the highest crash risk in darkness and each teen passenger\ndoubles the crash risk.  Safety research is clear that newly licensed drivers\nshould start driving with no young passengers.  Learning to drive is a\ncomplex, ongoing process that requires responsibility and thousands of miles\nof practice to develop competence, skill, and judgment. Just like with sports\nand music, good habits and abilities grow through experience and good\ncoaching.\n\nWhen teens have their full privilege license, parents should continue to drive\nwith their teen, monitor, model, and enforce the rules, and encourage safe\ndriving habits.\n\nMontana GDL Factsheet & Teen Driving Log\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n### Cooperative Driver Licensing Program (CDTP)\n\nThe OPI partners with the Montana Department of Justice, Motor Vehicle\nDivision (MVD) to oversee the Cooperative Driver Testing Program (CDTP), which\nallows certified teachers to administer driver license tests and issue Learner\nLicenses (MCA 61-5-110).  Traffic education funding from a percentage of\ndriver license fees is reimbursed to schools to partially offset school\ndistrict driver education expenses.  Teens must be at least age 14.5 to take\nthe knowledge exam and receive a Learner License.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n### Students with Disabilities in Driver Education\n\nThis guide to Accommodating Students with Disabilities in Driver Education can\nhelp administrators, teachers and parents determine the best situation for a\nteen driver with physical or mental challenges.\n\nThe Informational Guide for Driver Education Instructors who work with Deaf or\nHard-of-Hearing Students is also an excellent resource.\n\n###\n\n##### Driver Education Teachers\n\nMontana's state-approved traffic education instructors are dedicated\nprofessionals who are specially trained to offer high-quality driver education\nand traffic safety training in more than 130 school districts.  Driver\neducation teachers use a curriculum with hands-on classroom activities as well\nas a minimum of six hours behind the wheel.\n\nDriver education instructors are in demand in Montana's cities and towns.\nVisit the OPI Jobs for Teachers page to find a job or post a job opening for\nyour school district. Download the Montana Traffic Education Teacher\nRecruitment Guide to encourage teachers in your school to join the profession.\n\n**Click   _HERE_  for information about the CDTP updates in effect August\n2022. **\n\n\n\n###\n\n##### New Driver Educators\n\nTo teach traffic education in Montana\u2019s public schools, teachers must have an\nactive Montana educator license, an acceptable driving record, and at least 8\nsemester credits in initial traffic education coursework taken at Montana\nState University-Northern (MSUN).  Traffic education courses taken elsewhere\nmay be transferable to Montana. To maintain their approval to teach traffic\neducation, teachers need to be working toward their Traffic Education\nEndorsement and earn the 20-credit minor.\n\n**Traffic education teachers are in demand in Montana.**   One way a school\nfills this gap is to encourage a currently employed teacher to seek the\ntraffic education endorsement.  In just a few weeks from late spring to early\nsummer, an educator can receive enough training to begin teaching traffic\neducation in mid-summer with initial approval from the OPI Traffic Education\nOffice.  Visit the MSUN Traffic Education webpage for details.\n\n**To learn more about becoming a teacher of traffic education and what is\nrequired to maintain your approval, download  Teaching Traffic Education in\nMontana FAQ's. **\n\n###\n\n##### Approval & Endorsement\n\nDriver educators who have received their initial approval need to continue\nearning traffic education credits toward their traffic education endorsement.\nAfter the first eight initial credits, a minimum of 12 additional credits need\nto be earned.  See  **Steps to Traffic Education Approval and Endorsement**\nfor details.\n\n\n\n###\n\n##### Driver Education Instructor Renewals\n\nTE05 Montana Traffic  \nEducation Teacher Renewal Form\n\nCurrent or returning Traffic Education teachers who need to renew their\napproval to teach traffic education in the State of Montana must submit a TE05\nform to the OPI. The form can be filled out above and submitted\nelectronically.\n\nIf you are a teacher  **applying for the FIRST time**  to become a traffic\neducation teacher, please return to the Driver Educators page and follow the\ninstructions for new approvals.\n\nApproval to teach traffic education must be renewed with each renewal of the\nteacher's educator license.  **SUBMIT THE TE05  FORM BEFORE SEPTEMBER 30.**\nYour approval to teach traffic education expires on October 1 the same year\nyour educator license expires.  _Please note: Your educator license needs to\nbe renewed by June 30._\n\nWe require the TE05 form so we can 1) check your driving record, 2) affirm\nyour intention to continue teaching driver education, and 3) update your\ncontact information.\n\n**Submit this form  ** **anytime  following renewal of your educator license.\n** We will approve your TE05 when:\n\n  * Your educator license is renewed.\n  * Your driving record has been checked.*\n  * Any required college credits earned toward your traffic educator minor have been verified by MSU-Northern, Havre.**\n\n_*   If you are registered to drive in a state other than Montana, you will\nneed to obtain a current copy of your driving record from the appropriate\nstate agency and submit with this renewal form._\n\n_** Upon request, MSU-Northern will send OPI an updated Traffic Education\nProgram Sheet._\n\nNot sure how many credits you need to renew?

Training is provided at MSU Northern as part of the initial\ncoursework to become a traffic education teacher.  Upon hiring by a school\ndistrict, the instructor and the district must submit two required forms to\nthe MVD/DOJ to be certified to give CDTP tests to students. Contact the\nTraffic Education office to obtain CDTP certification forms.\n\nCDTP training manuals are available from the Motor Vehicle Division at the\nDepartment of Justice or from the Traffic Education Office and distributed\nonly to CDTP-certified instructors.
