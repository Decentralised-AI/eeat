To alleviate this\nhardship and help young Montanans start learning to drive safely, Attorney\nGeneral Austin Knudsen has instructed MVD to provide a solution to help\nstudent drivers obtain a temporary learner\u2019s permit. Under the new guidance,\nstudents can start the licensing process at 15 years of age through self-study\nand behind-the-wheel practice with a parent or responsible adult. These\nchanges are in accordance with \u00a7 61-5-105(b), MCA.\n\n**Quick Links:**\n\n  * Montana Driver Manual\n  * Parent\u2019s Guide to Teen Driving\n  * Schedule your written test\n\n###       Step 1: Learner\u2019s Permit Period\n\n**Students that are at least 15 years old may apply for a learner\u2019s permit by\nfollowing these easy steps:**\n\n  * Study for the written driver\u2019s test using the Montana Driver\u2019s Manual.\n  * Schedule an appointment at any MVD exam station to take the written exam. When making your appointment, be sure to indicate that you are making an appointment for a regular written exam. Appointments can also be made by calling the Customer Care Center at **1 (406) 444-1772**  during regular business hours.\n\n**At your appointment:**\n\n  * Provide parental consent\n  * Provide the required documents \n    * Proof of identity\n    * Proof of residency\n    * Proof of authorized presence\n  * Pay the required fees\n  * You do not need to show proof of your Social Security Number (SSN); however, you need to know your SSN so it can be verified at the time of your appointment.\n\n**Congratulations, You Passed!**\n\n  * Upon passing the exam, you will receive a temporary learner\u2019s permit which is valid for one year.\n  * To advance from the learners permit to a First-Year Restricted License the teen must: \n    * hold the learner\u2019s permit for at least 6 months and\n    * complete 50 hours (including 10 hours at night) of supervised driving with an adult. \n      * For tips on helping your teen learn to drive download the Parents\u2019 Guide to Teen Driving \n  * The parent or guardian must log the driving hours. To keep track of your teen\u2019s driving hours, you can use the Teen Driving Log. There is also a driving log app RoadReady available from the App Store.\n\n**Conditions During the Permit Period:**\n\n  * A driver with a Learner License must be supervised by a licensed parent or guardian, or a licensed driver age 18 years or older who is authorized by the parent or guardian.\n  * Everyone in the vehicle must wear a seatbelt.\n  * The teen driver must not receive any traffic violations or alcohol/drug offenses in the six-month period before advancing to a First-Year Restricted License.\n\n###       Step 2: First-Year Restricted License\n\n**When teens have satisfied all Step 1 requirements, (including the completion\nof a state-approved traffic education program),they may apply for a First-Year\nRestricted License at a driver license bureau. To apply:**\n\n  * Schedule an appointment for a regular drive test\n  * Bring all required documentation (even if you have provided this documentation previously) \n    * Proof of identity, proof of Montana residency, proof of authorized presence\n    * Driving log; either hard copy or digital version on an electronic device\n    * Drive test vehicle documentation: \n      * proof  of current registration for drive test vehicle\n      * proof of insurance; either physical insurance card or digitally on an electronic device\n    * Valid learner\u2019s permit\n    * A completed Graduated Driver Licensing Parent/Legal Guardian Certification (form 21-1600)\n  * Complete and pass a drive test. After passing, the student will be issued a driver license with a restriction code on the front and back. This restriction remains in effect for one year.\n\n**Conditions of First-Year Restricted License:**\n\n  * Everyone in the vehicle must wear a seatbelt.\n  * Teenage drivers may not drive between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., with some exceptions. \n    * These exceptions including emergencies, farm-related activities, travel to and from school, church or work, and specific parent-authorized purposes.\n    * Law enforcement officials may contact the parent or guardian of a teen driver to verify the purpose for which the teen is authorized to drive between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.\n  * For the first six months, unless supervised by a licensed driver age 18 or older, a teenage driver may have only one unrelated passenger under age 18 in the vehicle.\n  * For the second six months, unless supervised by a licensed driver age 18 or older, a teenage driver may have three unrelated passengers under age 18 in the vehicle.\n\n**Penalties for violating the Step 2 license restrictions are:**\n\n  * First Offense \u2013 between 20 and 60 hours of community service\n  * Second Offense \u2013 suspension of the teen\u2019s driver license for six months\n\n###       Step 3: Full Privilege Driver License\n\nFirst-Year Restricted License restrictions automatically end on the date\nindicated on the back of the driver license, or when the individual turns 18,\nwhichever occurs first. Once the teenager reaches Step 3, the driver license\nconfers full privileges.\n\nHOME  |  CONTACT  |  ATTORNEY GENERAL  |  NEWS  |  MT.GOV |  TITLE 6 INFO |\nPRIVACY & SECURITY POLICY  \n\n\u00a92020 MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n__\n\nX\n\n",
