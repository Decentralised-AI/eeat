Driving-\nSchools.com isn't just a website, it's a platform that helps literally anyone\nfind the perfect driving school that fits their specific needs. We also help\ndriving schools showcase themselves and present their offers in the best\npossible way.\n\n  * How complete is your list of U.S. driving schools? ____\n\nWe're confident that our list of the 10,000+ known driving schools in the\nUnited States is the most complete resource available. Our staff also\ncontinuously works to update the list as schools open, close, or change\nownership.\n\nIf we've missed a school, let us know and we'll add it to the list. If you are\na school owner, then you can register your school for free.\n\n  * How much does a driver license cost? ____\n\nTo drive with a Montana driver license, you\u2019ll need to pay a fee of $5 per\nyear. In addition to the licensing fee, you should be prepared for potential\napplication fees, testing fees, processing fees, or some combination of these\ncosts. Keep in mind that fees are subject to change, and the most effective\nway to stay up to date on current licensing costs is to reach out to your\nlocal DMV. Along with paying the required fees, you will need to bring in\nseveral verified documents, pass a vision screening test, pass a knowledge\ntest, and pass a driving skills test to earn your license.\n\n  * How hard is the drivers test? ____\n\nSome may find it more challenging than others, but with the right amount of\nstudying and practice, any driver should be able to pass the Montana road\ntest! During this test, a driver will be expected to safely operate a vehicle\nin traffic, follow signs and signals, communicate with other drivers, and\nfollow the rules of the road. In addition to generally practicing safe\ndriving, it can be helpful for a driver to spend extra time focusing on the\nspecific skills that they personally find to be the most difficult. Combining\nthat focused practice with general driving practice will ensure a successful\ndriving test.\n\n  * How old to get drivers license? ____\n\nIn the state of Montana, a driver may be a minimum of 16 years old to receive\ntheir full Driver License. A driver must be at least 14\u00bd years old to get a\nLearner License, issued in traffic education, and at least 15 years old to get\na First-Year Restricted License. To work up to full driving privileges, minors\nare required to go through a gradual licensing process with several levels of\ndriving practice. A driver should be aware of any restrictions that are placed\non their type of license, such as the number of passengers allowed in their\nvehicle at one time and whether or not they are allowed to drive during\nnighttime hours.\n\n  * How to prepare for driving test? ____\n\nTo best prepare for a driving test, a new driver in Montana can do three\nthings. First, each applicant should study the Montana Driver Manual, which is\nfull of important laws, essential driving instruction, and valuable safety\ntips. In addition to studying the manual, a driver may choose to complete a\ndriver\u2019s education course. Finally, a driver should practice supervised\ndriving while holding a Learner License. To be sure they\u2019re thoroughly\nprepared for the driving test, a driver should continue to practice supervised\ndriving until they are completely comfortable behind the wheel, even if that\ntakes a longer period of time than expected.\n\n  * How to prepare for permit test? ____\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to prepare for your online practice quizzes, the first thing\nyou should do is check out the Montana Driver Manual. The manual holds all the\ninformation you\u2019ll need to pass the test, including important laws and\nessential driving instruction. After reading through the manual, check out\nsome online practice quizzes! There\u2019s no better way to assess how prepared you\nare than by taking a test just like the one you\u2019ll face at the driver exam\nstation. In addition to studying on your own, it\u2019s a good idea to take a\ndriver\u2019s education course from an approved driving school. Learning from an\ninstructor who knows the ins and outs of state driving laws is a great way to\nhelp cement them in your mind.\n\n  * Do I have to pay a fee to find a driving school? ____\n\nNo!

Expect to communicate through texts or\ndrive over to the office location between 1pm-3pm (and wait outside forever\nfor them to show up) if you plan to get anything done with them. Over\nThanksgiving week, I texted the owner to make appointments for 7 driving\nlessons that I paid for my daughter. I was told to go to their office between\n1pm-3pm on Tuesday. I was not able to make it and asked if I could go on\nWednesday. No response at all, so I texted him over a week later. I texted the\nowner to let him know I need to be able to be able to schedule over the phone\nor else I need a refund because it is inconvenient and unreasonable to have to\ndrive over just to schedule appointments. I thought our interactions via in\nperson or on the phone were good and pleasant until I received a \u201cpolite\u201d ugly\nresponse that shows what an unhinged, twisted liar he is. He claimed that I\nmade rules that he can't follow and that I made threats. Which was completely\nridiculous and untrue outright lies to justify his ugly response. He blocked\nme immediately after his text so that he would not get my response which asked\nhim to clarify exactly what rules and threats I had made.

If you choose this place be prepared to not be 30 seconds to long on\nanything. Brian will at any moment say the test is over and you\u2019ll have to\nreschedule another appointment so they can get another $75.00. It\u2019s a total\nmoney grab. I am sure they are trained to stop the test at any given time so\nthey can make more money. My sons test was stopped by Brian in the paperwork\nportion and the kid didn\u2019t even get to drive.
