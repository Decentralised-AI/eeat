The license program is designed in stages for teens. To get\nthe license with fewer hassles, it is important to keep the following points\nin mind.\n\n**The Montana Instructional Permit/Learner\u2019s Permit**\n\nThe Montana Traffic Education Learner\u2019s License (TELL) is available for teens\nwho are up to 14 years old. However, such a person must be a part of a traffic\neducation program, which must be accredited in Montana. The cost of getting\nthe license is $35.50. You can learn how to drive with your parent or guardian\nif you have this license. When you turn 15, you will become eligible for a\nMontana Learner\u2019s Permit. However, you should have these other requirements to\nqualify for it:\n\n  * A certificate for completing a traffic education program in Montana. This may not be considered if you are up to 16 years old.\n  * Parental consent\n  * Letter of identification\n  * Proof of address in Montana\n  * License fee\n\nFirst make a call to find out when the officials will be around. On the date,\ndon\u2019t forget to take your documents to the Montana Driver Examination Station\nwhere you will be given some tests to determine your soundness. If you pass\nthe test, you will get a learner\u2019s permit that can be used for one year.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the learner\u2019s permit only gives you the privilege to drive\nwith your parent or guardian. You can only practice with a licensed driver\nwhen you are 16. The licensed driver should be at least 21 years old. It is\nmandatory to wear seat belts during any driving class, and you are expected to\nhave a copy of the Learner\u2019s Permit in the car anytime you are learning how to\ndrive. The Learner\u2019s Permit expires in 6 months and after this period, you\nwill be due for the next stage of the program which is the Montana First-Year\nRestricted License.\n\n**The Montana First Year Restricted License and Full License**\n\nGetting a Montana First Year Restricted License is not difficult as long as\nyou comply with the rules. It is expected that you understand the state\u2019s\ngeneral requirements before proceeding to your local Montana Driver\nExamination Station. The general requirements are stated below:\n\n  * Use the Learner\u2019s Permit for a minimum of 6 months without causing any trouble\n  * Drive for at least 50 hours under close supervision\n  * At least 10 hours out of the 50 must be at night\n  * Come with every important document\n  * Documents to bring include Graduated Driver Licensing form. This must be endorsed by your parent or Legal Guardian\n  * License fee\n\nOnce you are sure these things are complete, proceed to your local Montana\nDriver Service Center again to pay the license fee and submit the application\nfor your First Year Restricted License. You will be scheduled for a road test\nafterwards. If you do well in the road test, you will earn the License without\nhassles.\n\n**Penalties for Disobeying the Driver License Restrictions**\n\nIt is important to know the restrictions and avoid disobeying them. These\nrules are highlighted below:\n\n  * Everybody in the vehicle must use the seat belt\n  * It is unlawful to drive between 11PM and 5AM except if there is an emergency or you are driving to church, school, or farm\n  * Don\u2019t forget the law enforcement agents can call your parents at any time\n  * Within the first 6 months, you are not allowed to drive more than one person except if they are at least 21-years-old\n  * From the seventh month, you should carry at most 3 persons except if they are at least 21-years-old\n\nFailure to comply with these rules will lead to the following punishments:\n\n  * 20-60 hours community service the first time you disobey. Your teen license will be withdrawn for six months if you are caught the second time.\n  * If you do well during the one-year restriction, you will get the full license once the restricted one expires. \n\n**Your Financial Responsibilities as a Car Owner in Montana**\n\nEvery driver is expected to have insurance. At least, you should have\nliability insurance that can provide:\n\n  * $25,000 per person for any accident\n  * $50,000 for two people for any accident\n  * $10,000 for damaging property \n\nYou will lose your vehicle license plates for 3 months the first time you are\ncaught without this minimum liability insurance. If you are caught again, the\nplates will be seized for 6 months. You will also be charged $500 and you will\nbe sentenced to jail for 10 days.\n\n**Montana Online Drivers Education**\n\nYou can learn more about these by enrolling for a Montana online drivers ed\ntoday.\n\n**Still not convinced?
