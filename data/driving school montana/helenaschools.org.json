The practice for placement of students into classes is outlined\nbelow.**\n\n  1. Ranked by birth date.  Oldest students have preference for placement.\n  2. Once ordered by birth date, we place students into classes using their class preference until classes are full, with preference given to those students who reside or attend within the HSD geographic area.\n  3. We place students who reside outside of the HSD geographic area in any remaining seats, again using the process of placing oldest applicant first.\n  4. Students who are not placed into a class because of limited available space, will be notified.\n\n### Requirements for Class once a seat is offered\n\n**Mandatory Parent/Student Meeting**  \nThis is required prior to the start of each class.  Bring with you to the\nmandatory meeting:\n\n  * a parent/guardian driver\u2019s license and a black ink pen\n  * student\u2019s birth certificate or passport;  **and**\n  * student\u2019s social security card or Montana ID\n\nTwo forms of Student ID (must be originals or certified copies of documents).\nYou may not start the class without these documents.\n\n**_TO SECURE A SEAT IN CLASS AND BEFORE MANDATORY PARENT/STUDENT MEETING_** :\ne-Payment ($335.00) must be made by credit card, debit card or electronic\ncheck by logging into RevTrak here https://helenaschools.revtrak.net/. Then\nselect Drivers Education; then enter student name, school, and select\n**_Instructor name_** that has been _assigned to you_.  _No refunds_ given\nafter a class begins.\n\n**42 Hours of Classroom Instruction  \n**Classes are offered at Helena High School and Capital High School.  Students\nmay register for class at either school, but a parent needs to provide\ntransportation.  Fall and Winter/Spring classes are after school 2-3 times per\nweek. Summer class times vary during the day.  The individual instructors set\ntheir own schedules for each session, so no two schedules are ever the same.\n\nStudents are allowed two absences (make-up hours & homework are assigned by\nthe instructor).  Since class attendance is mandatory, please take into\nconsideration your family/student schedule (like sports, vacations, jobs).\nThe third absence is an automatic \u201cunsuccessful\u201d for the entire class.\n\n**12 Hours of Driving Observation  \n**Students will drive six times either after school (on days they don\u2019t have\nclass) or on weekends.  Driving time is scheduled by the instructor.  We\nprovide the Driver\u2019s Education car.\n\n**6 Hours of Road Instruction  \n**Driving time is scheduled by the instructor.  We provide the Driver\u2019s\nEducation car.\n\n_Traffic/Driver\u2019s Education classes are not part of the school district\ncurriculum.  \nWe do not offer adult driver\u2019s education._\n\n### For Instructors\n\nTo teach traffic education in Montana\u2019s public schools, teachers must have an\nactive Montana educator\u2019s license, an acceptable driving record, and at least\n8 semester credits in initial traffic education coursework taken at Montana\nState University-Northern.\n\n  * __(406) 324-2123 between 8:30am \u2013 12:30pm\n  * __trafficeducation@helenaschools.org\n\n### Helpful Links\n\n  * Montana Graduated Driver Licensing Law\n  * Montana Department of Justice, Motor Vehicle Division\n  * http://opi.mt.gov/Families-Students/Family-Student-Support/Driver-Education/Driver-Education-Resources\n  * United States Social Security Administration (Social Security Cards)\n  * http://dphhs.mt.gov/vitalrecords.aspx\n\nHelena Public Schools \u00a9 2023\n\n",
