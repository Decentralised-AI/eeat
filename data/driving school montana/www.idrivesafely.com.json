But unless you have a drivers license, you aren\u2019t likely going\nto see them.\n\n#### Montana Drivers Permit Requirements\n\nIn Montana, you can set out on the path to getting your license as soon as you\nreach age 14 \u00bd. You can do this by completing a driver education course.\n\nOnce you have passed the driver education course, you will be granted an\ninstruction permit. This allows you to drive while supervised by an\ninstructor. At this point you are able to get your Traffic Education Learners\nLicense (TELL), which in Montana is basically a learners permit. With this,\nyou are able to drive with a parent, guardian, or certified instructor by your\nside. This is a valuable period, in which the new driver gains a lot of \u201creal-\nworld\u201d experience.\n\n#### Montana Drivers Ed Requirements\n\nIf you have already turned 16, however, you are able to bypass the drivers\neducation course entirely, opting instead to get a learners license from a\ndriver exam station. With this license, you are able to drive when accompanied\nby any licensed driver who has the same kind of license (and for the same kind\nof vehicle). In order to get one of these, you must first pass a vision test\nand a written test, and of course pay a nominal fee.\n\n#### Drivers Ed Online Course Overview\n\nIn a Montana Driver Education course you will learn all about the basics, and\nthen the specifics, of driving. You\u2019ll learn about vehicle safety \u2013 how to use\nyour lights and signals, properly adjusting your mirrors, and so on. You\u2019ll\nalso learn about best practices for driving safely \u2013 school zones, freeways,\nyielding and merging.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of information that a new driver has to remember, but it\u2019s not\nall bad. After all, you\u2019ve been a passenger in a car since you were born, so a\nlot of this stuff is information that you already know (stopping at a cross\nwalk), or is just common sense (slow down in a construction zone). You may\neven know a lot of the rules for dealing with bicyclists and pedestrians, as\nyou\u2019ve most likely been walking and biking for years. And besides \u2013 what you\nlearn from Montana drivers ed is how to be safe, so it\u2019s a good idea to take\nit seriously.\n\n#### About Final Exam and Certificate Processing\n\nAfter the course, the last step is to take the final exam. In Montana, the\nfinal exam is made up of 50 multiple-choice questions, and you need to get 80%\ncorrect (40 out of 50) to pass. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 if you\u2019re nervous, and\nhappen to fail, you\u2019re allowed unlimited retakes until you pass!\n\nOnce you do pass, we will ship you a certificate of completion. This is sent\nregular mail, and takes anywhere from 5-7 business days. If you complete the\ncourse and pass the test before 3:00 p.m. central time, it will get shipped\nthe very same day!\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n##  More Resources\n\n###  Montana Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\n\nCheck out our additional resources above to help find what you are looking\nfor!\n\nLooking for another course?\n\n### Montana Defensive Driving\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever received a traffic ticket, you know how much of a hassle the\ntraffic school process can be.
