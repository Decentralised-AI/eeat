Congratulations!\n\nAs you probably already know, driving is a valuable skill, but can also be\nextremely dangerous.  Therefore, to help new teen drivers develop safe driving\nhabits during their first few years behind the wheel, the State of Bozeman\nMontana has implemented a graduated driver license program for Bozeman Montana\ndrivers who are under the age of 18.\n\nWe\u2019ve summarized a few things you\u2019ll need to know as you begin the process of\nbecoming a licensed driver in Bozeman Montana.\n\n**Bozeman Montana Traffic Education Learners License (T.E.L.L.)**\n\nWhen you are 14 years and 6 months old, you are eligible to apply for a\nBozeman Montana T.E.L.L. so long as you are enrolled in a state-approved\ndrivers education program.  The T.E.L.L. fee is $35.50.  This special license\nallows you to drive so long as you have your parent/guardian (who must be\nlicensed to drive) sitting next to you in the front passenger seat, actively\nsupervising your driving.\n\n**Bozeman Montana Instruction Permit (aka--Learners Permit)**\n\nYou will be eligible to apply for an instruction permit when you turn 15,\nprovided you meet the following requirements:\n\n  * Completed a state-approved drivers education program \n  * Have your parents'/guardians' permission \n\nWhen you are ready to get your instruction permit, head down to the local\ndriver's license office with the following:\n\n* Written parental consent \n* Proof of Identity \n* Proof of Bozeman Montana residency \n* Proof of authorized presence \n* Money for the license fee \n\nFor a complete list of paperwork/documents you are required to bring, please\nvisit the Bozeman Montana Dept. of Transportation (DOT) website.\n\nAfter you receive your instruction permit, you may begin to practice driving\nbut there are some restrictions you will have to follow:\n\n  * If you are 15, you must drive with your parent/guardian (who must be a licensed driver) or a certified driving instructor sitting next to you in the front passenger seat, actively supervising your driving. \n  * After you turn 16, the supervisor may be any licensed driver who is at least 21 years old \n  * All passengers must wear seat belts \n\n**The Bozeman Montana First-Year Restricted License**\n\nTo become eligible for a first-year restricted license, you must meet the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n  * Have held your instruction permit for at least six (6) months and kept a clean driving record during that time \n  * Completed at least 50 hours of supervising driving (10 of which must be at night).  Keep a driving practice log. \n\nWhen you're ready to \"go for it\", head back down to the local driver's license\noffice with your instruction permit along with the same documents you took\nwhen you applied for your instruction permit, including a completed Graduated\nDriver Licensing Parent/Legal Guardian Certification from (a copy is available\non the Bozeman Montana DOT website), plus some money for the license\nprocessing fee.\n\nIn order to receive your first-year restricted license, you will need to pass\na road test.  After you receive your first-year restricted license, a few\nrestrictions will still apply:\n\n  *  For the first 6 months, you may only carry 1 passenger unless you are supervised by a licensed driver who's 21 or older. \n  * For the second 6 months, you may only carry 3 passengers unless you are supervised by a licensed driver who's 21 or older. \n  * All passengers must wear seat belts \n  * You may not drive between the hours of 11pm and 5am unless it's related to school, church, or farm-related activities \n\nPlease adhere to these restrictions!  Failure to do so will result in 20-60\nhours of community service upon the 1st violation and a 6-month license\nsuspension upon your 2nd violation.\n\nOnce the date on the back of your first-year restricted license has passed,\nyou will earn your  full, unrestricted driver's license (provided you have\nkept a clean driving record).\n\n**Bozeman Montana Auto Insurance & Financial Responsibility Laws**\n\n* State law requires that you have at least a certain amount of auto insurance/liability coverage on any vehicle you drive.
