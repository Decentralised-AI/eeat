Technology\u2019s progression is relentless, significantly\nimpacting how we live and conduct business.\n\nThe advent of cloud computing \u2013 delivering computing services over the\ninternet \u2013 has changed data storage, processing and collaboration for small\nbusinesses. In particular, cloud hosting has changed how businesses operate\nand manage their websites. We\u2019ll explore how cloud hosting works and how cloud\nhosting solutions can benefit your business.\n\n## What is cloud hosting?\n\nCloud hosting allows organizations to outsource their website\u2019s computing and\nstorage resources to a third-party provider. In cloud hosting, a network of\nvirtual and physical cloud services supports a business website\u2019s computing\nand data storage needs.\n\nWhile traditional computing uses on-site servers, cloud hosting handles\ncomputer system resources and storage, freeing users from reliance on physical\nequipment. Additionally, cloud hosting doesn\u2019t require active management,\nfreeing a business\u2019s resources to focus on growth and operations.\n\nCloud hosting is a reliable and effective resource that\u2019s accessible, cost-\neffective and scalable.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nCloud and data center solutions are similar but have distinct differences. A\ncloud-hosted system has potentially unlimited capacity, while you\u2019d have to\npurchase and install more equipment to increase a data center\u2019s capacity.\n\n## How does cloud hosting work?\n\nCloud hosting technology splits a physical server into multiple virtual\nmachines. Management software \u2013 called a hypervisor \u2013 is installed on physical\nservers to connect them and create virtual servers, also called cloud servers.\nThese virtual resources can be automated and delivered over the cloud for\nshared use in a single organization or across multiple organizations.\n\nEach server in a cloud setting carries out specific tasks. For example, if a\ncloud service hosts your business website, if one server fails, another server\nwill step in as a backup to ensure its ongoing availability. The cloud host\ndistributes your website\u2019s information through numerous redundancies to ensure\nit\u2019s always available online for both you and your website visitors.\n\nThere are four primary cloud host categories:\n\n  *  **IaaS:** Under the IaaS umbrella, users receive the virtualized hardware resources needed to install their own software environment.\n  *  **PaaS:** On the PaaS side, users are provided with a software environment through which they can install and develop web applications more quickly.\n  *  **Serverless computing:** Serverless computing isn\u2019t fully server-independent. Serverless computing still requires servers to run the code to make it work. What makes it \u201cserverless\u201d is the ability for developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure.\n  *  **SaaS:** SaaS is a software delivery method through which the end user can access and use an application remotely via internet browsers. A vendor houses and maintains the hardware that runs the application.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nBaaS (backend as a service) is another cloud framework that connects mobile\napps to cloud-based services.\n\n## How can you put cloud hosting into action?\n\nCloud hosting typically includes all necessary elements of website management,\nincluding cloud storage and database management tools. Many services are\ndesigned with nontechnical users in mind, offering control panels and\ndashboards with numerous features that make creating and managing a website\nseamless. Through cloud hosting, you can manage your domains, set up FTP\naccounts for remote file transfers, edit databases directly and perform\nvarious other functions.\n\nFor example, say you want to build a business website as an online portfolio\nof your accomplishments. You\u2019ll have many tasks, including the following:\n\n  * Buying a server\n  * Installing the correct software\n  * Learning how to manage your server \n  * Ensuring your website\u2019s ongoing accessibility\n\nCosts could run into the thousands. However, if you opt for cloud hosting,\nyou\u2019ll pay a monthly fee of less than $10 to ensure your website\u2019s ongoing\navailability to the public. You\u2019d just have to upload your website files to\nyour host\u2019s servers, and it will be ready for public use.\n\nTipTip\n\nPay close attention to your website\u2019s landing page. A landing page persuades\nusers to engage with a business by purchasing a product or service,\nregistering for an event, downloading information, or joining an email list.\n\n## How does cloud hosting compare to dedicated servers and VPSs?\n\nCloud hosting, dedicated servers and virtual private servers have distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages:\n\n  *  **Cloud hosting:** Cloud hosting describes a shared-resource approach to website hosting. Your website is stored remotely and utilizes the hosting service\u2019s resources. However, you share a resource pool with many other websites and cloud-hosting users. This can decrease website performance if another site requires more server activity.\n  *  **Dedicated servers:** Dedicated servers dedicate resources specifically for your use. Leasing a dedicated server allocates a specific amount of bandwidth and hardware capacity to your cloud hosting. Everything works the same as with cloud hosting and the tools for managing and maintaining your website. The only difference is that you have your own server that you aren\u2019t sharing with any other users. A dedicated server can be costly and more complex to set up and use. \n  *  **Virtual private servers (VPSs):** If you don\u2019t have the budget or traffic to justify leasing a dedicated server, consider leasing a VPS. A VPS utilizes a mixture of dedicated and shared servers, helping provide resources to customers while keeping pricing on the lower side. Specifically, a single server is partitioned into multiple virtual servers, and you can lease one for a low monthly rate. Each VPS functions like a small server, dedicating specific resources to your hosting without the decreased performance associated with standard cloud hosting.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nVirtualization and cloud computing are often used interchangeably. However,\nvirtualization is the fundamental technology that powers cloud computing,\nwhile cloud computing enables users to access shared resources.\n\n## What are the benefits of cloud hosting?\n\nCloud hosting offers a wide range of benefits, including the following:\n\n  *  **Cloud hosting is reliable.** As opposed to the ever-present possibility of failure with in-house hardware, cloud hosting takes place in an off-site data center comprising hundreds of servers with multiple redundancies. This protects against failures and ensures ongoing availability.\n  *  **Cloud hosting offers physical security.** The data centers where servers are stored typically have multiple security measures in place, including ID card scanners and security cameras. These measures prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing or disrupting servers.\n  *  **Cloud hosting brings scalability and flexibility.** The resources provided in a cloud host setting can easily scale to a business\u2019s needs and aren\u2019t limited to the physical constraints of a single server. If your site experiences moments of extra traffic, the cloud hosting service can easily borrow unused resources from additional servers.\n  *  **Cloud hosting is affordable.** You pay only for the resources you use; you\u2019re not dealing with in-house servers that aren\u2019t being used to their fullest extent.\n\n## Cloud hosting solutions\n\nThere are many cloud hosting providers, each with its own range of features\nand functionalities for both nontechnical and technical users. The best web\nhosting services offer flexibility, accessibility, security, optimal data\nstorage and excellent site speed. Determine your business\u2019s needs and\npriorities, and find a web host to best serve you.\n\nSome established names in the web hosting industry include Just Host, GoDaddy\nand iPage. Each offers competitive monthly prices and a wide range of features\nto increase the value of their service.  \n\nMore web host options to consider include the following:\n\n  *  **Bluehost:** Bluehost provides shared hosting, VPSs, dedicated servers and WordPress hosting with various pricing plans. \n  *  **IONOS:** IONOS is a scalable platform ideal for growing businesses or startups that aren\u2019t sure how much digital space they\u2019ll need.\n  *  **InMotion Hosting:** InMotion Hosting is our pick as the best web host for small businesses. It also offers VPSs, dedicated servers and managed hosting options.\n  *  **A2 Hosting:** A2 Hosting is our pick as the most secure web host. It offers managed WordPress services and other web hosting options.\n\n## Cloud hosting helps every business compete\n\nCloud hosting will continue to be a dynamic industry. Big-name companies like\nGoogle, Microsoft and Amazon have gotten involved in the industry, and various\nsmaller businesses are competing. Thankfully, your small business can avail\nitself of quality web hosting services regardless of size or needs.\n\n _Ryan Goodrich contributed to the reporting and writing in this article.  _\n\nBassam Kaado\n\nContributing Writer at businessnewsdaily.com\n\nBassam Kaado is a New Jersey based writer, communications specialist, and\nartist.
