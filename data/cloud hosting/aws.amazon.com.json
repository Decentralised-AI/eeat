hosting?How does cloud\nhosting work?What are the types of cloud hosting?What is the difference\nbetween web hosting and cloud hosting?How can AWS support your cloud hosting\nrequirements?\n\n## What is cloud hosting?\n\nCloud hosting is when you run your application or website on virtual servers\nin the cloud. Traditionally, organizations hosted applications on physical\nservers purchased in on-premises data centers or hired from hosting providers.\nIn cloud hosting, you pay a cloud provider to host your application across a\nnetwork of physical and virtual servers spanning diverse geographic locations.\nThis method is much more flexible than traditional ones. You access computing\nresources from an existing resource pool and can scale your applications up or\ndown very quickly. And you don\u2019t have to worry about provisioning the right\namount of resources.\n\n## What are the benefits of cloud hosting?\n\nCloud hosting is a flexible method that your organization can use to access\nresources without a huge upfront cost. This method comes with many benefits\nfor companies that work with a cloud partner.\n\n### **Scalability**\n\nThe flexibility of cloud hosting ensures that you always match your resources\nto demand. Your cloud hosting provider can allocate you more or fewer\nresources as you need them. You don\u2019t have to buy new servers and install and\nmaintain them upfront, and instead you only pay for more resources when you\nscale. Similarly, you don\u2019t pay for cloud services that you don\u2019t use when\nyour system is idle.\n\n### **Availability**\n\nMany cloud hosting providers have data centers all over the globe, which\nreduces latency and increases availability. They have additional failover\nmechanisms to protect their services. Cloud hosting companies also invest in\ntechnology like load balancers and content delivery networks to ensure\ncustomers can access highly available services and applications. These\ncompanies make sure that your applications are highly available and accessible\nby users in all geographical regions worldwide.\n\n### **Cost efficiency**\n\nThe biggest cost to local hosting is investing in new hardware and its\nrequired infrastructure. Even after this upfront cost, you still have to pay\nfor ongoing maintenance, which can be costly. Cloud hosting offers pay-as-you-\ngo systems and eliminates the need for maintenance costs.\n\n### **Security**\n\nCloud providers heavily invest in robust security systems and offer high-level\nsecurity for all of their customers. The provider updates and patches their\nsystems, so they\u2019re always up-to-date with the most recent security\nframeworks. Their attention to security also allows them to offer a range of\ndisaster recovery options. Top cloud hosting service providers include\nadditional data backup and recovery mechanisms you can use as an add-on\ncapability.\n\n### **Time to market**\n\nOrganizations that begin to construct their IT infrastructure must wait to set\nup physical hardware, test it, then deploy their new environments. Using cloud\nenvironments, you can integrate new technologies and shorten development\ncycles. When you use cloud hosting, you can significantly speed up your time\nto market.\n\n## How does cloud hosting work?\n\nCloud hosting works because of a technology called _virtualization_ that runs\nmultiple virtual servers on a single physical server. Each virtual machine\n(VM) has a fixed pool of resources\u2014like memory, storage, and CPU\u2014to draw from.\nThey can each run independently to other virtual machines on the same physical\nserver.\n\nAs each virtual machine is isolated, you can deploy different applications and\nservers on them without worrying about interference or compatibility. If one\nVM experiences a spike in traffic, it can pull more resources from the pool to\nstabilize performance.\n\nCloud hosting providers lease out the virtual servers to customers to access\nas required. Depending on their demand, the cloud host allocates multiple\nvirtual machines and resources to them. With this highly flexible system,\norganizations can quickly deploy new VMs, allocate more computing power to an\nexisting one, or adapt IT infrastructure as required.\n\nCloud hosting uses virtualization to create a highly effective and scalable\nyet isolated system. Cloud hosting customers enlist the remote servers to\naccess resources, store and manage data, and use services and applications\nfrom the cloud hosting provider.\n\nRead about virtualization \u00bb\n\n## What are the types of cloud hosting?\n\nThere are four main types of cloud hosting, each of which allocates resources\ndifferently and requires varying amounts of input from your organization.\n\n### **Public cloud**\n\nPublic cloud infrastructure is when a third-party provider manages all\nunderlying hardware, computing resources, maintenance, and availability. You\ndon\u2019t need to buy or own any of your own servers and can scale as demand\nrequires.\n\n### **Private cloud**\n\nA private cloud is a cloud computing environment that you build and maintain\nyourself, which your organization then makes use of. All underlying computing\nresources\u2014like storage, CPU, and memory\u2014are your responsibility. Some\ncompanies call a private cloud an _internal cloud_ or _corporate cloud_.\n\n### **Hybrid cloud**\n\nA hybrid cloud is IT infrastructure that blends both public and private cloud\napproaches. You can run applications across multiple environments or store\ndata in distinct locations without any decrease in performance. Your hybrid\ncloud environment consolidates all of your available infrastructure and aligns\nit with third-party resources.\n\n### **Managed cloud**\n\nA managed cloud is where you work with a third-party public cloud but allow\nthem to manage all operational practices. For example, the third-party\nprovider will manage monitoring, incident detection, security, backups,\npatching, cost optimization, and incident reaction. When you partner with a\nmanaged cloud, you can access their specialized automation, experience, and\nskills. This approach reduces risk while letting you focus on your core\nbusiness functionality.\n\n## What is the difference between web hosting and cloud hosting?\n\nWeb hosting is a general term that refers to a third party that provides\nresources and server space to another business. You could rent this space to\nhost a website, store data, or run an application. Cloud hosting is a specific\ntype of web hosting that uses cloud technology, virtualization, and remote\nservers to provide servers to businesses.\n\nWhile cloud hosting services are a form of web hosting, web hosting doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily involve cloud hosting. Web hosting could use virtual private\nservers (VPS), dedicated hosting, and shared hosting instead of cloud\ntechnologies.  \n\n### **VPS hosting vs. cloud hosting**\n\nVPS hosting is where one physical server is virtualized to then host many\nclients. Each different virtualized environment has access to resources that a\nclient can use. Depending on the provider, VPS hosting may not scale on\ndemand.\n\nOn the other hand, cloud hosting uses a range of different cloud servers at\nonce. As they pool their resources together, you can go over your allocated\namount and draw more from the pool. Another cloud server will provide the\nadditional resources you need. Cloud hosting solutions are much more flexible\nthan VPS. However, VPS cloud hosting is an option as well. In that, you get a\nVPS server in the cloud.\n\nRead about virtual private servers \u00bb\n\nRead about cloud servers \u00bb\n\n### **Dedicated hosting vs. cloud hosting**\n\nA dedicated server is a singular physical device in a data center. You buy a\ndedicated server and become the only one that has access to that server. These\nservers do not use virtualization and rely on real hardware. You access high\nsecurity and high performance because you don\u2019t share resources with other\nusers. However, they come with a high cost compared to cloud hosting.\n\nCloud servers offer a pay-as-you-go billing method that doesn\u2019t require any\ninitial hardware setup processes. You can create an optimal configuration\nwithout actually owning the base server you are working with.\n\n### **Shared hosting vs. cloud hosting**\n\nShared hosting is where many businesses or websites share one server and all\nits resources. As you share these resources, it will be slower than dedicated\nor cloud hosting. However, you pay less for shared hosting, which is much more\naffordable than other types of hosting.\n\nCloud hosting uses virtualization to give partners their own space. Because\nyou don\u2019t need to share resources with others, it\u2019s a more powerful form of\nhosting.\n\n## How can AWS support your cloud hosting requirements?\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) offers cloud hosting solutions for organizations of\nall sizes. With AWS, start-ups, small and midsize businesses (SMBs),\nenterprises, nonprofits, and government organizations can deliver their\nwebsites and web applications in low-cost ways.
