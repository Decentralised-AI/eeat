hosting?\n\nHosting websites and applications used to be a matter of subscribing to a\ndigital platform provider and essentially renting the use of a single server\nor computing cluster. Web hosting services have been around as long as the web\nitself. In the last decade, cloud hosting\u2014where the website or app lives on\nvirtual servers spread throughout the cloud\u2014has become a prominent method of\nbringing digital assets online.\n\nGoogle Cloud offers a variety of solutions for hosting websites and\napplications, including the ability to register and manage a domain, or\nconnect to a global content delivery network to serve content to the users\nwith optimal performance and minimum latency.\n\nReady to get started? New customers get $300 in free credits to spend on\nGoogle Cloud.\n\nGet started for free\n\n## Cloud hosting defined\n\nCloud hosting is the ability to make applications and websites available on\nthe internet using the cloud. Cloud hosting pools computing resources from a\nnetwork of virtual and physical servers, allowing for greater scalability and\nflexibility to quickly make changes. In most cases cloud hosting is also pay-\nas-you-go which means the teams pay for what they use and don\u2019t have to worry\nabout overprovisioning or underprovisioning resources.\n\n## Cloud hosting vs. web hosting\n\n###\n\nTraditional web hosting is typically done on a single server, which contains\nall the website\u2019s files and content. A web browser downloads the documents and\nfiles when the domain is visited by a user.\n\nWeb hosting has four primary types of environments including shared,\ndedicated, managed, or a virtual private server (VPS). A shared web hosting\nservice is one in which a single server is shared among many different domains\nconnected to the internet. This is the most economical of hosting options, as\nthe different websites share the cost of the server. At the same time, shared\nhosting limits scalability of individual websites as they are confined to the\nresources of just one server. This problem is solved with dedicated hosting,\nwhere a domain leases one or more servers that are not shared with any other\nwebsites or applications, though the client is often responsible for managing\nthe server themselves.\n\nA managed hosting service is similar to a dedicated hosting service, but the\nhosting provider takes care of all the server maintenance, including security,\nsoftware and hardware upgrades, and backup services. Managed hosting is\nbeneficial for websites and applications that do not have in-house expertise\nrequired to maintain a server.\n\nCloud hosting and web hosting have several differences. Foremost, in web\nhosting, if a website needs more resources because of increased demand, the\nuser has to change their service plan to allow for more computing power, thus\nmaking scalability an issue. Cloud hosting allows for the content of the site\nto be spread across multiple virtual servers across different regions, and\nwhen demand increases, it is easy to scale. Because of this, cloud hosting is\nalso more robust and reliable than web hosting, while allowing for more\nflexibility to tune the parameters as needed.\n\n## Cloud hosting vs. VPS\n\n###\n\nA VPS is a virtual, isolated environment that is hosted on a single server.\nThe hosting provider places a hypervisor (virtual layer) on top of the\noperating system that divides it into separate components. VPS offers more\ncontrol and customization than shared hosting, though limits resource use to a\ndefined amount on its specific server. VPS is sometimes referred to as the\n\u201cprivate cloud.\u201d\n\nVPS hosting has many similarities with cloud hosting as both allow for\ncustomization and the hosting provider performs much of the work in\nmaintaining and upgrading hardware. As VPS takes place on a limited number of\nmachines, it does not have the inherent scalability, flexibility, or\nreliability of cloud hosting. With a global network and ability to offer\nfeatures like a content delivery network (CDN), cloud hosting also offers\nbetter performance and speed than VPS.\n\n## How does cloud hosting work?\n\n###\n\nCloud hosting works through the process of virtualization. As mentioned above\nwith a virtual private server, a virtual layer is created on the server where\ncontent and other data can be stored. Those virtual layers can then be\nreplicated on other servers on the cloud computing network, spread throughout\nother different regions across the world.\n\n## Advantages of cloud hosting\n\n###  Scalability\n\nBecause cloud hosting does not rely on a single server to store and deliver\ncontent, it can be easily scaled to meet the demands of a website or\napplication by spinning up more servers across the cloud network when usage\nincreases.\n\n###  Flexibility\n\nCloud hosting allows for the freedom to use the appropriate solution that any\nsituation requires by instantly provisioning the parameters of the virtual\nmachines across the network.\n\n###  Cost\n\nCloud hosting often works on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning that costs can\nalso be scaled up or down depending on usage. In contrast, web hosting\ntypically works on a monthly or annual flat fee.\n\n###  Security\n\nCloud providers provide robust physical and virtual security of servers on\ntheir network, protecting website and application data from malicious actors.\nCloud hosting security layers include firewalls, identity management and\naccess control, Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) for transmitting data, and more.\n\n###  Reliability and performance\n\nBecause cloud hosting takes advantage of many servers spread across the cloud\nnetwork, it provides great reliability and uptime. If one server on the\nnetwork fails, another server can fill in and still provide service.\nSimilarly, cloud hosting provides better performance, with servers in\ndifferent regions bringing content to users faster.\n\n## Why use cloud hosting?\n\n###\n\nCloud hosting allows website and applications operators to add or remove\nresources when necessary. That includes more RAM, storage space, or support\nservices such as security or data storage. Cloud hosting provides reliability\nand flexibility at a manageable cost. Cloud hosting also provides robust data\nbackup and disaster recovery compared to shared or dedicated hosting on a\nsingle server.\n\n###  Solve your business challenges with Google Cloud\n\nNew customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud.\n\nContact us\n\nTalk to a Google Cloud sales specialist to discuss your unique challenge in\nmore detail.\n\nContact us\n\n##  Related products and services\n\nBy using Google Cloud, organizations are using the most sustainable cloud in\nthe business, with the most robust artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning solutions.\n\nWordpress on Compute Engine\n\nDeploy Wordpress, a website creation and publishing platform, to Google Cloud\nwith a range of hosting options.\n\nFirebase Hosting\n\nDeploy static content to a global CDN with a single command.\n\nGoogle Domains\n\nChoose from more than 300 domain endings.\n\nCloud Run\n\nDevelop and deploy your favorite language and framework on a fully managed\nserverless platform that scales automatically.\n\nCompute Engine\n\nDeploy a complete web-serving stack from Google Cloud Marketplace or create\nyour own infrastructure manually.\n\n###  Take the next step\n\nStart building on Google Cloud with $300 in free credits and 20+ always free\nproducts.\n\nGet started for free\n\n  * Need help getting started? \n\nContact sales\n\n  * Work with a trusted partner \n\nFind a partner\n\n  * Continue browsing \n\nSee all products\n\n[{ \"type\": \"thumb-down\", \"id\": \"hardToUnderstand\", \"label\":\"Hard to\nunderstand\" },{ \"type\": \"thumb-down\", \"id\":\n\"incorrectInformationOrSampleCode\", \"label\":\"Incorrect information or sample\ncode\" },{ \"type\": \"thumb-down\", \"id\": \"missingTheInformationSamplesINeed\",\n\"label\":\"Missing the information/samples I need\" },{ \"type\": \"thumb-down\",\n\"id\": \"otherDown\", \"label\":\"Other\" }]  [{ \"type\": \"thumb-up\", \"id\":\n\"easyToUnderstand\", \"label\":\"Easy to understand\" },{ \"type\": \"thumb-up\", \"id\":\n\"solvedMyProblem\", \"label\":\"Solved my problem\" },{ \"type\": \"thumb-up\", \"id\":\n\"otherUp\", \"label\":\"Other\" }]\n\n  * ### Why Google\n\n    * Choosing Google Cloud \n    * Trust and security \n    * Open cloud \n    * Multicloud \n    * Global infrastructure \n    * Customers and case studies \n    * Analyst reports \n    * Whitepapers \n    * Blog \n  * ### Products and pricing\n\n    * Google Cloud pricing \n    * Google Workspace pricing \n    * See all products \n  * ### Solutions\n\n    * Infrastructure modernization \n    * Databases \n    * Application modernization \n    * Smart analytics \n    * Artificial Intelligence \n    * Security \n    * Productivity & work transformation \n    * Industry solutions \n    * DevOps solutions \n    * Small business solutions \n    * See all solutions \n  * ### Resources\n\n    * Google Cloud documentation \n    * Google Cloud quickstarts \n    * Google Cloud Marketplace \n    * Learn about cloud computing \n    * Support \n    * Code samples \n    * Cloud Architecture Center \n    * Training \n    * Certifications \n    * Google for Developers \n    * Google Cloud for Startups \n    * System status \n    * Release Notes \n  * ### Engage\n\n    * Contact sales \n    * Find a Partner \n    * Become a Partner \n    * Events \n    * Podcasts \n    * Developer Center \n    * Press Corner \n    * Google Cloud on YouTube \n    * Google Cloud Tech on YouTube \n    * Follow on X \n    * Join User Research \n    * We're hiring.
