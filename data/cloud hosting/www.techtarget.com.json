The provider sometimes allows clients to customize hardware and\napplications and scale servers online. Compute and storage resources are\nspread out across hundreds of virtual machines that load balance input/output\ndemands in a cloud infrastructure configuration.\n\nThe cloud hosting model is a cheaper alternative to the traditional dedicated\nserver model that requires companies to build and manage their own data\ncenters. In the traditional model, servers and storage, with dedicated\nhardware and virtual resources, reside on premises and can be a costly capital\nand operating expense for organizations.\n\n## __Cloud hosting benefits\n\nCloud hosting provides significant capital and operational savings to\norganizations because they don't have to spend a lot on the initial upfront\ncapital cost associated with owning and managing data centers. In addition,\nlong-term data retention becomes a more simplified process, eliminating the\ncostly management of disks and tape systems.\n\nCompanies using a cloud hosting service get data protection benefits such as\nhigh availability and disaster recovery. Many organizations prefer a hybrid\nmodel that mixes compute and storage resources residing on premises with\ncompute and storage in a cloud provider's environment.\n\nOne of the main benefits of using cloud hosting services is flexible and more\ncost-efficient scalability in building applications, websites and other\nservices. Because users can scale as needed, they are charged only for the\nservices they use and do not pay for any unused capacity. This payment system\nmakes cloud hosting a relatively inexpensive method of storage.\n\nBut drawbacks exist. Security issues with the cloud have gained more attention\nas the cloud adoption rate has grown. With data leaving the company data\ncenter, organizations run the risk of intellectual property theft and loss,\ncompliance violations, lack of oversight over rogue employees' actions, and\ndata breaches.\n\nAdditional aspects to consider include high availability, recovery point\nobjective and recovery time objective.\n\n## __Top vendors/providers\n\nCloud hosting services have fueled a rise in the infrastructure-as-a-service\nmodel, in which a third-party provider offers the hardware, software, servers,\nstorage and networking resources to a customer, typically with a pay-per-use\nmethod.\n\nPopular cloud hosting offerings include Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Google\nCloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. AWS is the dominant player in the market,\noffering extensive computing services and more regions and zones than other\ncloud providers. However, Azure and Google have gained traction in recent\nyears.\n\n__Categories of cloud computing services.\n\n__\n\nAmazon offers its Elastic Compute Cloud to handle compute services. S3 is\namong the AWS storage types. Google offers its Google Compute Engine and\nGoogle Cloud Storage for the enterprise. Microsoft Azure includes blob, file\nand queue storage. Its Microsoft 365 is a popular cloud service.\n\nAll three major public cloud providers offer products that support containers,\nincluding Amazon's Elastic Container Service, Google's Kubernetes Engine and\nAzure's own container services.\n\n**Editor's note:** _This article was revised in 2024 by TechTarget editors to\nimprove the reader experience._\n\nThis was last updated in January 2024\n\n####  __Continue Reading About cloud hosting\n\n  * SaaS vs. IaaS vs. PaaS: Differences, Pros, Cons and Examples\n\n####  Related Terms\n\ndedicated cloud\n\n    A dedicated cloud is a single-tenant cloud infrastructure, which essentially acts as an isolated, single-tenant public cloud.
