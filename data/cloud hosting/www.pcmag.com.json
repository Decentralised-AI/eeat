This\ngives DreamHost a unique advantage over many other web hosting competitors,\nwhich generally focus on Linux. Likewise, these plans scale depending on your\nneeds, making DreamHost an excellent hosting option.\n\n### Who It's For\n\nDreamHost should be your first stop if you're running a small to medium-sized\nbusiness venture in need of BSD or Windows server architecture.

The plans are on the pricier side of the hosting\nspectrum, as the servers combine the power and resources of dedicated servers\nwith the immediate flexibility and provisioning of the cloud platform. As a\nresult, plans start at $149 per month (for 15GB of RAM, 452GB of storage, and\n5TB of monthly data) and scale to more than $1,100 per month, depending on\nyour configuration of choice.\n\n### Who It's For\n\nLarge businesses with a dedicated IT staff may not need managed servers, but\nsmall ones may find the option incredibly convenient. With Liquid Web, your\nmanaged servers receive the white-glove treatment to keep your website running\nsmoothly.\n\n### PROS\n\n  * Robust dedicated, VPS, cloud, and reseller packages \n  * Prorated VPS plans \n  * Powerful, high-end server specs \n  * Terrific customer service \n  * Excellent uptime in testing \n\n### CONS\n\n  * Lacks shared hosting plans \n  * Expensive, with few refund options \n\n### SPECS\n\nName | Value  \n---|---  \nLinux Servers - Cloud |  \nWindows Hosting - Cloud |  \nMaximum Storage - Cloud |  917GB  \nUnlimited Monthly Data Transfers - Cloud |  \n24/7 Customer Support |  \n  \nAll Specs\n\nGET IT NOW\n\nToday\u2019s Best Deal\n\nLearn More\n\nLiquid Web Hosting Review\n\n## A2 Web Hosting\n\n### Best for SSD Storage\n\n4.0 Excellent\n\n### Why We Picked It\n\nA2's cloud server plans come in six managed and unmanaged tiers, with each\nincreasing in scale and power. These plans are all limited to Linux operating\nsystems, however. On the upside, A2 offers speedy SSD server storage, which\nlets websites load faster and more efficiently.\n\n### Who It's For\n\nA2 is a good choice if you have moderate hosting needs but prioritize snappy\nsite performance. The SSD storage space doesn't match the size of a\ntraditional, HDD-based server, but small businesses will appreciate the fast\nwebsite loading times.\n\n### PROS\n\n  * Robust hosting packages, particularly WordPress \n  * Excellent customer service \n  * Terrific uptime \n  * Good money-back refund plan \n\n### CONS\n\n  * Lacks Windows server options \n  * Relatively expensive \n\n### SPECS\n\nName | Value  \n---|---  \nLinux Servers - Cloud |  \nWindows Hosting - Cloud |  \nMaximum Storage - Cloud |  50GB  \nUnlimited Monthly Data Transfers - Cloud |  \n24/7 Customer Support |  \n  \nAll Specs\n\nGET IT NOW\n\nToday\u2019s Best Deal\n\nLearn More\n\nA2 Web Hosting Review\n\n## AccuWeb Hosting\n\n### Best for International Server Locations\n\n4.0 Excellent\n\n### Why We Picked It\n\nAccuWeb Hosting has diverse cloud server options, including Linux or Windows\nOS plans and traditional and VPS cloud hosting (the latter offers higher\nperformance and reliability).

Its data centers aren't quite\nas cosmopolitan as AccuWeb's, but they also span the globe. The only real\nlimiting factor is Hostinger's lack of Windows OS servers; you'll only find\nLinux hosting here.\n\n### Who It's For\n\nHostinger's an attractive option for newcomers building their first websites,\nsince the company's plans are a one-stop-shop that includes many useful\nwebsite features. These include free SSL certificates, a free domain, a\ndedicated IP address, unlimited site hosting, and managed WordPress tools.\n\n### PROS\n\n  * High-quality, low-cost plans \n  * Helpful customer service \n  * Terrific uptime in testing \n  * Optional Minecraft servers \n  * Includes the Hostinger Website Builder \n\n### CONS\n\n  * Lacks dedicated web hosting \n  * Not every plan has a Windows option \n  * No phone support \n  * Base shared hosting plan offers just one email account \n\n### SPECS\n\nName | Value  \n---|---  \nLinux Servers - Cloud |  \nWindows Hosting - Cloud |  \nMaximum Storage - Cloud |  300GB  \nUnlimited Monthly Data Transfers - Cloud |  \n24/7 Customer Support |  \n  \nAll Specs\n\nGET IT NOW\n\nToday\u2019s Best Deal\n\nLearn More\n\nHostinger Web Hosting Review\n\n## Cloudways Web Hosting\n\n### Best for Infrastructure-as-a-Service Solutions\n\n4.0 Excellent\n\n### Why We Picked It\n\nCloudways lets you pick one of five managed cloud platforms, including Amazon\nWeb Services and Google Cloud, to act as your website's foundation.

With shared hosting, for\nexample, your website shares resources with other sites that are also hosted\nexclusively on one server. The result is many annoying power limitations and\nthe inability to handle sharp traffic surges. For better service, you can pay\nfor a virtual private server or even a dedicated server of varying power. In\nall these cases, you're relying on one server, and that's it. However, cloud\nhosting kicks that single-server hosting model to the curb. With cloud\nhosting, your website draws resources from multiple servers.\n\nCloud hosting's use of multiple servers gives it advantages over traditional\nhosting. For example, if your website experiences a sudden traffic spike, it\ncan pull resources from another server to prevent slow page loads or, worse,\nthe site going down. In addition, cloud hosting makes it incredibly simple for\nyour website to scale resources up or down as needed. With traditional\nhosting, you may need to move to a different hosting type (say, from shared to\nVPS or dedicated) to obtain the power your website needs.\n\nNote that there are different types of cloud hosting. Traditional web hosts,\nsuch as DreamHost and HostGator, offer cloud hosting packages priced similarly\nto their other web hosting packages (typically in the shared or VPS\ncategories). We're primarily focused on these small business-friendly cloud\nhosting solutions in this roundup.\n\nEnterprise-level, infrastructure-as-a-service cloud hosting from the likes of\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace are also available. Though\nthese are technically cloud hosting services, they are not what's highlighted\nhere. For more on that flavor of expansive (and potentially more expensive!)\ncloud hosting, please visit our story about the best infrastructure-as-a-\nservice solutions.\n\n* * *\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting\n\n## Which Cloud Hosting Service Is Best?\n\nThe chart above focuses on the web hosts that feature the best cloud hosting\nplans of all the services we've reviewed. Note that we are still in the\nprocess of examining cloud hosting offerings as this is a new category\u2014we'll\nbe testing more services in the coming months. Still, with the reviews we've\ndone so far and lots of research, we've discovered what you should look for in\na cloud hosting service.\n\nMany cloud web hosts offer unlimited monthly data transfers, so other factors\nmay help you decide which service is best for your business. That said, if\nyou're interested in \"unlimited\" anything, whether it's data or storage, be\nsure to read the tiny print to ensure there aren't any surprises. In other\nwords, make sure your definition of unlimited matches the hosting service's\ndefinition. They can be two very different things.\n\nSpeaking of storage, we've discovered that cloud hosts typically offer hard\ndrives or solid-state drives that range between 100GB and 200GB in size. That\nsaid, you'll occasionally find a web host that boasts unlimited storage.\n(Again, the usual caveats apply with regards to \"unlimited\" anything.) Solid-\nstate drives are typically faster than their hard-drive-based counterparts,\nbut are typically smaller in terms of storage capacity. If you're looking for\nsheer volume, a traditional hard drive is the way to go.\n\nWhen it comes to server operating systems, Linux is typically the default\noption. Still, some services offer Windows hosting, too. If you have specific\nserver-side applications that require Windows, such as SQL Server or a custom\napplication written in .NET, then you need to make sure your web host has\nWindows hosting. Our Linux vs. Windows Server explainer has everything you\nneed to know about these operating systems.\n\nYou'll also want a web host with responsive 24/7 customer support. Forums,\nknowledge bases, and tutorials are useful tools, but there's nothing like\ngetting another human being on the horn (or at least in a web chat) when\nproblems arise.\n\n### Recommended by Our Editors\n\n10 Easy But Powerful SEO Tips to Boost Traffic to Your Website\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting Before Signing Up for an Account\n\nHow to Get Started With WordPress\n\nSecurity is of utmost importance, too. If your goal is to get into the\ne-commerce game by selling products or services, you need to look into Secure\nSocket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). Those technologies\nencrypt the data that travels between a customer's computer and your company's\nservers to safeguard the information from people with ill intentions.\n\n* * *\n\n## Why Uptime Is Critical for Cloud Hosting\n\nIn each of our reviews, we devote an entire section to uptime because it's so\nimportant. Simply put, if your site is down, clients or customers will be\nunable to find your business or access your products or services. They may\nfind what they're looking for elsewhere and never return. At the very least,\ncustomers will be annoyed, and it won't help their image of your business.\nNeither is a good outcome.\n\nWe added formal uptime monitoring to our review process a few years ago, and\nthe results show that most web hosts do an excellent job of keeping their\nsites up and running. If they don't, they suffer for it in our rankings. Even\nif they get everything else right, sites with uptime problems aren't eligible\nfor top scores. All services suffer ups and downs, sometimes for reasons\nbeyond their control. Those sites that fail to address the problem are\npenalized accordingly.  \n  \n _Mike Williams contributed to this story._\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Compare SpecsThe Best Cloud Hosting Services for 2024\n\nOur Picks\n\n|\n\nHostGator Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nDreamHost Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nHostwinds Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nLiquid Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nA2 Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nAccuWeb Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nIonos Web Hosting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\nHostinger Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nCloudways Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price\n\n|\n\nSiteGround Web Hosting\n\nCheck Price  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nEditors'Rating\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\nEditors' Choice\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\n4.0 Editor Review\n\n|\n\n3.5 Editor Review  \n  \nLinux Servers - Cloud\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n  \nWindows Hosting - Cloud\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n  \nMaximum Storage - Cloud\n\n|  Unlimited  |  100GB  |  50GB  |  917GB  |  50GB  |  25GB  |  500GB  |\n300GB  |  3.8TB  |  120GB  \n  \nUnlimited Monthly Data Transfers - Cloud\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n  \n24/7 Customer Support\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n  \nWhere to Buy\n\n|\n\n$3.75 Per Month With Free Domain Registration\n\nat HostGator\n\n\n\n$2.64 Per Month\n\nat HostGator\n\n\n\n|\n\n$2.49 Per Month for Shared Starter Plan\n\nat DreamHost\n\n\n\n$3.59 Per Month for Shared Unlimited Plan\n\nat DreamHost\n\n\n\n|\n\n4.49 Per Month\n\nat HostWinds\n\n\n\n$3.29/Month\n\nat HostWinds\n\n\n\n|\n\n$8.85 Per Month for Managed Hosting\n\nat Liquid Web\n\n\n\n$8.85 Per Month for VPS Hosting\n\nat Liquid Web\n\n\n\n|\n\n$1.99 Per Month for Wordpress Hosting\n\nat A2 Hosting\n\n\n\n$29.99 Per Month for VPS Hosting\n\nat A2 Hosting\n\n\n\n|\n\n3.36 Per Month\n\nat AccuWeb Hosting\n\n\n\n7.99 Per Month\n\nat AccuWeb Hosting\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n$2.24 Per Month + 3-Months Free With 10% Off Code \"PCMAG10\"\n\nat Hostinger\n\n\n\n|\n\n$10.00 Per Month\n\nat Cloudways\n\n\n\n|\n\n$6.99 Per Month For StartUp\n\nat SiteGround\n\n\n\n$9.99 Per Month for GrowBig\n\nat SiteGround\n\n  \n  \n#### Like What You're Reading?\n\nSign up for **Lab Report** to get the latest reviews and top product advice\ndelivered right to your inbox.\n\nEmail\n\nSign Up\n\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.\nSubscribing to a newsletter indicates your consent to our Terms of Use and\nPrivacy Policy.

Users were quick to grab\nscreenshots of the pricing information, which does not appear to be rolling\nout to everyone. \"If it's available for your account, you should see an option\nto upgrade in the sidebar,\" wrote one user named Zahid Khawaja.\n\nAnother Twitter user who saw the offer on his account, Harish Garg, later said\nit had been removed. \"Seems like someone did a Friday oopsie,\" he speculated.\n\nADVERTISING BY LENOVO\n\nFind Great Deals on Tech.Shop Now at Lenovo.com\n\nKhawaja decided to sign up for the $42 subscription plan. He uploaded a video\nof the paid version, and it shows ChatGPT generating an answer to his\nquestion, \"write me an essay about ways to solve climate change,\u201d much faster\nthan the free version.\n\nThe price may seem high, but it's in line with some AI assistant writing\nprograms. In return, the professional version of ChatGPT can offer customers\nuninterrupted access to the program, even when traffic is high, which can\nprevent free users from logging on.\n\nIn addition, the professional tier promises to offer faster response times\nwhen generating answers to customer queries while offering \u201cpriority access\u201d\nto upcoming features.\n\nChatGPT launched in November as a free service. But earlier this month, the\nSan Francisco-based OpenAI announced it was working on a paid version of\nChatGPT to help rake in revenue. \u201cOur goal is to continue improving and\nmaintaining the service, and monetization is one way we're considering to\nensure its long-term viability,\u201d the lab wrote at the time.  \n\n### Recommended by Our Editors\n\nMicrosoft Makes 'Multibillion Dollar' Investment in ChatGPT Creator OpenAI\n\nArtists Sue AI Art Generators for Copyright Infringement\n\nNvidia Uses AI to Make Our Eyes Always Look at the Camera\n\nThe company has since been surveying interested users on how much they\u2019d pay\nfor a professional-grade ChatGPT. OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a\nrequest for comment. But the $42 amount suggests the lab may have found a\nsizable chunk of enterprise customers willing to pony up that amount.\n\nStill, many individual users in OpenAI's Discord server are complaining that\n$42 per month is too high. \"$42 a year would be more like it,\" one user wrote.\n\nAlong with a paid version, OpenAI is poised to begin monetizing ChatGPT\nthrough an expanded partnership with Microsoft, which plans on pouring\nbillions into the lab. In exchange, Microsoft will commercialize ChatGPT and\nother research breakthroughs from OpenAI.\n\n#### Get Our Best Stories!\n\nSign up for **What's New Now** to get our top stories delivered to your inbox\nevery morning.\n\nEmail\n\nSign Up\n\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.\nSubscribing to a newsletter indicates your consent to our Terms of Use and\nPrivacy Policy.
