The view from our room window was stunning as was the view from\nthe restaurant terrace. Candle light created a warm atmosphere. But the\nhighlight was the quality of the service. A positive culture which was\ncontagious amongst the guests. Thanks to all. We ate at ala Locanda each night\nand were very happy with the diversity and quality of the menu. We hiked to\nRocca Calascio, drove to the observatory and walked, had lunch at the refuge\non Campo Imperatore where we BBQed our meat bought from the refuge.

Shame that it is dominated by three cranes at the moment as they\nare rebuilding the medicean tower, distroyed by the 2009 earthquake (yes, very\nslow activity!) Go to the nearby Rocca Calascia, parking nearby is limited so\nbetter to go before 11am; the walk to the castle is rocky but worthwhile.\nFantastic views of the mountain range around and the valleys around. Book a\nrestaurant for the evening as they get quite busy in Santo Stefano. We ate at\nthe Bettola di Geppetto in the centre of the village and the Locanda del\nPalazzo at the bottom, just outside the village, both very good and with\ncharacter.\n\nShow more\n\nMarina\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n  * 10\n\n### A lovely hill town.\n\nA lovely hill town. Much, much better signage---and---signage placement--- is\nneeded for everything! Even with \"directions\" from 3 different people we\ncouldn't find the trail head for the hiking path from Santo Stefano to the\nRocca Calascio. Also, it was very difficult to find the reception for our\nhotel because of the lack of clear and well-placed signs. Don't let that\ndiscourage you from visiting---just keep it in mind. It is a bit of a\nchallenge. But, Santo Stefano is worth the visit.\n\nShow more\n\nDavid\n\nUnited States of America\n\n  * 8.0\n\n### Our hosts were lovely and were willing to help with anything...\n\nOur hosts were lovely and were willing to help with anything we needed.
