These positions can get lonely \u2014 the higher\nyou rise in corporate executive ranks, the more limited your opportunities for\nmentoring and coaching are. At the same time, demands on your time and\nattention increase.\n\nIt can even be worse for small business owners who often operate in isolation\nwithout expert advice or feedback. So how do entrepreneurs and corporate\nexecutives continue to grow as their roles and businesses expand?\n\nA business coach could be the answer for you. Business coaches are seasoned\nprofessionals who enable startups, entrepreneurs, and corporate leaders with\nadvice and feedback based on their real business needs.\n\nThe best business coaches combine real-world business experience with coaching\nskills like active listening and the ability to ask powerful questions. What\u2019s\nmore, a business coach can be a catalyst for creating and achieving action\nplans. They can also help with KPIs that drive accountability, real results,\nand business success.\n\nUnderstand Yourself Better:\n\nBig 5 Personality Test\n\nLearn how to leverage your natural strengths to determine your next steps and\nmeet your goals faster.

A business coach might help\ntheir client build leadership skills, create business strategies, or improve\ntheir mindset. It all depends on what the person hiring the coach wants out of\nthe relationship. Most importantly, business coaching is about growth.\n\n## What does a business coach do?\n\nWorking with a coach can be similar to taking on a business partner or\nbuilding a trusting relationship. So that you can fully understand what\nworking with a business coach might entail, let\u2019s answer the question: \u201cwhat\nexactly does a business coach do?\u201d\n\n### 1\\. Charts a path for your professional growth\n\nA good business coach helps clients uncover the gap between where they are\ntoday and where they want to be. With the help of their coach, the\nentrepreneur or corporate leader can also create a solid and strategic\nbusiness plan that drives company growth. Sometimes having an outsider's\nperspective is just what a leader needs to unlock new personal and company\npotential.\n\n### 2\\. Helps you discover and clarify your core values and vision\n\nNew leaders often struggle with defining their values and mapping them against\na clear corporate vision. An experienced business coach can help walk a client\nthrough the process of aligning personal and corporate values. From there, the\nclient can develop the strong vision, executive presence, and rock-solid\nconfidence needed to lead their team to success.\n\n### 3\\. Provides customized coaching and expertise\n\nNo one knows the unique characteristics of their business better than an\nexecutive leader. That\u2019s why trying to find actionable material in a book or\nwebsite tailored for the general public makes no sense. Even executive\nworkshops, while valuable, lack the one-on-one approach many leaders need.\n\nBusiness coaches solve that problem in three ways. First, great leadership\ncoaches have high levels of expertise in specific industries and disciplines.\nSecond, they often have real-world experience as an entrepreneur and business\nleader themselves.\n\nThird, coaches can combine these important elements with executive coaching\ncertifications. As a result, they can offer tailored advice and actionable\nplans. All of this customization acts as an accelerant for the business owner\nor corporate leader. It ultimately results in exponential personal and company\ngrowth.\n\n### 4\\. Allows a safe space for vulnerability and growth\n\nThe relationship between a corporate leader and coach is a safe and sacred\nspace. Once trust is built, coaching clients can feel free to share their\ndeepest doubts without fear of ridicule or humiliation.\n\nWith the support of a business coach, the now unfettered corporate leader can\nexplore novel ideas for growth or try on ways to become a better leader.  Not\nonly does this build a leader\u2019s confidence, but it can also directly impact\nrates of growth, corporate culture, and company vision.\n\n### 5\\. Acts as an accountability partner and motivator\n\nA business coach can give corporate executives and business owners a high\nlevel of accountability. With more accountability, clients and teams are more\nlikely to take action on big ideas and the things that scare them. Coaches can\nbe trusted confidantes for facilitating corporate growth and personal\ndevelopment.\n\n## What to expect from business coaching\n\nIf you want to become a more successful business owner or executive, coaching\ncould be the answer. With the right coach, you can expect exponential growth\nboth personally and professionally.\n\nAt the heart of it, the relationship between a business coach and business\nowner/professional is built on trust. If a new business owner has limited\nexperience, a professional coach can actually help speed up growth through\nfeedback. If business leaders need support increasing their executive presence\nwhile boosting revenue, a coach can help put together a plan.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. The best business coaches challenge their clients\nto greatness. In fact, some of the most powerful coach/client relationships\ncan span years. These relationships can deliver long periods of substantial\nbusiness growth.\n\nImagine the power that is unleashed when you partner with a personal business\ncoach who deeply understands your company \u2014 as well as your strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n## What to look for in a business coach\n\nBefore you invest time, money, and energy into a business coaching\nrelationship, you need to do your research. Not all business coaches are\ncreated equal. Here are a few key traits to look for in a successful business\ncoach:\n\n  * Look for success stories from individuals who have worked with this business coach before. Testimonials will tell you the truth about how beneficial this coaching relationship can be. \n  * Consider how many years of experience this coach has. If you\u2019re a 50-year-old CEO, you probably don\u2019t want to be coached by a 30-something who\u2019s only been running a business for a couple of years. \n  * See if they have actual coaching certifications. Anyone can call themselves a coach \u2014 consider if you\u2019re comfortable working with someone who\u2019s never undergone any training. Remember, this is a formal relationship you\u2019re starting in order to see real results from your work. It\u2019s not like asking a coworker to be your mentor. \n  * See if they offer any free business coaching sessions or events. By having a consultation call with the coach or attending an event they\u2019re leading, you can get a feel of if you\u2019d enjoy working with them. \n  * Make sure the coach is aligned with what you need. Maybe you\u2019re interested in a life-coaching approach, or you specifically want a small business coach. Either way, get specific about what type of coaching you want and then look for that. \n\n  \n\n## Business coaches help develop hard and soft skills\n\nSeasoned business coaches have the ability to teach and model the hard and\nsoft skills leaders need to reach their full potential. Here\u2019s a list to give\nyou an idea of the skill set you\u2019ll develop when working with a business\ncoach.\n\n### Soft skills\n\n  * Self-awareness: Leaders can challenge their own beliefs and behaviors when working with a business coach. This Inner Work\u00ae allows leaders to better understand their triggers and motivators.\n  * Emotional regulation: In times of crisis, employees look to leaders for reassurance and direction. That\u2019s why effective executives are masters of emotional regulation. When difficult emotions arise within a coaching session, a business coach teaches emotional regulation techniques. \n  * Confidence: Coachees often report that the coaching process leaves them more relaxed, energized, and confident. In fact, confident feelings naturally emerge when a business coach works with an executive coachee. They learn to clearly understand business goals, action steps, and emotional triggers. \n  * Emotional intelligence: Great leaders can read a room and tailor their message to individual audiences. They possess high levels of empathy and can quickly understand what motivates others. Emotional intelligence is an executive superpower that business coaches cultivate in their coachees. \n  * Optimism: Effective leaders are optimistic. They see the learning and development potential even in the hardest of situations. Optimism can come naturally, but it\u2019s also a skill that can be learned through coaching.\n\n### Hard skills\n\n  * Strategic planning and review: The best coaches are experienced business strategists. As a result, they can help executives and their teams plan and execute brilliant strategies. Together, the coach and coachee can develop a roadmap using a step-by-step strategic planning process. \n  * Analytical skills: Data is a driving force for many successful companies. Business coaching can fill gaps in a client\u2019s data analysis skills while challenging them to get out of their comfort zone.\n  * Marketing: As part of their pre-coaching discovery work, business coaches often spend time researching a client company\u2019s brand and market dynamics. While this serves as valuable intelligence when coaching leaders, it can also support a safe conversational framework for exploring new data-driven market opportunities and target audiences. Before making major product and marketing investments, executive coachees have a second set of expert eyes to review and critique profitability and developing plans.\n  * Speaking and presentation skills: Not all executive leaders are natural presenters or speakers. Some may suffer from stage fright or feelings of inadequacy that thwart their ability to connect with an audience. To solve these challenges, coaches once again create a safe zone to investigate topics like impostor syndrome and persuasive speaking. Experienced business coaches can also review critical presentations and rehearse essential speaking skills with the coachee.\n\n## The benefits of business coaching\n\nWhile hard and soft skill development is essential, it\u2019s the overall results\nof business coaching services that deliver the biggest return on investment\n(ROI). Here are some statistics to show you how big the ROI can be for\ncompanies who invest in business coaching:\n\n  * According to The Institute of Coaching, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, over 70% of coaching recipients experience a marked improvement in relationships, communication, and work performance.\n  * One study found that executive coaching could have as much as a 788% return on investment for the companies surveyed.\n  * A study of Fortune 1000 showed that the average ROI on executive coaching was almost six times what they originally paid for the coaching services.\n  * The Harvard Business Review found that companies who heavily invested in employee development (including coaching services) performed better in the S&P 500 during 2003.\n\n### The coachee becomes the coach \u2014 and helps their company grow\n\nAs a coachee works with their coach, they will learn valuable coaching skills\nfor themselves. They can then apply these skills to coaching their own team.\nAs a result, the impact of just one executive coach can trickle down to the\nentire organization. That\u2019s an incredible way to help a company and its\nemployees realize their full potential.\n\nBut how do corporate leaders and business owners acquire and hone their\ncoaching skills? Business coaches can teach coaching by simply exposing\nleaders to masterful coaching.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, within a coaching session, a leader can role-play and practice\ncoaching with a business coach. This leads to higher and higher levels of\ncoaching competency and confidence. In time, a leader\u2019s ability to coach well\ncan directly impact the bottom line and overall company health.\n\n## Results from business coaching\n\nHere are some other benefits that result from effective business coaching:\n\n  * Revenue growth: Boosting revenue and increasing market share are the main reasons leaders seek out business coaches. Not only can business coaches navigate the complexities of a financial spreadsheet, but they can also work with leaders to explore and remove limiting beliefs. The combination can result in exponential growth and a direct impact on the bottom line.\n  * Resilience: One of the greatest traits of a strong executive or business owner is the ability to bounce back from even the biggest of setbacks. That\u2019s why business coaches teach an array of resilience-building strategies, like positive psychology and challenging negative assumptions. \n  * Leadership: Many business coaches are not only trained coaching experts, they\u2019ve also served on the front as company leaders. Consequently, they are a unique leadership partner who can serve as a mirror to executives expanding their skills. \n\nTeam-building: Building an executive leadership team is more art than science.\nFirst, there\u2019s identifying the holes in an organization that need to be filled\nto drive expansion. Second, and more importantly, there\u2019s pulling together the\nright chemistry of people who will respect, challenge, and complement each\nother. Business coaches can provide counsel on both issues, and even meet with\nprospective executive hires to determine fit and skill.\n\n## Is business coaching a \u201cmust have?\u201d\n\nIt may sound like hyperbole, but business coaching has been shown to mean the\ndifference between success and failure for budding entrepreneurs, business\nowners, and corporate leaders. Even seasoned veterans appreciate the unbiased\nand apolitical input business coaches provide.\n\nIn truth, regardless of experience, no leader comes naturally endowed with the\nability to handle the business demands of a multidisciplinary world. All\nleaders need support to grow to the next level, and one of the best ways to\nget that support is with a business coach.\n\n  \n\nCoaching\n\nPublished June 21, 2022\n\n## Robert Carroll\n\nBetterUp Fellow Coach\n\n## Read Next\n\nResearch & Insights\n\n__15 min read | July 12, 2022\n\n## How companies are using coaching to build connection, community, and\ncommitment\n\nResearch shows connection in the workplace has real impact on the business.\nLearn how some companies are succeeding by building community through\ncoaching.
