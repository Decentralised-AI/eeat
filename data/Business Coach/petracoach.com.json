Our Coaches are vetted Entrepreneurs, Founders and\nCEOs who have been through the exact challenges you are facing today. Our team\nof ACs focus on process development and scalability within your organization.\nAs a team, they lead your organization through the below series of steps.\n\nMember Discovery\n\nBefore our kickoff, we want to dig into your company and understand where you\nare today from a finance, internal structural and culture standpoint. During\nthis process, we will also survey different members of the team, define who\nwill be an active participant (exec team vs entire org), and discuss logistics\nof the planning sessions to come.\n\nMember Kickoff\n\nDuring this two-day kick off, we dedicate a day with the executive team to\ndefine the long-term vision for the company (BHAG), why your company exists\n(Core Purpose), and the values that you operate from (Core Values). At this\nstage and with this team, we will also define the outlook for the next three\nyears as well as 1-year targets and initiatives. Then on Day 2, we will meet\nwith the executive and leadership teams together to focus on the execution of\nthe items discovered in Day 1. This includes breaking the goals set for the\nyear into quarterly targets and priorities. We will further break them down\ninto individual goals, set up the KPIs to monitor progress, and make the step-\nby-step plans to execute.\n\nIn Between Plannings\n\nDuring this time, we have a series of 1:1s and checkins with the Executive and\nLeadership teams to support and help drive progress. During this time, you\nhave unlimited access to your Coach and AC as well as access to the Online\nEducation. Your organization is encouraged to engage in our Petra Perks which\ninclude monthly learning webinars, workshops and events at no additional cost\nas well participate in our Petra Forum Groups. We make so many included\nlearning and growth opportunities available (at no cost) for your team because\nwithout growing them, we cannot scale your organization.\n\nPeriod Planning\n\nEach period / quarter, we spend a full day reviewing the business, the\ninitiatives from that period / quarter and carry over what we need and reset\nfor the upcoming period / quarter. During this time we also mix in personal\ngoal setting and work as we are firm believers that you cannot scale the\nbusiness without scaling the individual.\n\n##  Trusted by Leaders around the World\n\nClick above to hear from Jack Daly - the leading sales speaker and trainer\nwith over 30 years of sales and executive experience.\n\nClick above to hear from Arnie Malham - an award-winning CEO/founder, 8-figure\nentrepreneur and best-selling author.\n\n# A Proven Methodology, Framework and Process\n\n## Everest\n\nThe ultimate coaching engagement for hyper-growth, complex organizations that\nneed access to a broad team of experts to quickly and effectively implement\nthe Rockefeller Habits.\n\nLearn More\n\nmost popular\n\n## Kilimanjaro\n\nOur **most popular** package for organizations that are implementing\nRockefeller Habits and want to scale.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Rainier\n\nAn entry point for small to medium businesses to get started implementing the\nRockefeller Habits.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Matterhorn\n\nA multiple organization workshop-style approach to Quarterly and Annual\nplanning.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Aravali\n\nA one-on-one approach to solving organizational challenges and planning.\n\nLearn More\n\n# Download our Most Popular Action Docs\n\nThese easy to follow worksheets will help align your team on some of the most\ncrucial processes in your business.\n\n  *  \n\n### Company Priority Worksheet\n\nUse this worksheet to build out company priorities, define success and\nidentify the right team and tasks to make it happen.\n\n\u00bb Download Now\n\n### Please Enter Your Email to Download\n\n  *  \n\n### Meeting Rhythm Planner\n\nMeeting Rhythms are the backbone of effective communication.

People turn to them when\nthey need help reaching their goals.\n\nHard work means a lot in business, and it can get business owners pretty close\nto where they want to be. Most often, it\u2019s the final small step toward success\nthat is the hardest. A coach can help you get there.\n\nCompare this logic to your health and fitness goals. Yeah, you\u2019re cutting the\nfats and carbohydrates from your diet and you\u2019re hitting the gym three times a\nweek, but you can\u2019t seem to lose those last five pounds.\n\nA personal trainer will work with you to make sure you maximize your gym time\nand perfect your diet. Success. You reach your ultimate fitness goal.\n\nJust like gym visits, business-coaching sessions aren\u2019t always easy and they\ncan be a little painful. And just like a personal trainer, a business coach\ncan only help your business if you\u2019re ready for change and willing to admit\nfault\n\nThe coach\u2019s job is to show you the mirror. People often know when something\nisn\u2019t right, but they choose to look past it. A business coach can help you\nidentify your problem and push you to succeed because they bring a\nprofessional, outside perspective, honest feedback and tested strategy to move\nyou to the next level of success.\n\nBefore hiring a business coach, there are five important questions to ask:\n\n  1. Can this coach do what he says he can do? \u2013 Talk with the business coach about his or her abilities, and then ask to talk with his or her clients. Their feedback will give you a greater sense of the coach\u2019s abilities.\n  2. Will this coach actually do what he says he will do? \u2013  Research the coach\u2019s prior clients and look for a track record of success.\n  3. Is this person someone I want to work with? \u2013 Plan an in-person meeting with your prospective coach to make sure you jive. If you hire him or her, you\u2019ll have to work together through challenging discussions and situations to build your team and your business.\n  4. Does this coach serve my genre? \u2013 Find a coach who has experience in your business type. Not necessarily industry-specific, because often times lessons can cary from industry to industry, but more so size specific. Some coaches, like me, focus on entrepreneurial businesses while others work with large corporations. What works for a small $5-20 million business may not apply to a multi-billion dollar corporation.\n  5. Can I afford the time and money required for a coach? \u2013 Prepare to invest in your company\u2019s success. Some coaches charge hourly and cost between $300 and $500 an hour. Others charge monthly and cost between $24,000 and $60,000 a year.\n\nThe cost varies by the amount of contact you receive. Some sessions with your\ncoach may only be an hour long while others last all day. Some coaches meet\nmonthly and others prefer quarterly meetings. Figure out what works for you\nbefore you price it out.\n\nOverall, look for coaches who put the client first.\n\nIn my experience that means he or she doesn\u2019t:\n\n  1. Charge for your service until after the service is performed\n  2. Require you to sign a contract\n  3. Force you to pay what\u2019s on your invoice unless you feel the service warranted the price.\n\nAuthor and motivational speaker Anthony Robbins said: \u201cIf you do what you\u2019ve\nalways done, you\u2019ll get what you\u2019ve always gotten.\u201d\n\nThat statement is especially true when discussing reaching business and\nfitness goals. A coach can help you do more than what you\u2019ve already done, but\nyou must be willing and ready to grow.\n\n\n\nThis article was originally published in Business News Daily.\n\nPhoto credit:  <a\nhref=\u201dhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishunkeler/8856136316/\u201d>Chris\nHunkeler</a> via <a\n\n## Say  \nHello\n\nX\n\n### Join Our Newsletter\n\nFirst name\n\nLast name\n\nEmail*\n\n### Programs\n\n  * Everest\n  * Kilimanjaro\n  * Aravali\n  * Rainier\n  * Matterhorn\n\n### Resources\n\n  * COVID-19\n  * Blog\n  * The Book Shelf\n  * Action Docs\n\n### About Petra\n\n  * Meet the Coaches\n  * Our Story\n  * Careers\n  * Contact Us\n\n### Petra Coach\n\n(888) 330-1020  \n4107 Mallory Lane  \nSuite 301  \nFranklin, TN 37067  \n\n\n\nClose menu\n\n"
