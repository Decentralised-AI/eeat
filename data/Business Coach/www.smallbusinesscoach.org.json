In Alan\u2019s first business after\npersonally experiencing problems with cash flow, customers, employees, debt\nand burnout, he hired a businesscoach who transformed his life and business.\nFrom there his struggling small business grew to a leading company with 130\nemployees and high profits. After selling his business to a publicly-held\ncompany Alan founded Small BusinessCoach Associates and the BusinessCoach\nframework was created to help him overcome obstacles in his own company. The\nprocess resulted in him doubling revenue and profits for three consecutive\nyears.\n\n## Providing Business Coaching Services to Our Business Owner Clients\n\nThen he began to provide the framework through coaching for small businesses.\nSince then over a thousand of Alan\u2019s business coaching clients have\ndramatically increased their revenue and profits after learning the process.\n\nWith the Small BusinessCoach Process, you will: 1.

There is an option to try out working with an advisor prior to\nentering a monthly commitment. With options starting at only $497,business\ncoaching is now within reach of every small business owner.  \n**\n\n# **Small Business Coach Offers Affordable Coaching Packages**\n\nView our Jump Start Programs Here:\n\nStudies show that business executives who employ business coaches experience a\nreturn on investment between 500% and 800%. In other words for every $1 a\nbusiness invests, businesses experience a return of $5 to $8. Although\nbusiness coaching is common for larger businesses, 42% of businesses do not\nutilize a business coach. Likely the high costs to hire a coach has\nhistorically been a factor.\n\nAlan Melton, president of Small Business Coach Associates said, \u201cTypically\none-to-one business coaching sessions are pricey for business owners; they can\nrange from $1500 per month to $5000 per month. We recognize how challenging\nthese economic times are for small business owners and entrepreneurs. Business\nowners need expert assistance now more than ever. Our team wanted to provide\npackages that would give every business owner access to these needed services\nat affordable prices.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe company offers more comprehensive packages for business owners who want\none-to-one coaching. Every package for existing businesses offers a business\nevaluation, a business assessment with recommended actions, and regular\ncoaching sessions. With premium packages _\u201cCoach on Call\u201d_ sessions are\navailable (emergency coaching sessions) where a business coach to guide will\nthem through an important decision.  Also provided in the packages are life\ncoaching, training for the business owner and/or employees, and personality\nprofiles.\n\nCoaching has become commonplace in a large part of our society. From sports\nplayers to actors to singers to large companies, coaching is the norm. For\nexample Tiger Woods employs golf coaches to help him improve. Virtually all\nsuccessful individuals and businesses use advisors.\n\n\u201c\u201dWe interviewed a number of small business owners as we developed the\npackages,\u201d said Melton. \u201cAgain and again we were told that in order to reach\nmost small business owners, the packages needed to be low cost. These packages\nhave been well-received by the business community.\u201d This is an innovative idea\nand good news for small business owners who have weathered the stormy economy,\nincreased taxes and government regulations. Most government officials\nrecognize the fact that small businesses are the engine that powers our\neconomy. With this needed assistance, small business engines may run more\npowerfully.\n\nQuestions about our **small business coaching  ** services?\n\n#### **Call us at 1-888-504-0777,**\n\n**or  **\n\n#### **Enter your information below to start growing your revenues and profits\ntoday\u2026**\n\n  * 400 Memorial Drive Extension Greer, SC 29651\n  * 1-888-504-0777\n  * List Item #3\n\nFacebook-f Twitter Instagram Linkedin\n\n#### About\n\n  * Associates\n  * Founder\n  * Faq's\n\n#### Services\n\n  * Workshop\n  * Valuation\n  * Exit Planning\n\n#### Packages\n\n  * Startup\n  * Grow\n  * Group\n  * One-to-one\n\n  * 400 Memorial Drive Extension Greer, SC 29651\n  * 1-888-504-0777\n\nFacebook-f Twitter Linkedin\n\nServices\n\n  * Business Roadmap\n  * Business Consulting\n  * Our Business Coaches\n\nAbout\n\n  * Recommended Books\n  * Our Mission, Vision & Values\n  * Starting a Business\n\n\u00a9 2024 Small Business Coach All rights reserved.\n\n  * Terms of Use\n\n"
