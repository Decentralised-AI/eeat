However, as\nwith most things in life, having an experienced mentor that you can rely on is\none of the most valuable resources available to business owners.\n\n**You see:**\n\nMost business owners looking for advice on how to grow their company have a\nlimited amount of resources to turn to.\n\nSure, there are countless online articles and Ebooks on how to build and grow\na business, but, at the end of the day, every business is unique and generic\nadvice is hardly a suitable substitute for personalized guidance.\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s now a service where business owners can receive the\npersonalized guidance they need to answer their difficult questions and make\ntheir organization a success \u2013 business coaching.\n\nFREE WEBCAST FROM JACK CANFIELD: Learn How to Become a Business Coach and\nChange Lives\n\n## What is Business Coaching?\n\nBusiness coaches are typically experienced entrepreneurs and business owners\nthemselves who decide to use their talents for building and growing a business\nto help other business owners reach their goals.\n\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of information and advice available online on how to\nstart and grow a business, all of it is, by nature, generic and not specific\nto your unique business. Business coaches, on the other hand, are able to\nprovide something far more valuable \u2013 personalized, custom advice.\n\nIf a person wants to learn how to play an instrument, it\u2019s much easier to find\na teacher than it is to teach themselves.\n\nLikewise, if an athlete wants to improve their skills, the best thing they can\ndo is join a team that has a great coach.\n\nWe apply this logic \u2013 the fact that great coaches and mentors are the quickest\nroutes to success \u2013 to most every pursuit, yet the same logic is often\noverlooked when it comes to growing a business.\n\nBusiness coaches are typically expert entrepreneurs who know what it takes to\nmake a business successful.\n\nFor a fee, they work alongside executives and owners to help them define their\ngoals, polish their vision for their business, and set in place a series of\nstrategies that will help the owner achieve their goals and vision.\n\nIf a business owner has tough questions or runs into problems along the way,\ntheir coach will be able to help them navigate their issues in the most\neffective way possible.\n\nHaving a business coach is much like having a highly experienced partner on\nyour team, and the value that they offer to business owners is priceless.\n\nWhether your business is struggling and you need a way to revive it or you\nsimply want to take your brand to the next level, bringing on a professional\nbusiness coach is one of the most effective options you have available.\n\n### What Does a Business Coach Do?\n\nBusiness coaches serve as both trainers and mentors, training you in the\nskills you need to be successful in your business and serving as a source of\ninformation should you ever have any questions about what you should do.\n\nMuch like any other coach, business coaches work to refine your talents, hone\nyour goals, guide your decisions, and do everything else that they can do to\nensure that you and your business are successful.\n\nBusiness coaches start by learning everything that they can about your brand,\nfrom its value propositions to its target customers to the challenges it will\nface and beyond.\n\nOnce your business coach has learned everything that they can about your\nofferings and systems, they\u2019ll next want to learn more about your vision for\nyour company and the goals that you have for it.\n\nJust as every company is unique, every business owner\u2019s vision is unique as\nwell, and a business coach will need to know whether you are wanting to turn\nyour business into a livable income for you and your family or a multi-million\ndollar corporation.\n\nNext, a business coach will work with you to set beneficial and attainable\ngoals for your team.\n\nThese goals will be ones that you need to hit in order to efficiently grow and\nachieve the vision you lay out.\n\nOnce a set of goals are in place, your business coach is there to help you\nmeet them, aiding you in devising a set of strategies and action plans\ndesigned to push your business to meet its goals and helping you navigate any\nchallenges that come up along the way.\n\nThroughout this entire process, business coaches serve as an invaluable source\nof personalized information and advice.\n\nRunning a business, small or large, can far too often feel like fumbling\naround in the dark hoping you find what you are looking for.\n\nIn this analogy, though, a business coach serves as your flashlight.\n\n### What Can a Business Coach Help With?\n\nMost business coaches are versatile in the services that they offer, meaning\nthat whether you are wanting to revive a struggling business or make an\nalready successful business even more successful or whether you are running a\nsmall, local business or an international company, a talented business coach\nwill be able to help.\n\nThere\u2019s a common perception that business coaching services exist only to help\nowners with struggling or faltering businesses.\n\nWhile helping get them back on the right track is certainly one thing a coach\nis able to help with, there are a wide variety of other situations where\ncoaches can help owners as well.\n\nBusiness coaches can help build a new business from the ground up, advising\nexecutives and owners as they go through the process of setting up their\nbusiness, defining its mission and goals, and putting in place both long-term\nand short-term strategies for the business.\n\nLikewise, a business coach is able to help business owners that have hit a\nplateau in their company\u2019s growth as they figure out how to take their\nbusiness to the next level.\n\nAlong with improving the operation and growth of a business, though, such\ncoaches are also able to ease some of the burdens on owners to make their\njourney easier and more enjoyable.\n\nWhile running your own business can be very rewarding, there\u2019s no denying that\nit can be very demanding and stressful as well. This is doubly true if you are\nrunning an entire company all on your own.\n\nWhen you work with a business coach, however, you\u2019ll have someone in your\ncorner who can assist you through the challenges you will inevitably face and\nserve as a source of experience and expertise that you can rely on when the\ngoing gets tough.\n\nIn this way, they are able to make the lives of owners much less stressful,\nwhich is a priceless benefit in and of itself.\n\n## Is a Small Business Coach Different?\n\nThere are several different labels that business coaches may use to describe\ntheir services, with a small business coach being one of them.\n\nIn many cases, the challenges and goals of small businesses may differ from\nthose of large businesses.\n\nFor example, a restaurant looking to attract more local customers is going to\nhave an entirely different set of goals and strategies than a large\ncorporation that is shipping products out all over the world.\n\nSmall business coaches specialize in helping small business owners achieve\ntheir vision and goals for their company.\n\nWith that said, most business coaches will be experienced in working with\nsmall businesses regardless of whether or not they describe themselves as a\n_\u201csmall business coach\u201d_.\n\nA big part of the job of a business coach is to learn as much they can about\neach company and owner that they are working with and to develop a strategy\nthat is uniquely suited to the specifics of each situation.\n\nIn other words, a high-quality business coach will likely be able to help you\nregardless of company size or how large you want it to grow.\n\n## Famous Entrepreneurs Who Had Business Coaching\n\nIt may come as a surprise to know that even some of the world\u2019s most famous\nand successful business owners and entrepreneurs have relied on business\ncoaches at some point or another to help them meet their goals.\n\nEric Schmidt \u2013 formerly the CEO of Google \u2013 has said before that hiring a\nbusiness coach was the best professional decision he ever made. He admits that\nit took some urging at first, as he was already a successful CEO of a rapidly-\ngrowing company.\n\nNevertheless, after being convinced by a Google board member, Schmidt decided\nto work with a business coach and was amazed by the results. In an interview\nwith Fortune Magazine, Schmidt said, \u201ceveryone needs a coach\u201d.\n\nOther famous executives and entrepreneurs who have benefited from business\ncoaching include Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and countless others.\n\nSuffice it to say that business coaching is a resource that some of the\nworld\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs still swear by to this day.\n\n## A Few Head-Turning Business Coaching Statistics\n\nSatisfied owners who have worked with business coaches to develop and grow\ntheir business are quick to talk about the many benefits and advantages that\nthey enjoyed throughout the process, and several different surveys have been\nconducted highlighting the results of such services.\n\n**Just a few meaningful business coaching statistics from these surveys\ninclude:**\n\nA 2001 study by Manchester Inc. showed that businesses who employed a business\ncoach saw an average return on their investment of 5.7 times the amount that\nthey paid for the coaching services\n\nA report conducted by the Personnel Management Association showed that\nexecutives who received both coaching and training were able to increase their\nproductivity by 86% compared to a _22%_ increase in productivity by executives\nwho received training alone\n\nA Hay Group study showed that _40%_ of Fortune 500 companies make use of\nbusiness coaching to train and develop their executives\n\nA study conducted by MetrixGlobal LLC showed that businesses who paid for\ncoaching saw a $7.90 return for every $1.00 spent on those services\n\n_53%_ of business owners and executives report that it increased their\nproductivity\n\n_61%_ of owners report that it increased their job satisfaction\n\n_23%_ of executives report that business coaching helped them reduce\noperational costs\n\n_22%_ of companies report that business coaching increased their profitability\n\n_67%_ of business owners and executives report that business coaching\nincreased their work skills within their business\n\nStatistics such as these shine a spotlight on the real-world value that\nbusiness coaching is able to offer.\n\nLike anything else your business spends money on, coaching services are an\ninvestment \u2013 on that surveys and studies show time and time again to deliver\nsignificant returns in a variety of key areas.\n\n\n\n## Common Business Coaching Questions\n\nBusiness owners who are considering hiring a coach often have a lot of\nquestions.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve already covered many of these questions such as what business\ncoaches do and how much they charge, here are a few more frequently asked\nquestions regarding their services:\n\n**_Q: What is the first meeting with a business coach like?_**\n\n**A:** When you first meet with your business coach, the number one priority\nis going to be for the coach to learn more about you and your business so that\nthey can specifically tailor their advice to help you.\n\nYou can expect a friendly encounter and an enjoyable discussion about your\nbusiness that will eventually transform into your business coach offering you\nspecialized advice about the goals that you should set for your business and\nhow you should go about meeting those goals.\n\n**_Q: Can business coaches help me grow my business?_**\n\n**A:** Business coaches can certainly help you put strategies in place to grow\nyour business if that is your goal.\n\nHowever, growing companies is not the only service that business coaching\nprovides.\n\nSuch coaches also work to help make you more productive, make your job and\nrunning your business easier, and help you achieve all aspects of your vision\nfor your company, including but not limited to its growth.\n\n**_Q: Can small businesses benefit from business coaching?_**\n\n**A:** Small businesses are certainly able to benefit from business coaching,\nperhaps even more so than large corporations.\n\nThe issue is that many small business owners are not able to afford or access\ntop-quality coaching. This is why we\u2019ve designed _Black Card Business\nCoaching_ to be a program that is affordable and accessible to all types of\nowners, small business owners included.\n\n## Are You Looking to Become a Business Coach or Life Coach?\n\nMy good friend **Jack Canfield is offering a free webcast** that has the\npotential to transform your life and your career.\n\nHave you ever thought about becoming a business coach or consultant?\n\nDo you have a message that you think will influence others to make positive\nchanges in their lives?\n\nDo you want to start your own coaching business?\n\nIf you said, \u201cYes\u201d to any of these things, this webcast is for you.
