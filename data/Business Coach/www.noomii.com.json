Business coaching can help businesses of all sizes come up with\nsolutions, strategies, and action plans for attaining their goals.\n\n### What are the benefits of business coaching?\n\n**Company Benefits -** Companies can benefit from business coaching by\nachieving a better corporate culture, more open and productive communication,\nhigher levels of productivity, increased profit, and business expansion.\n\n**Individual Benefits -** Individual business owners, leaders, and employees\ncan benefit from Business Coaching by improving interpersonal and relationship\nskills, increasing self-confidence, learning time management strategies, and\nenjoying a healthier work-life balance.\n\n### How do I find the right business coach?\n\nA common misconception about business coaches is that they must be experts in\nyour field. While many business coaches possess extensive business knowledge\nand experience, they need not be experts in your line of business to deliver\nquality coaching services. The underlying philosophy of business coaching is\nthat the individuals within the company participating in the coaching, whether\nyou are the CEO or the front-line staff, are the experts in your business. The\nrole of the coach is to help you come up with your own solutions, strategies\nand an action plan for improving the business.\n\nAll too often, a perfect action plan is created but there is little to no\nfollow-through. A business coach offers objective, unbiased accountability to\nexecute the plan, learn from the outcomes, revise the plan and take further\naction. A good business coach will also help create accountability structures\nthat will encourage individuals to take consistent action to improve their\nperformance and the overall performance of the company.\n\n### I am a solopreneur. Can a business coach help me?\n\nOf course! Business coaches can help businesses of all sizes grow and improve\ntheir performance.\n\n### I need help with advertising/marketing/social media presence. Is this\nsomething a business coach can help with?\n\nYes. Many business coaches specialize in specific areas of business growth,\nincluding advertising, marketing, social media presence, e-commerce, brand\nmanagement, etc.\n\n### Need help?\n\nIf you need help finding a coach, you can always get a free coach\nrecommendation from a Noomii coach matching expert.\n\nLearn more about business coaching.\n\nRead more Read less\n\n## Find the right coaches for your business.\n\nGet Coach Recommendations Now!\n\n### Filter by Location\n\n#### United States\n\n  * United States\n  * Alabama (15)\n  * Alaska (1)\n  * Arizona (21)\n  * Arkansas (5)\n  * California (170)\n  * Colorado (48)\n  * Connecticut (15)\n  * Delaware (5)\n  * District of Columbia (4)\n  * Florida (111)\n  * Georgia (56)\n  * Hawaii (3)\n  * Idaho (4)\n  * Illinois (30)\n  * Indiana (10)\n  * Iowa (5)\n\n  * Kansas (7)\n  * Kentucky (11)\n  * Louisiana (10)\n  * Maine (4)\n  * Maryland (20)\n  * Massachusetts (25)\n  * Michigan (19)\n  * Minnesota (10)\n  * Mississippi (2)\n  * Missouri (6)\n  * Montana (3)\n  * Nebraska (3)\n  * Nevada (9)\n  * New Hampshire (5)\n  * New Jersey (49)\n  * New Mexico (4)\n  * New York (69)\n\n  * North Carolina (41)\n  * North Dakota (1)\n  * Ohio (31)\n  * Oklahoma (8)\n  * Oregon (30)\n  * Pennsylvania (35)\n  * Rhode Island (6)\n  * South Carolina (9)\n  * Tennessee (17)\n  * Texas (75)\n  * Utah (15)\n  * Vermont (7)\n  * Virginia (37)\n  * Washington (38)\n  * Wisconsin (14)\n  * Wyoming (3)\n\n#### Canada\n\n  * Canada\n  * Alberta (29)\n  * British Columbia (40)\n  * Manitoba (3)\n  * New Brunswick (2)\n  * Newfoundland and Labrador (1)\n  * Nova Scotia (1)\n  * Ontario (86)\n  * Prince Edward Island (1)\n  * Quebec (19)\n  * Saskatchewan (9)\n\n#### Other Countries\n\nSee all countries\n\nDisplaying business coach 1-20 of 2711\n\n####  Russ Katzman MBA, Certified Mentor, Certified Project Management\nProfessional, Certified Change Management Professional, Lean Six Sigma Black\nBelt, CSM, CISA\n\nBusiness Coach, Entrepreneurship Coach, Executive Coach\n\n10.0 Noomii Score\n\nRated 5.0 out of 5 __________ 18 reviews\n\nAbove all, my clients are passionate about the future.

We think it\u2019s expensive because we have all heard of the coaches\n\n_\n\nIt\u2019s funny how many people think that hiring a business coach is very\nexpensive. We think it\u2019s expensive because we have all heard of the\ncoaches/consultants that charge $25 \u2013 30k a year, with results ranging from\n\u201cworth every penny\u201d to \u201ccomplete waste of time and money\u201d. In actuality,\nhiring a coach can range in price, and many are pleasantly surprised to find\nout how affordable it really can be.\n\nHow much does it cost to hire a business coach? Ok, the indirect answer is\nthat it varies. Some charge anywhere form $500 \u2013 $30,000 annually. I\u2019ve even\nmet a coach that says he charges $50k annually. Some charge an initiation fee,\nand some don\u2019t. Initiation fees can range $500 \u2013 $5000. I bet your thinking,\n\u201cnot really helpful yet, please answer the question\u201d. I will, I just wanted to\ngive you a picture of what you can expect.\n\nWhy the range in price?\n\nThe simple answer is that it depends on what you want, how much you need from\nthe coach, and how much experience they have.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why so many people shy away from this.\n\nIs the fee relative to the experience, service and results I will receive?\n\nNo, as I mentioned in the beginning of this article. We have all heard of the\nbusiness coach that charged $25k and didn\u2019t help a bit, and the coach that\ncharged $25k and helped turn the company around. On the other end of the\nspectrum, some coaches charge $50 \u2013 $200 per hour with the same feedback. So,\ndon\u2019t base your decision on the price alone.\n\nHow should I base my decision?\n\nThe easy answer to this question is to base this buying decision, the same way\nyou would buy a car.\n\n-Why are you buying it? Are you looking for practicality, prestige, safety, price, need something?  \n-What do you need? The works? The basics? Something in between? Don\u2019t care?  \n-How are you paying for it? Cash? Down payment and Financing? 100% financing? Can\u2019t afford?\n\nIf you are looking for prestige, the works and you have unlimited income. You\nprobably will want to hire the $25k \u2013 $50k coach. They will have all the bells\nand whistles\n\n-Well-known brand -A licensed platform -Lots of tools and dashboards \\- Ivy league educated advisors that spent some portion of their career as a corporate executive \\- Meetings that require travel \\- class A office space \\- Advertises specific industry knowledge -Have tiered offerings -Hiring them is a badge of honor \n\nIf you are looking for Practicality, something in between, and can finance.\nYou will probably want to hire the $150 \u2013 $700 a month coach\n\n\\- Usually local, but can also work virtual \\- In business for a while \\-\nSomewhat known \\- Some tools \\- B or C class office space \\- Advertise\nindustry knowledge \\- Follow a less formal curriculum \\- Structured \\- Have\ndifferent products to choose from\n\nIf you are looking for the basics at a limited budget. $50 \u2013 $125 per month\n\n-Local -Newer to the industry \\- Home office -Less structured -Worked as an executive or middle management prior to opening a practice \\- Solopreneur \n\nDon\u2019t have any money, but need something\n\n-There are free programs offered through government, or colleges and universities -SCORE is a national program -Sometimes the D.O.L. or local job boards have programs available -On line: Blogs, podcasts, articles, forums can also be helpful -Purchase a Business book \n\nBut you didn\u2019t tell me which is the best option\u2026\n\nAt each level there are the good ones and there are the bad ones. Hopefully,\nyou don\u2019t spend $30k on a bad one.\n\n-Start with identifying which level and price point you are looking for -Interview them. Do you feel comfortable? -Do they have a track record of results? Do they have testimonials? Are people talking about the things they have done? -Do they speak a language you understand? You don\u2019t need to feel stupid when you are with them. -Do you believe or trust them? -What is included in the fee they are asking? Let\u2019s face it, if you buy a car, you hope it comes with brakes, a motor, seats, doors and a steering wheel. -Do they ask for a long-term commitment? Are you comfortable with that? -If they have a contract, and it doesn\u2019t\u2019 go well, can you get out of the contract? -Do they have experience? -Where did they get their experience? -Do they practice what they preach? -Can you afford it, or will it be stressful every time they draft a payment? (If you buy something you can\u2019t afford, you won\u2019t be able to give the relationship what it properly needs and want to rush the process.) -What is their confidentiality policy? -Will you work with the same person/team every time? Can you choose who you work with and who you don\u2019t work with? -Can you add or remove time with ease? Let\u2019s say you initially buy weekly coaching, but want to change it to monthly coaching, can you change your mind part way through the relationship? -What will they do for you? Some coaches will only coach. Some will come in to evaluate and give you a report. Some will help you implement on projects. \\- How much time will be asked of you? If you choose to work with a coach, they will ask you to put time and effort into executing on your goals and getting the most out of the relationship. They may even suggest other activities that will help you achieve the results you are looking for. Watch out for organizations that demand attendance and time to activities that aren\u2019t in that realm. Have the \u201cWhat\u2019s expected of me conversation\u201d. \\- Will you be held accountable? \n\nAt the Entrepreneur Circle we fall in the practicality realm.
