Here is a list of our partners and here's how we\nmake money.\n\nFollow the writer\n\nYou\u2019re following Rosalie Murphy  \nVisit your My NerdWallet Settings page to see all the writers you're\nfollowing.\n\nMORE LIKE THISSmall Business\n\nAt its best, business coaching can connect you with a mentor and supporter who\nhelps you generate ideas, make plans and execute on them.\n\nBut at its worst, a business coaching offer can cost you time, energy and\nmoney \u2014 without much to show for it.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from a business coach, how to find a coach that suits\nyou and how to spot red flags.\n\nSmart money moves for your business\n\nGrow your small business with tailored insights, recommendations, and expert\ncontent.\n\nLet's Go\n\n## What a business coach can do\n\nBusiness coaches draw on their professional experience to help you set and\nachieve your own business goals.\n\n\u201cI'm here to help you, and I'm here to raise your level of knowledge in\nwhatever way I can,\u201d says Gary Robinson, who chairs the Memphis, Tennessee,\nchapter of SCORE. SCORE offers free business mentoring for entrepreneurs\nnationwide.\n\nSome ways a business coach or mentor might do this include:\n\n  * Offering feedback on your ideas and suggesting new ones.\n\n  * Giving you templates and other tools that help you make plans.\n\n  * Connecting you with resources in your region or your industry.\n\n  * Giving you deadlines and holding you accountable to them.\n\nSome business coaches may also offer coursework or group training sessions on\nparticular topics, like sales.\n\nWorking with a coach should help you identify opportunities you hadn\u2019t seen\nbefore or develop new strategies for pursuing those opportunities, says Sophia\nSunwoo, who coaches women and nonbinary entrepreneurs through Ascent Strategy,\nher New York City-based firm.\n\n\u201c[Coaches] don't necessarily have to have all the answers,\u201d Sunwoo says. \u201cBut\nthey are the people that know how to maneuver and create a bunch of different\nthinking paths for their clients.\u201d\n\n## What a business coach can\u2019t do\n\nA business coach isn\u2019t the same as a consultant, whom you would hire to\nperform a specific task. A coach or mentor could look over your business plan,\nfor example, but they wouldn\u2019t write it for you.\n\n\u201cIf you were to hire me as a consultant, you would expect me to roll up my\nsleeves and pitch in and work with you to get things done, and you would pay\nme for that,\u201d Robinson says. Coaches, on the other hand, \u201ctry to show you how\nto do things so that you can do them [yourself].\u201d\n\nBusiness coaches are also not therapists, Sunwoo says. Entrepreneurship can be\nemotionally and mentally taxing, but it\u2019s important that coaches refer clients\nto mental health professionals when necessary.\n\n## Business coaching red flags\n\nIf a business coaching opportunity \u201cpromises guaranteed income, large returns,\nor a \u2018proven system,\u2019 it\u2019s likely a scam,\u201d the Federal Trade Commission warned\nin a December 2020 notice.\n\nIn 2018, the FTC took legal action against My Online Business Education and\nDigital Altitude, which purported to help entrepreneurs start online\nbusinesses. The FTC alleged these companies charged participants more and more\nmoney to work through their programs, with few customers earning the promised\nreturns.\n\nIn both cases, these operations paid settlements, and the FTC issued refunds\nto tens of thousands of their customers in 2021 and 2022.\n\nTo avoid offers like these, the FTC recommends that you:\n\n  * Be wary of anyone who tries to upsell you right away or pressures you to make a quick decision.\n\n  * Search for reviews of the person or organization online.\n\n  * Research your coach\u2019s background to see if they\u2019ve accomplished as much as they say.\n\nSunwoo says to also be skeptical of one-size-fits-all solutions. A coach\nshould customize their advice to your personality and skill set, not ask you\nto conform to theirs.\n\n\u201cThe moment that a business coach pushes you to do something that is really\nnot compatible with your personality or your beliefs or values,\u201d Sunwoo says,\n\u201cthat\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d\n\n## How to find the right coach \u2014 maybe for free\n\nHere\u2019s how to find a coach that will be as helpful as possible.\n\nDetermine whether you need advice or to hire someone. A coach isn\u2019t the right\nfit for every business owner. If you need hands-on help organizing your\nbusiness finances, for instance, you may need a bookkeeping service or\naccountant. And take legal questions to an attorney.\n\nSeek out the right expertise. A good coach should be aware of what they don\u2019t\nknow. If they\u2019re not a good fit for your needs \u2014 whether that\u2019s expertise in a\nparticular industry or a specialized skill set, like marketing \u2014 they might be\nable to refer you to someone who\u2019s a better fit.\n\nConsider free options. There may be some in your city or region:\n\n  * SCORE offers free in-person and virtual mentoring in all 50 states, plus Guam, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.\n\n  * See if your city has a Small Business Development Center, Veterans Business Outreach Center or a Women\u2019s Business Center. All are funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and offer free training and advising for entrepreneurs.\n\n  * Do an online search for city- or state-specific programs. Philadelphia, for example, offers a business coaching program designed for entrepreneurs who want to qualify for particular business loan programs.

SCORE offers free business mentoring for entrepreneurs\nnationwide.\n\nSome ways a business coach or mentor might do this include:\n\n  * Offering feedback on your ideas and suggesting new ones.\n\n  * Giving you templates and other tools that help you make plans.\n\n  * Connecting you with resources in your region or your industry.\n\n  * Giving you deadlines and holding you accountable to them.\n\nSome business coaches may also offer coursework or group training sessions on\nparticular topics, like sales.\n\nWorking with a coach should help you identify opportunities you hadn\u2019t seen\nbefore or develop new strategies for pursuing those opportunities, says Sophia\nSunwoo, who coaches women and nonbinary entrepreneurs through Ascent Strategy,\nher New York City-based firm.\n\n\u201c[Coaches] don't necessarily have to have all the answers,\u201d Sunwoo says. \u201cBut\nthey are the people that know how to maneuver and create a bunch of different\nthinking paths for their clients.\u201d\n\n## What a business coach can\u2019t do\n\nA business coach isn\u2019t the same as a consultant, whom you would hire to\nperform a specific task. A coach or mentor could look over your business plan,\nfor example, but they wouldn\u2019t write it for you.\n\n\u201cIf you were to hire me as a consultant, you would expect me to roll up my\nsleeves and pitch in and work with you to get things done, and you would pay\nme for that,\u201d Robinson says. Coaches, on the other hand, \u201ctry to show you how\nto do things so that you can do them [yourself].\u201d\n\nBusiness coaches are also not therapists, Sunwoo says. Entrepreneurship can be\nemotionally and mentally taxing, but it\u2019s important that coaches refer clients\nto mental health professionals when necessary.\n\n## Business coaching red flags\n\nIf a business coaching opportunity \u201cpromises guaranteed income, large returns,\nor a \u2018proven system,\u2019 it\u2019s likely a scam,\u201d the Federal Trade Commission warned\nin a December 2020 notice.\n\nIn 2018, the FTC took legal action against My Online Business Education and\nDigital Altitude, which purported to help entrepreneurs start online\nbusinesses. The FTC alleged these companies charged participants more and more\nmoney to work through their programs, with few customers earning the promised\nreturns.\n\nIn both cases, these operations paid settlements, and the FTC issued refunds\nto tens of thousands of their customers in 2021 and 2022.\n\nTo avoid offers like these, the FTC recommends that you:\n\n  * Be wary of anyone who tries to upsell you right away or pressures you to make a quick decision.\n\n  * Search for reviews of the person or organization online.\n\n  * Research your coach\u2019s background to see if they\u2019ve accomplished as much as they say.\n\nSunwoo says to also be skeptical of one-size-fits-all solutions. A coach\nshould customize their advice to your personality and skill set, not ask you\nto conform to theirs.\n\n\u201cThe moment that a business coach pushes you to do something that is really\nnot compatible with your personality or your beliefs or values,\u201d Sunwoo says,\n\u201cthat\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d\n\n## How to find the right coach \u2014 maybe for free\n\nHere\u2019s how to find a coach that will be as helpful as possible.\n\nDetermine whether you need advice or to hire someone. A coach isn\u2019t the right\nfit for every business owner. If you need hands-on help organizing your\nbusiness finances, for instance, you may need a bookkeeping service or\naccountant. And take legal questions to an attorney.\n\nSeek out the right expertise. A good coach should be aware of what they don\u2019t\nknow. If they\u2019re not a good fit for your needs \u2014 whether that\u2019s expertise in a\nparticular industry or a specialized skill set, like marketing \u2014 they might be\nable to refer you to someone who\u2019s a better fit.\n\nConsider free options. There may be some in your city or region:\n\n  * SCORE offers free in-person and virtual mentoring in all 50 states, plus Guam, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.\n\n  * See if your city has a Small Business Development Center, Veterans Business Outreach Center or a Women\u2019s Business Center. All are funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and offer free training and advising for entrepreneurs.\n\n  * Do an online search for city- or state-specific programs. Philadelphia, for example, offers a business coaching program designed for entrepreneurs who want to qualify for particular business loan programs. Business incubators often offer courses or coaching.\n\nMake sure your coach is invested in you. They should take the time to learn\nabout you, your business and its unique needs, then leverage their own\nexperiences and creativity to help you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on your team now,\u201d Robinson says of his clients. \u201cLet\u2019s do this together\nand make this a success.\u201d\n\nAbout the author\n\nRosalie Murphy\n\nFollow\n\nYou\u2019re following Rosalie Murphy  \nVisit your My NerdWallet Settings page to see all the writers you're\nfollowing.\n\nnew\n\nFollow for more nerdy know-how\n\nKeep up with your favorite financial topics on NerdWallet.\n\nRosalie Murphy is a small-business writer at NerdWallet.
