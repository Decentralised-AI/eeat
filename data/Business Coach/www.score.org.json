You can enter your zip code in the box\nabove and complete the mentoring request form to be paired with a local\nexpert. If there is specific expertise you're looking for, you can use the\nMentor Matchmaker to find an expert based on industry or subject matter\nexpertise.  \n  \nOnce you\u2019ve submitted your mentoring request, your mentor will contact you by\nemail to schedule an appointment for your mentoring session. We can work with\nyou using different communication methods, including phone, video, email and\nin-person meetings.  \n  \nDuring the session, you'll discuss your business goals and challenges. Your\nmentor will ask you questions about what\u2019s working in your business (and\nwhat\u2019s not) and will seek to understand what you\u2019re hoping to achieve in\nworking with them. They will provide answers to your business questions,\nconnect you to local and national resources, and will recommend workshops and\nevents to help you fill any knowledge gaps that might exist.  \n  \nIf at any point, you need a different expert \u2013 because you need different\nexpertise or if you don\u2019t feel your mentor is the best fit \u2013 you can request\nadditional support from other SCORE mentors in our network.  \n  \nWe can provide support for a simple business question or work with you through\ncomplex business challenges. You can with your mentor(s) as often as you need,\nfor the life of your business. We provide support for all stages of the\nbusiness lifecycle. This means that we\u2019re here to help you if you\u2019re thinking\nabout starting a business, managing a business, growing your business, selling\nor exiting your business.  \n  \nTo get started, simply use our mentor search or enter your zip code in the\nfield above to complete a mentoring request. This will be sent to the\nappropriate mentor or chapter who will respond within 48 hours.\n\n#### How will you match me with my mentor?\n\nWhen you enter your zip code in the field above, you\u2019ll be taken to our\nmentoring request form. We\u2019ll use the information that you provide in that\nform to find your ideal expert. More specifically, we\u2019ll work to understand\nyour business question(s) and compare that to the mentor profiles in our\ndatabase to find an expert that matches your needs.  \n  \nIf you have a more general question, we\u2019ll pair you with a local expert who\ncan work with you to identify your area of greatest need and will coach you on\nthat topic. If necessary, your mentor will invite other SCORE subject matter\nexperts to help if you have questions on several different topics.\n\n#### How long will it take to get matched?\n\nThe time to get matched varies based on your business question, but typically\nyou should hear from a mentor within 48 hours. Once you hear from your mentor,\nyou can work with them to schedule your first mentoring appointment at a time\nthat is convenient for both of your schedules.\n\n#### Will my mentor reach out to me first?\n\nYes! Your mentor will attempt to contact you 3 times upon receiving your\nmentoring request. They will email you and text you (if you select text\nnotifications), so make sure you check your junk folders and whitelist emails\nsent from @scorevolunteer.org and @score.org.\n\n#### Is SCORE mentoring confidential? Can my mentor sign a Nondisclosure\nAgreement (NDA)?\n\nClient confidentiality is an institutional principle at SCORE. This means that\na SCORE client\u2019s confidentiality does not reside with a single volunteer or\nchapter but is maintained as confidential within SCORE.  \n  \nSCORE volunteers cannot sign any client\u2019s confidentiality agreements or any\nNon-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), but the client\u2019s confidentiality is covered\nin the volunteer\u2019s agreement with SCORE.  \n  \nThis agreement to maintain client confidentiality - as well as other values\nthat are integral to the client relationship - is confirmed in writing in the\nSCORE Code of Ethics. Among other things, our Code of Ethics directs our\nvolunteers as follows:\n\n  * Always place the business interests of SCORE clients first.\n  * Protect the confidentiality of all client information so that it remains within SCORE.\n\nAll SCORE mentors are required to sign this agreement annually.\n\n#### What industries do you support?\n\nSCORE mentors can help businesses in all industries. We have experts in a\nvariety of fields, including professional services, retail, arts,\nentertainment, recreation, food services, accommodations, travel, marketing &\nadvertising, health care, social assistance, real estate and more.  \n  \nRegardless of your industry, our mentors are knowledgeable in all areas of\nbusiness and can answer your questions about popular topics such as sales,\nmarketing, finance, accounting, management, and technology.\n\n#### What is a typical mentoring session like?\n\nA mentoring session is a confidential, personalized conversation with a\nbusiness expert to answer a question or to solve a problem that you\u2019re facing.  \n  \nSCORE mentoring sessions are collaborative meetings between the small business\nowner and the SCORE mentor. They are typically scheduled for an hour and can\nbe held virtually, through online meetings, phone calls, email, or even in\nperson if you would like to be paired with a local mentor. You can share your\nbusiness goals, progress, challenges, and questions during these sessions.\nSCORE mentors will offer advice, resources, and insights so you gain clarity\non your next best steps.  \n  \nWhen you first meet with your mentor, they will ask you questions about your\nbusiness and your goals. This will help them understand how to best support\nyou and answer your business questions. They will leverage their personal\nexperience and knowledge to help you avoid common challenges and mistakes. If\nthey do not have the expertise you need, they may invite another mentor to\nparticipate in the meeting.  \n  \nOnce you discuss your initial business question, they may ask you to complete\nbusiness templates or to review resources on SCORE.org. Additionally, they may\nrecommend SCORE or partner workshops or resources to meet your needs. They\nwill also schedule a follow-up session to ensure you\u2019re on the right track and\nto keep supporting your business.\n\n#### How can I make the most of my mentoring experience?\n\nTo make the most of your mentoring experience, we recommend being prepared\nwith a business question or challenge that you can work on with your mentor.\nIf you\u2019re starting a business, we recommend being prepared with a business\nidea before you request a mentor. If you\u2019re not sure what type of business you\nwant to start, consider using our Startup Roadmap to help you define your\nbusiness idea. If you already own a business, come to your meeting prepared\nwith the issue you need to resolve or the goal that you\u2019d like to achieve.  \n  \nOther tips to make the most of your mentoring include:\n\n  * Checking your inbox for emails from SCORE.\n  * Be ready to actively participate in your session. This means bringing specific questions that we can answer, engaging in discussions about your business, and challenging the mentor's ideas & suggestions if you don't fully understand them.\n  * If your business is already in operation, please be willing to share your history, recent financials, cash flow, and business plan. This will give your mentor a much-needed understanding of your current operations so they can suggest ideas about how/where to improve.\n  * Be open and honest in the discussion.\n  * Be willing to meet with your mentor over a period of time. Many of the questions that we receive will take more than one meeting to answer. Remember, mentoring is always free and you can meet with your mentor as often as needed (based on schedule and availability).\n  * Keep in mind that SCORE mentors will not do the work for you. We are here as guides and advisors but we\u2019ll ask you to do the work. This is to help you develop the skills and knowledge needed to manage your business.\n  * When you\u2019ve achieved success with your mentor, submit a success story for our website. This will allow us to celebrate your accomplishments and spread the word about your business. Your story could be featured in SCORE\u2019s national media releases and marketing efforts, which will build awareness for your business.\n  * Consider attending a SCORE workshop to complement your mentoring. We offer educational webinars, workshops and events online and in your local community. This will help you strengthen your knowledge and expand your business network.\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nCONNECT\n\n1165 Herndon Parkway, Suite 100\n\n}\n\nHerndon, VA 20170\n\n1-800-634-0245\n\nSign up for SCORE's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SCORE Association, SCORE.org\n\nFunded, in part, through a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration.
