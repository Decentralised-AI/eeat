It seems there might have been a mistake in your request, as the placeholders `{}` are empty and do not provide any specific information about the SEO tools, their pricing plans, or features to compare. To create a comparison review, I would need the names of the SEO tools (e.g., Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz), their respective pricing plans, and a list of features to compare.

If you can provide the necessary details, I can create a comparison table for you. Here's an example of how the markdown table would look with hypothetical data:

```markdown
| Feature / Tool | SEO Eat Plan A | SEO Eat Plan B | SEO Eat Plan C |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Monthly Price  | $99            | $199           | $399           |
| Annual Price   | $990           | $1,990         | $3,990         |
| Keyword Research | Yes          | Yes            | Yes            |
| Backlink Analysis | Up to 10,000 | Up to 50,000  | Up to 100,000  |
| Site Audits    | Up to 5        | Up to 20       | Unlimited      |
| Page Crawls    | Up to 100,000  | Up to 500,000  | Up to 1,500,000|
| User Seats     | 1              | 3              | 5              |
| Support        | Email          | Email + Chat   | Email + Chat + Phone |
```

Please provide the specific details for the SEO tools you want to compare, and I'll be happy to create a detailed comparison review for you.
