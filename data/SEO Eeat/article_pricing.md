I'm sorry, but it seems there might have been a typo or misunderstanding in your request. You mentioned "SEO Eeat," which doesn't correspond to a known product or service. If you meant "SEO tools" or a specific SEO software, please provide the correct names of the SEO tools or services you would like to compare, along with their pricing plans and features.

Once I have the correct information, I can create a comparison review for you. If you have specific SEO tools in mind, please list them, and if possible, provide the details of their pricing plans and key features.
