I've been a\nmember at Office Evolution Bellevue since April 2021, and we have Greetly on\nan iPad in the front lobby. It's a GREAT tool. Greetly solves a major pain\npoint for businesses greeting face to face visitors... employees overworked\nand understaffed: Greetly is always on, always ready to welcome visitors,\nnotify members, and record traffic. I love it.** \"  \n  \n\nGreetly has 75 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/5 stars\n\n## How Our Visitor Management System Makes Your Workplace Smarter\n\nIn addition to allowing initial access to the premises or building, visitor\nmanagement applications provide a more comprehensive visitor access control\nsystem. This system governs the whole process in allowing or disallowing\naccess to an individual, where they can go, and what they can do.\n\nThe sign in app is just one part of the entire visitor management procedure.\nFor the system to be fully effective, it needs to be capable of focusing on\nthe areas of security that are of high priority for the organization. The\nfollowing are the most useful features offered by a comprehensive visitor\nmanagement program:\n\n### **Preregistration and Pre-Appointment Confirmations**\n\nA great visitor experience starts well before that person arrives at your\nworkplace. Rather, as soon as a host decides to invite a guest, your visitor\nmanagement system should get to work. Preregistering visitors should be fast\nand happen within the tools your employees are already using, like their\nOutlook or Google calendar. Guests can then receive a warm pre-appointment\ninvitation, including the address of your workplace, driving and transit\ndirections, and what to do upon arrival. Check-in should be one click away. Of\ncourse, tracking the visitor experience also starts the moment they are\nregistered. When your reception software incorporates appointment\nconfirmations, admin staff, security teams, and all employees will have\nadditional information to use in order to quickly process each guest and give\nthem a warm welcome.\n\n### **Nondisclosure Agreement Acknowledgment and Signatures**\n\nThe NDA is another part of the entry process that many businesses use today.\nAfter all, your worksite houses people collaborating on future plans and IT\nequipment with your most important intellectual property. This type of\nagreement goes beyond the entry process and provides more specific\nrestrictions on what the visitor can and cannot share once they have left the\npremises. A visitor management system should capture electronic signatures on\nNDAs and store them in the cloud or push them to your servers.\n\n### **Visitor Handoff**\n\nDifferent organizations carry out this step in various ways, but visitors in\nlarger premises are often escorted to the location of their host contact. This\nstep provides an added layer of security not only for the facility but for the\npersonnel within. Another approach is to ensure that the guest is\nknowledgeable of their assigned area by providing them with precise directions\nor a map.\n\n###\n\n### **Entry Process**\n\nThis step normally involves a sign in app or registration that can include the\nuse of a keycard, badge, or other access tokens. More advanced systems\nincorporate screening tools for facial recognition, personal identification or\ninformation, or other methods for identity validation.\n\n### **Temporary Access Control**\n\nSome visitors may require access to secure locations while staying on the\npremises to complete various business tasks. Some organizations provide guests\nwith temporary access control. Maybe it allows them to open one door once. Or\na series of doors, with access to an elevator bank and the parking garage for\nthe entirety of their stay. Access controls credentials can be turned off at a\nscheduled time or at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\n### Used by Leading Brands From Around the World\n\n## How Our Visitor Management System Works\n\n\n\n#### A Visitor Signs Themself In\n\nUpon arrival, visitors check themselves in. They can use a kiosk or go\n_touchless_ using their own smartphone.

With our highly customizable check in app, notifications\ncan be sent through text, email, phone call, Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Google\nHangouts.

You can even save your favorite reports.\n\n## Why Is Visitor Management Important?\n\nThe traditional, paper-based _visitor management systems_ that were used in\nthe past are no longer an effective means of keeping track of guests. Besides\nnot being private, they were impersonal, required manual data entry to\ndigitize, and generally were time-consuming and difficult to manage. What a\nwaste.\n\nUsing a modern and comprehensive visitor management software, such as our\nsolution at Greetly, can provide organizations with numerous benefits. Here\nare several major advantages why all businesses today should replace their\nlegacy processes and use a digital sign in app.\n\n### It Reinforces Your Brand\n\nModern _visitor management software_ applications provide organizations with a\nway to reinforce their branding from the moment a guest enters their reception\narea. Greetly will only show your brand logo, colors, and otherwise met your\nbranding guidelines. In fact, all text can be customized to showcase your\nbrand tone and personality.\n\n### Impress Your Visitors\n\nWas it Albert Einstein who said you only get one chance to make a great first\nimpression? Maybe he was too busy working on his theory of relativity, but\nit's still very accurate. And especially true for brands that aim to provide\ntheir guests with unique and memorable experiences. No matter the size of the\norganization, an ideal visitor management solution can provide them with the\nability to make professional, lasting first impressions for everyone that\nenters their premises.\n\n### Improved Office Efficiency\n\nVisitor management solutions such as our Greetly platform allow users to\ncreate and design unique workflows. With features such as custom visitor\ncheck-in process flows, lightning-fast host notifications, being able to\ncreate badges, maintaining compliance, capturing digital signed NDAs and other\ndocuments, and creating and pulling reports check-in times can be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nPreregistration forms may even be used and sent to third parties before their\nscheduled appointment to further streamline the whole check-in process. After\ncompleting the preregistration processes on their own time and devices,\nvisitors that arrive on-site can skip the wait and only need to scan a QR code\nto complete their check-in.\n\n### Enhanced Data Security\n\nTo make sure that sensitive company information remains confidential and\nsecure, visitor management system settings can be configured to limit data\naccess visitor data. Forget the old paper logbook you would flip through to\nsee who else was onsite, Greetly offers best-in-class user privacy, data\nsecurity, and GDPR compliance. Not only can visitors not see who entered\nbefore them, but with different user roles, Greetly can restrict visitor\ninformation to certain staff members, like management, admin, and security\npersonnel. This restriction of information can help you prevent potential\nbreaches since only a few, trusted individuals can access personally\nidentifiable information (PII).\n\n### Modern Reception\n\nThere is a huge difference between utilizing the outdated guest log and a\ncomprehensive visitor management system. Not only is the latter more\nconvenient and easy to use, but it\u2019s also more efficient and effective\noverall.\n\n### Reduced Waiting Times\n\nThe host notification feature of visitor management systems can effectively\nreduce the waiting times for organization visitors. These instant\nnotifications are extremely useful in modern visitor management for both the\nhosts and visitors alike. With media options such as notifications through\ntext and email, companies can stay updated with their visitors while providing\nthem with several communication options. This allows your team to be notified\neven when they are away from their desk.\n\n### Better On-Site Transparency\n\nWith automated third-party interaction records as well as check-in data,\norganizations can develop insights that they can use internally and\nexternally. For instance, authorized staff can create various reports\naccording to the capabilities of the system and the information obtained.\n\nSuch reports can be beneficial in a situation where on-site arrival and\ndeparture from secure locations are necessary. On-site transparency can be\nimproved particularly when each visitor can be scrutinized based on how many\ntimes they entered and left and whom they met within the premises.\n\n### Efficient Contractor Management\n\nManaging contractors isn\u2019t always a walk in the park, especially where time-\non-site and access levels are concerned. In most instances, traditional\nvisitor management procedures simply trust contractors to stay within areas\nwhere they are authorized without any means to enforce it.\n\nWith a modern visitor management solution, businesses can easily configure\ntheir systems to cater not only to their staff and clients but also to third-\nparty contractors. Authorized personnel is provided access to vital details\nwithin the system to ensure that all contractors are compliant with the\norganization\u2019s process to ensure greater physical security.\n\n## Greetly Integrates with Tools You Already Use\n\n\n\n### Who uses Greetly?\n\nDue to our ease of use and mass customization, Greetly is beloved by work\nenvironments across industries.
