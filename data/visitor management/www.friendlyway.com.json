Visitor sign-in,\nregistration, or check-in is only a small part of the overall process.\n\nOther elements include visitor safety, security, arrival notifications,\ntracking, and acceptance of compliance regulations \u2013 all of which are unique\nto an organization\u2019s specific facility/building, industry, and visitor\nscenarios.\n\n## How Digital Visitor Management Systems Work\n\n## What Are Visitor Management Systems?\n\nVisitor management systems (VMS) allow organizations to efficiently welcome,\nkeep track of, and manage the visitors of a building, facility, office, place\nof business, or other location. There are three general categories of systems:\non-prem, cloud-based, and manual.\n\n **Make an outstanding first impression \u2014 every day**  \nDelight your guests, visitors, and employees with minimal wait times,\nintelligent access processes, and a high-quality appearance.\n\nView offer\n\n## Types of Visitor Management\n\nBelow is an overview of the two most common types of visitor management\nscenarios.\n\n### Guests & Visitors\n\nOffice buildings, hotels, transportation centers, and even big manufacturing\nfacilities all share one thing in common: they receive a large number of\nvisitors to their premises every year. Structuring an efficient guest\nmanagement process, and deploying the right tech stack, are crucial aspects of\ndelivering a positive brand and visitor experience.\n\nFor example, friendlyway undertook a visitor management transformation project\nfor a multinational manufacturing client in Europe. The company received\nthousands of visitors each year and desperately needed to streamline and\nmodernize their outdated paper-based visitor management system.\n\nBy migrating to our cloud-based software and kiosks, the company was able to\nmaximize operational efficiencies and streamline the check-in and check-out\nprocesses (all while remaining fully compliant with industry safety\nregulations and eliminating a tremendous amount of paper and resource waste).\n\nInstead of performing a manual check-in, needing to physically sign liability\npapers and interact with staff members, visitors can now complete nearly all\nof the check-in process at a self-service kiosk. Additionally, staff members\nno longer need to directly manage visitor check-ins or check-outs, leading to\nan increase in staff productivity. That is what visitor management is all\nabout \u2013 making the process easy for the visitor and valuable for the business.\n\n### Employees, Contractors, and Temporary Workers\n\nIt\u2019s possible to use a visitor management system for full-time employees,\ncontractors, and temporary workers as a way to consolidate staff registration,\ncheck-in, check-out, clock-in/clock-out, and access control processes.\n\nAdditionally, most modern cloud-based systems can be integrated with\ncompatible access control systems (e.g. in-building turnstile hardware),\nproviding organizations with a fully comprehensive software/hardware\nintegration.\n\nIn many cases, initial employee onboarding (e.g. badge or ID card creation,\nfilling out employment forms, etc.) can also be completed using the same\nvisitor management system via a self-service kiosk. Employees can print their\nID badge right at the kiosk, with the kiosk automatically syncing their data\ninto the access control system\u2019s database (for automated employee turnstile\naccess).\n\nBeing able to automate employee and temporary employee onboarding, building\nregistration, and check-in/check-out processes via integrated self-service\nkiosks can greatly enhance an organization\u2019s operational efficiencies.\n\nCase study\n\nMillennium Print Group (MPG), one of the largest producers of trading cards in\nthe US, uses a fully streamlined temp worker and visitor management system\nfrom friendlyway to efficiently register, check in, check out, and track the\nactivity of **over 1,200 persons daily** while ensuring service availability\n24/7.\n\nRead more\n\n## Typical Step-By-Step Process\n\nfriendlyway Cloud Platform offers an intuitive, quick, and user-friendly\nprocess for creating, editing, and managing events, adding visitors, editing\nvisitor lists, and overseeing the entire visitor management process. Here\u2019s\nhow it works:\n\n### 1\\. Planning events and adding visitors\n\nUsers can create, schedule, and manage events via friendlyway Cloud Platform.\nBuilding visitor lists for specific events is intuitive, fast, and simple \u2013\nvisitors can be added directly on the platform or in bulk by uploading an\nexcel file.\n\nAfter visitors have been uploaded or added on the platform, the system\nautomatically generates unique visitor IDs for each person and updates the\nevent\u2019s main visitor list. The platform can also be used to automatically\nattach visitor photos to corresponding names on the list (for ID badge\ncreation).\n\n### 2\\. Visitor, event, and invitation management\n\nAfter an event has been created and visitors added to the event list, users\nhave access to several visitor list and event management functionalities\nincluding the ability to remove specific visitors from a list, cancel or\nreschedule events, update lists with additional visitors, and upload visitor\nphotos.\n\nIf an event needs to be canceled or rescheduled, or certain visitors need to\nbe added/removed from an event, the platform makes it incredibly easy and\nfast. Events can be deleted directly on the platform. Visitors can either be\ndeleted on the platform or via the event\u2019s excel list.\n\nEvent invitations can be custom designed, set up for multiple languages, and\nsent in bulk by email or text message. In the case of an event cancellation or\nrescheduling, the system automatically sends an event cancellation email or\ntext message out to the event\u2019s visitor list. Email invitations can be sent\nwith Microsoft Outlook through a downloadable plugin.\n\n### 3\\. In-person and online visitor check-in\n\nVisitors initiate the check-in process by presenting a valid ID at the check-\nin kiosk. If the visitor is not on the list they will be denied access.\n\n### 4\\. Visitors\u2019 COVID questionnaire, compliance, and document signing\n\nAgreement forms, compliance documents, COVID questionnaires, and other\ndocuments can be added to the check-in process for visitors to sign prior to\ncompleting the check-in process and receiving their access cards/ID badges.\n\nNote: The entire check-in process is fully customizable via the \u201csettings\u201d\nsection on the friendlyway platform. Steps can be added, removed, or\ncustomized according to event-specific needs. Custom forms, documents, and\nquestionnaires can easily be created or uploaded and added to the check-in\nprocess on the cloud platform.\n\n### 5\\. Badge printing or access card disbursement, or provision of access via\nmobile app\n\nVisitors who are on the event list will be able to print an ID badge directly\nat the kiosk.  \nIf a visitor arrives early for their event, they can \u201cpre-register\u201d (if the\noption is activated) and still receive an ID badge. Visitors who are late to\nan event can still check-in and receive their badge.\n\n### 6\\. Physical access to building/designated areas using access badge/card\n\nAfter completing the check-in process at the self-service kiosk/terminal and\nreceiving their ID badge or access card, visitors can enter the building/event\nby swiping or scanning their printed badges at entrance/exit turnstiles in the\nbuilding.\n\nIf the visitor is checked-in for any of the day\u2019s events they will be granted\naccess at the turnstile. If there is no record of the visitor being checked-in\nfor the events, they will be denied access to the building/event location.\n\n### 7\\. Managing, supervising, and tracking visitor activity\n\nUsers can track visitor activity (e.g. check-ins, check-outs, etc.) directly\non the cloud platform under the \u201cVisit Log\u201d section. Detailed check-in\ninformation, questionnaire answers, signed documents, etc., can all be viewed\nonline in real-time.\n\n### 8\\. Visitor check-out\n\nWhen an event has ended, or it\u2019s time for a visitor to leave for the day,\ntheir ID card/badge can be swiped at the building\u2019s turnstiles upon leaving.\nIf the visitor was registered/checked-in for the event, the system will\nautomatically check them out. If there is no record of the visitor checking-\nin, they will be denied exit access.\n\n### 9\\. Post-event emails and notifications\n\nAfter an event has finished, or a visitor has checked out, users have the\noption to send follow-up emails. For example, asking a client to leave\nfeedback, sign additional forms or documents, or share links to additional\ncontent.\n\n### 10\\. Reporting\n\nThe platform features numerous reporting capabilities such as detailed visitor\ninformation (e.g. visitor check-in and check-out times), which areas of the\nfacility/building were visited, when certain areas were accessed, etc.\nAdditionally, custom reports can be made based on the content that was\ndisplayed to visitors (such as questionnaires and interactive forms).\n\n **Professionally manage all phases of the visitor journey**  \nElevate your visitor management with friendlyway\u2019s top-notch, smart solution.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Solution Components\n\n### Software: Powered by the Cloud\n\nCloud-based software serves as the backbone of any modern visitor management\nsystem. friendlyway Cloud Platform provides organizations with the ability to\ncreate, edit, manage, and display a wide variety of content and experience\ntypes \u2013 created, edited, and managed remotely via the internet.\n\nThe creation and publishing of visitor management-related content, services,\nand processes is completed via friendlyway Cloud Platform, which are then sent\nto and displayed on the kiosk screen for visitors to interact with.\n\n### Hardware: Touchscreen Kiosks, Displays, and Terminals\n\nOur self-service kiosks and touch display hardware are fully integrated with\nour cloud-based software solutions, and also feature integrations with\nnumerous other types of hardware, including barcode scanners, printers, ID\ncard/badge printers, cameras, microphones, and sensors.\n\nfriendlyway Cloud Platform automatically syncs to a locally-installed agent\nrunning on each kiosk. The agent downloads the content from the cloud, after\nwhich it is displayed on the kiosk (available for end-user interaction).\nImagine being able to simultaneously update all of the kiosks or displays in a\nbuilding with custom content from a singular platform over the internet.\nThat\u2019s the power of cloud-based visitor management, and the power of\nfriendlyway.\n\n## Benefits of Contactless Visitor Management\n\n### Automated, streamlined, and quicker visitor check-ins\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of implementing a self-service visitor\nmanagement system is that check-in, check-out, and visitor registration\nprocesses automatically become a lot more streamlined and efficient. Self-\nservice kiosks minimize the need for additional front desk, security, and\nsupport staff members, which translates to lower operational costs.\n\nBy allowing visitors to check in via self-service contactless kiosks, front\ndesk and admin staff no longer need to be bogged down by visitor management\nduties. The automated system seamlessly logs visitor data, grants the\nappropriate privileges, prints ID badges, and welcomes the guest into the\nbuilding.\n\n### Fully customizable according to building-specific needs\n\nCutting-edge visitor management systems, such as friendlyway\u2019s cloud-based\noffering, are fully customizable according to the specific needs of an\norganization. With one of the largest feature sets in the industry, our cloud-\nbased platform empowers companies to deliver smooth, quick, and interactive\nvisitor experiences to guests, staff, and non-employees alike.\n\n### Multi-language support\n\nUsing a VMS with multi-language support completely eliminates the potential\nfor language-based miscommunications. For example, friendlyway Cloud Platform\nsupports numerous common languages, meaning that whoever is visiting your\nbuilding (and no matter what language they speak), they will receive the same\ngold standard visitor experience as everyone else.\n\n## GDPR and Visitor Management\n\nCompanies found to be non-compliant with globally recognized data standards\n(such as GDPR) can potentially face fines of up to 10 million euros, or 2% of\ntheir annual revenue. And that\u2019s for non-compliance considered to be \u201clow-\nlevel.\u201d\n\nOne of the major benefits of utilizing a modern visitor management system is\nthat it can greatly assist in the management (and automation) of ensuring\nproper data and privacy compliance. GDPR has a direct application to visitor\nmanagement scenarios, which is why it\u2019s essential to make sure that your\norganization is compliant with GDPR best practices.\n\nUsing a cloud-based visitor management system can greatly minimize an\norganization\u2019s effort in becoming and/or remaining compliant, compared to\ntraditional/manual visitor management processes (which are prone to human\nerror and general inefficiency).\n\n## Why Contactless Visitor Registration and Self-Service Is Growing In the\nPost-COVID Economy\n\nThe push towards self-service tech and contactless services was occurring long\nbefore the pandemic, but COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation across\nnearly all industries \u2013 which in turn caused a dramatic rise in the adoption\nof contactless and self-service technologies.\n\nThe pandemic pushed customers to become more digitally savvy, CX expectations\nevolved at a rapid pace, and organizations needed a way to meet this newfound\ndemand for quick, seamless, contactless experiences. Per Deloitte, the\ncontactless economy is on track to become a multi-trillion dollar market, with\nself-service solutions playing a crucial role in the market\u2019s global growth.\n\n## Who Can Use a Visitor Management System?\n\nVisitor management systems can be used for a wide range of scenarios across\nnumerous industries. From hotels, transportation centers, and government\nbuildings, to offices and industrial facilities \u2013 if your organization\noperates a building or location that receives visitors, implementing a modern\nvisitor management system is highly recommended.\n\n_A visitor management system and self-service kiosks at work in the hotel\nindustry_\n\nApart from checking in visitors or registering guests, many companies also use\nvisitor management software and kiosks for employee-related management. For\nexample, organizations can use a self-service kiosk for employee or contractor\nonboarding, building access registration, and staff check-in/check-out\npurposes.\n\n## How Digital Visitor Management Can Help\n\nDigital visitor management can help businesses streamline and automate the way\nthey interact with, manage, and engage with visitors and guests. With the\nexplosive increase in digital transformation spending post-pandemic, it\u2019s\nimportant to be able to deliver engaging, digital experiences to visitors,\nguests, customers, and workers alike \u2013 digital visitor management systems can\neffectively transform an organization\u2019s visitor experience.\n\nGlobal spending on technology that enables digital transformation is expected\nto exceed $2 trillion by 2023. System and platform modernization, including\nvisitor management, will continue to play a role in global DX investments\nacross all industries.\n\n## Features of an Integrated Visitor Management System\n\nThe term \u201cintegrated visitor management system\u201d commonly refers to visitor\nmanagement systems that are integrated with an organization\u2019s access control\nsystem. By using an integrated system, organizations can exhibit more control\nover visitors and guests (from a security perspective) by granting them\nappropriate access privileges to secure areas, notifying security staff of\ntheir arrival, tracking visitor activity, etc. Other typical features of this\nsystem type include:\n\n  * Integration with mobile technology (e.g. granting a visitor temporary access privileges via their smartphone)\n  * Remotely unlock doors, communicate with guests, and send notifications\n  * Security data logs, reporting, and analytics on visitor activity\n  * Ability to grant temporary security privileges for guests\n  * Integration with building security and access control systems.\n\n **More security and compliance**  \nA professional visitor management solution optimizes your company\u2019s legal and\noperational security.\n\nARRANGE APPOINTMENT\n\n## Business Benefits of Visitor Management\n\nImplementing a modern visitor management system can directly translate to\nimproved staff productivity, lower operational costs, insightful visitor data,\nand streamlined check-in/check-out processes. Some of the other major benefits\nof visitor management for business include the following.\n\n### Increased compliance\n\nData regulations like GDPR have transformed the expectations of how businesses\ncollect, process, and store data. Digitized visitor management systems allow\nbusinesses to become (and stay compliant) with new data regulations.\n\n### Better security\n\nUsing a visitor management system allows organizations to know exactly who is\nplanning on coming to their building, who has already checked in, as well as\nwhere exactly visitors are (and what they\u2019re doing) within the building.\nHaving a more informed view of visitor activity means having a more secure\nbuilding, especially if the system is integrated with a building\u2019s access\ncontrol solution.\n\n### Potential for lowered costs\n\nSelf-service kiosks with registration, check-in, badge printing, and other\nfeatures can greatly streamline the visitor management process. Streamlined\nworkflows and a decreased need for human oversight can lead to lower\noperational costs and higher productivity from staff.\n\n## friendlyway Solutions: Software and Hardware\n\n### Software\n\nfriendlyway Cloud Platform is where content, modules, and screen flows are\ncreated, edited, managed, scheduled, and deployed to display hardware.\n\nIn addition, the cloud platform can be used to manage connected hardware and\ndevices, view reports and analytics, as well as perform user and role\nmanagement/administration.
