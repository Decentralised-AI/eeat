We have\nanswers.\n\n **What is visitor management?**\n\nVisitor management is a set of processes used to keep track of anyone visiting\nan organization\u2019s offices or workspaces.  \n  \nSome companies simply keep a record of the names of visitors, while others\nhave additional requirements for security and office safety, like printing\nbadges, filling out paperwork, submitting health assessments, and so on. For\ncompanies that wish to maintain higher degrees of security and provide a more\nmodern visitor experience, they will typically use a software-based visitor\nmanagement system.\n\n **How do you manage office visitors?**\n\nHow to manage office visitors depends on a number of variables, including the\nextent to which you host visitors and the desire or need for a high degree of\nsecurity. The easiest way to manage office visitors is by choosing a visitor\nmanagement system that allows you to set up policies for office visitors,\ntrack who is coming and going, and make visitor check-in more modern and\nseamless.  \n  \nUsing a dedicated visitor management system also allows you to customize your\nprocesses across offices, helping ensure all visitors have a consistent,\npositive experience, as well as reducing risk to the company through enhanced\ndata protocols and potentially even required execution of legal documents such\nas non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).\n\n**What is visitor management software?**\n\nVisitor management software streamlines the process of keeping track of who\nenters and leaves a company\u2019s office, while enhancing both data security and\nvisitor experience.  \n  \nBy using visitor management software, companies can improve data security by\nreplacing a pad of names with online check-in, enhance the on-site experience\nfor visitors through streamlined processes and branded name badges, protect\nsensitive company information through the required execution of a non-\ndisclosure agreement (NDA), and even ensure greater security for employees\nwith features such as visitor block lists.  \n\n **How does using a visitor management system make a difference in the hybrid\nworkplace?**\n\nUsing a visitor management system makes the hybrid workplace experience better\nfor employees, admins, and guests.  \n  \nVisitor management systems save time for both visitors and for your company.\nWith visitor management software in place, visitors move through the check-in\nprocess more efficiently, with just a few check-in prompts on a tablet when\nthey arrive.
