There are different methods for visitor\nscreening, from I.D. badges to electronic registration.  \n\nWhat is visitor management software?\n\nVisitor management software is a way to digitize how organizations manage and\ntrack visitors. Different components can include:\n\n  * I.D. Scanning \n\n  * Electronic logbooks \n\n  * Facial recognition technology \n\n  * Mobile-card readers\n\nHow does a visitor management system work?\n\nA visitor management system is a cloud-based solution that integrates a\nvariety of hardware for you to plan and manage the visitor experience.  \n\nVisitor management can begin even before a person enters the building. Your\ncan enter planned visits into an electronic logbook and send customized access\ninformation to guests.\n\nOnce a person arrives, they can check-in at a self-serve kiosk where they can\nbe asked to complete a screening questionnaire, or they can be welcomed at\nreception where their ID is scanned, and a visitor pass issued. You can also\nintegrate the solution into your access control system to grant temporary\naccess to parts of your facility.  \n\nA visitor management system also helps you keep track of who is in your\nfacility, while also helping you keep sensitive information secure. You\u2019ll\nhave analytics on who\u2019s visiting and visitor volumes, and gain insight into\ntrends and patterns.\n\nWhy is visitor management important?\n\nCreating an environment where your customers and employees feel safe and\nsecure is extremely important. Visitor Management is the process of keeping\ntrack of who is on-site so that everyone can feel more confident that visitors\nhave been consistently processed and screened to ensure compliance and\nincreased safety.\n\nCan I integrate a visitor management solution with my existing security\nsystem?\n\nYes, our visitor management solution can integrate with your existing access\ncontrol and identity systems, including human resources, email and calendar,\nmass notification and guest Wi-Fi management systems. You will benefit from\navoiding costly rip and replace activities to extend the usability of your\ncurrent technologies. An access control system that integrates with a visitor\nmanagement system can be a powerful combination to help you give or take away\naccess for a visitor, to ultimately keep areas of the facility secure.\n\nHow do you manage visitors?\n\nYour approach to visitor management starts with defining your goals. Are you\ntying to facilitate timed meetings or events? Do you need to screen for\nsecurity and health? Is it important to create highly personalized and\ncustomized experiences? What is your need for insight and analytics into the\nvisitor experience?\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, you can create visitor management\nprocedures and implement the right visitor management technology tailored to\nyour organization. For example, to assess the health of new entrants, you can\nhave health questionnaires or a temperature screening system. If you want to\ndeploy touchless screening systems, set up mobile card readers to scan I.D.s.\n\nWhy is an automated visitor management system better than a manual one?\n\nThe biggest advantage of automating visitor management is that it accurately\nidentifies and tracks visitors, keeping your building secure and your\nemployees safe. An automated system drives operational efficiencies by\nreducing administrative costs including any costs associated with a potential\nsecurity breach, along with saving time. An automated software allows you to\nidentify anyone who is in your building at any time and to help ensure\ncompliance. Additionally, you have access to data to analyze and understand\nvisitor patterns or be able to search history. Having visitor management\nautomated allows visitors as they enter your lobby a more pleasant on-site\nexperience along with a seamless pre-registration experience.\n\nWhat to look for in a visitor management system?\n\nWhen you\u2019re choosing a visitor management system, confirm that it will\naccomplish\u2014and hopefully exceed\u2014your security and monitoring goals.  \n\nGo beyond standalone systems\u2014your system should be easy to integrate with your\nother security platforms, such as fire detection and access control.\nScalability is also essential. You\u2019ll want your system to support your\norganization\u2019s evolving needs, including expanding to other sites.  \n\nWhat are visitor management techniques?\n\nSecurity is just one aspect of successful visitor management. Fundamentally,\nvisitor management is about creating the right experience for your visitors\nand empowering your staff to deliver great experiences time after time. Map\nout your desired visitor touchpoints and then determine how they will happen.\n\nFor example, you may want a visitor kiosk where people can fill out pre-\nregistration forms. The system can notify employees who are expecting a\nvisitor when they arrive. You can also verify if the visitor is approved to\ncome in by checking it against a prohibited visitors list.  \n\nCloud and mobile devices can help to streamline the identification process.\nAlso decide if you want screening technology to identify people through face\nmasks or check their temperature.  \n\nTurn to your visitor management technology to enable automation and digitize\nmanual processes for accuracy and efficiency. Your goal? A positive, safe, and\ninviting visitor experience.  \n\nRelated Solutions\n\n##  Frequently Bundled With\n\nExplore Solutions\n\n###  Video Surveillance\n\nKeep an eye on your business from anywhere, any time with Securitas\nTechnology, one of the top verified video surveillance companies.\n\nLearn more\n\n###  Professional Integrated Security Services\n\nFrom security system integration to security risk assessments, Securitas\nTechnology offers a wide range of professional and managed services.\n\nLearn more\n\n###  Workplace Management Solutions\n\nIntegrate workplace management into your existing security for a safer,\nhealthier and more flexible environment.\n\nLearn more\n\nPrevious Next\n\nPrevious Next\n\n##  Get Started With Visitor Management Today\n\nGet in Touch\n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Our Brands\n  * Locations\n  * News\n  * Careers\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Knowledge Center\n  * Blog\n  * Pay My Bill\n\n## Policies\n\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Licenses\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n## Get Connected\n\nStay up-to-date on Securitas Technology insights, news and events.\n\n*\n\nEmail:\n\nBy submitting your information, you agree to receiving communications from\nSecuritas Technology and to our use of your data in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nGet Instant Access\n\n  * view our facebook page \n  * view our twitter page \n  * view our linkedin page \n  * view our youtube channel \n\n\u00a9 2023 Securitas Technology\n\nThis website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze\nperformance and traffic on our website.
