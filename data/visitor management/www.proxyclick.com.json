The basics of visitor management\n\n###  \n\n## 1.1  What is visitor management?\n\n**Visitor management**is the act of tracking the people who come and go from\nyour premises.\n\nWhether or not your company has receptionists or even a front desk in place,\nyou should consider visitor management a golden opportunity to raise your\nbrand awareness.\n\n**For** **example** : If your organization is known for outstanding customer\nservice and innovation, then the last thing your visitor would expect is to\nsign in on a piece of paper in your lobby.\n\nIt's less about \"managing\" visitors and more about having them walk away with\na good impression of your business. People management: because business\nmeetings are people meetings.\n\nIt's a chance for you to align the way you welcome visitors into your\nbuilding, with your company values.  \n\n## 1.2 What are the different types of visitors?\n\nOn any given business day, your visitors can be categorized but not limited\nto:\n\n  * Business meeting attendees\n  * Candidates for job interviews\n  * Messengers or delivery people\n  * Contractors or vendors\n  * Auditors or regulatory professionals\n  * Unexpected drop-ins\n\nDuring the global health crisis, the safest policy to adopt may be one in\nwhich everyone is a visitor.\n\nThis includes not only the categories of individuals mentioned above but also\nregular employees - particularly given that the same people may not be showing\nup at the office every day due to work-from-home and hybrid work situations.\n\nIn order to maintain safe social distancing, align with healthcare experts\u2019\nrecommended best practices, and make sure everyone has a place to work, many\ncompanies are finding it useful to view their own employees as frequent\nvisitors - and make sure their presence on the premises is accounted for\naccordingly.\n\nRegardless, a company dictates what types of visitors are expected - and that\nwill vary tremendously based on their needs.\n\n## 1.3  What is a visitor management system (VMS)?\n\nIf you're reading this, then you've probably attended a meeting or two at\nsomeone else's place of business. Or maybe you've been job hunting recently,\nand have been in an out of your share of corporate lobbies.\n\nHopefully, you have fond memories of those visits\u2014how you were greeted, made\nto feel safe and welcomed during your stay, as a part of doing business.\n\nChances are, there was a system in place to make your experience for visitors\nsuch a positive one.  \n\nA **visitor management system  **represents all the processes and activities\nan organization puts in place to manage the flow of visitors, from start to\nfinish, as a part of the bigger picture\u2014the visitor experience.\n\n## 1.4  What is a visitor experience, exactly?\n\nThe term \"visitor experience\" is used most often in the business-to-consumer\n(B2C) world.\n\nIt refers to clients\u2019 experiences involving anything from a trip to the movie\ntheater, to purchasing a new couch in a furniture store, to signing up with a\nbank and opening a checking account - and encompasses all the customers\u2019\nfeelings and impressions about these events.\n\nBut in this era of digital transformation, it's more important than ever that\nthere's a human touch - a focus on individual visitor experience, and on\nsatisfying a client - in the B2B world.\n\n> Companies consist of people, and business-to-business settings also present\n> stages for experiences.\n\n\u2014 Pine & Gilmore in 'Welcome to the Experience Economy,' Harvard Business\nReview  \n\nThe Harvard Business Review published Welcome to the Experience Economy more\nthan 20 years ago, but the messages still ring true today. And they can be\napplied to your organization's visitor management.\n\nIt's high-time the visitor experience sees some changes, because \"the\nconventional approach\" isn't working anymore.\n\n### Example of a bad visitor experience:\n\nAn archaic visitor management system, aka the paper sign-in sheet, results in\na poor experience for our friendly visitor \"Steven\":\n\nIf only his hosts had chosen a better visitor management system than old-\nfashioned pen and paper!\n\nWould you believe us if we told you that Steven could have been saved from all\nhis pain and misery?\n\n**Download Steven's improved path so you can see how you can do better for\nyour visitors today.**\n\n## 1.5 Who uses visitor management systems?\n\nThere's a common misconception that \"visitor management systems are expensive\nand only for big companies.\"\n\nSize does not matter when it comes to visitor management. Organizations both\ngreat and small, to Fortune 500 and Fortune 50, can benefit from a solid\nvisitor management system.\n\nThere exist solid use cases already, both on global and local levels:\n\n  * **Lucozade Ribena Suntory (UK)**\n  * **Brooklyn Navy Yard (US)**\n  * **Westland District Council (NZ) **\n\nVisitor management systems are used across industries as well, from A to\nalmost-Z (until we get our first Proxyclick-using Zoo, maybe).\n\n  * Aerospace & Defense\n  * Air Freight & Logistics\n  * Automotive\n  * Biotechnology\n  * Chemicals\n  * Commercial Services & Supplies\n  * Communications Equipment\n  * Construction & Engineering\n  * Consumer Discretionary\n  * Consumer Goods & Staples\n  * Containers & Packaging\n  * Distributors\n  * Diversified Financial Services\n  * Diversified Telecommunication Services\n  * Education Services\n  * Electronic Equipment, Instruments & Components\n  * Food Products\n  * Gas Utilities\n  * Health Care Providers & Services\n  * Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure  \n\n  * Industrial Conglomerates\n  * Internet Software & Services\n  * Leisure Products\n  * Machinery\n  * Media & Creative\n  * Metals & Mining\n  * Paper & Forest Products\n  * Pharmaceuticals\n  * Professional Services\n  * Real Estate\n  * Renewable Electricity\n  * Retail\n  * Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals\n  * Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods\n  * Transportation\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more essential industries have been\nturning to visitor management systems to help them adapt safely to the\nchallenges of keeping their workforce safe while continuing to deliver\nproducts and services that are, in some cases, even more in demand.\n\nThese include manufacturing companies, data centers, pharmaceutical companies,\nfood production and packaging, chemical companies, and logistics companies.\n\nFor all of these industries, visitor management systems have been instrumental\nin helping them to return their employees to work with a higher level of\nsafety, facilitating services such as:\n\n  * Health screening questions \n  * Safety guidelines sent in advance of entry\n  * Touchless check-in and overall smoother entry systems\n  * Accurate logs and reports of every individual to set foot on the premises\n  * Enabling fewer in-person interactions\n  * Easier space allocation on the premises\n  * Compliance with industry regulations on data security\n  * Easy adaptation (avoiding undue burdens for already thinly stretched IT teams)\n\nWe know that there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to choose a\nvisitor management provider that can scale\u2014up or down\u2014with your company.\n\n##  2\\. Types of visitor management systems\n\nInternet technology has progressed by leaps and bounds within the first two\ndecades of the 21st century, at a faster rate than over the previous 50 years.\n\nThough the role of the receptionist has evolved dramatically from the outdated\narchetypes depicted in television shows like AMC's Mad Men, some companies\npersist in utilizing pen and paper as a default visitor management system.\n\n## Dreaded pen and paper\n\n## On-premise software\n\n## Cloud-based software\n\n## 2.1  Pen and paper visitor management system\n\nThe infamous paper logbook\u2014what seems like an innocent enough and low-cost VMS\ncan cost you more in the long run.\n\nYou'll be able to record basic information about your visitors and hope that\nthey've given their real names and such. But that's if you can read their\nhandwriting in the first place.\n\nBut from an efficiency and security standpoint, you're asking for trouble if\nyou depend on the paper logbook.\n\nNot only do visitor sign-in sheets cause long lines at reception, but they\nalso violate your visitors' privacy because their information is left there in\nplain sight for the next person to see.\n\nThe easy visibility and availability of visitors\u2019 information are one of the\nmany problems with the paper logbook system, in that it\u2019s all too easy for\nsomeone with ill intent to capture that data (say, by taking a screenshot on a\nphone when no one is looking.)\n\nBut, data privacy and security issues are not the only downside of the paper\nlogbook; there\u2019s also the fundamental inability to use that data productively,\nas far as keeping workers safe or ensuring a smooth visitor experience (as\nyou\u2019ll learn more about later in this guide.)\n\n## 2.2  On-premise software\n\nFriends shouldn't let friends use old legacy software for their visitor\nmanagement either.\n\nGranted, moving away from the paper trail and onto the electronic logbook is a\nstep in the right direction. But do you really want to deal with the amortized\ncosts of legacy systems?\n\nWith on-site software options, you'll run into a number of obstacles:\n\n  * **High acquisition costs**  involving the installation of server-side hardware, storage or anti-virus, or patch application (this includes any hidden costs of a self-hosted solution)...\n  * The need to make  _space_  (i.e., a server room/closet) for it, or power it or cool it.\n  * Buying hardware maintenance plans, software support, and future software version upgrades. \n\n> Why refresh servers and burden your balance sheet when you can get them as a\n> service?\n\n\u2014 Jacek Materna in 'On-Premise Is Dead, Long Live On-Premise,' Forbes  \n\nForbes Technology Council member Jacek Materna is absolutely right.\n\nBesides\u2014knock on wood\u2014in the event of emergency or evacuation, that\n\"electronic sign in sheet\" stored on a hard drive inside your office isn't\ngoing to be nearly as much help to you as a cloud-based visitor management\nsystem. (More on that in a moment.)\n\n## 2.3  Cloud-based visitor management solution\n\nThe interface is connected to **the cloud** where the information the visitors\nenter is gathered and then presented - on the other side of the front desk -\nin a dashboard for easy management.\n\nMoreover, a cloud-based system integrates with other platforms, to avoid a\ncomplicated overhaul of existing architecture (and a slew of common problems\nwith the adoption of new technology).\n\nOnly a cloud-based SaaS solution can provide you a best-of-breed approach so\nyou have more control over what you're using and what you're paying for.\n\nYou don't even have to take our word for it.\n\n  * There are scholarly white papers dedicated to the virtues of moving to the cloud.\n  * According to Forbes, a subscription to software as a service (SaaS) makes the most business sense.\n  * Cisco even predicts that \"By 2021, 94% of all workloads and compute instances will be processed in the cloud.\"\n\nThis movement also holds true for that of the cloud-based visitor management\nsystem.\n\nYour visitor management system should be able to make your life easier in a\nnumber of ways. And let's face it, the cloud doesn't sleep or take bathroom\nbreaks. It doesn't need cooling or storing in some server room in your\nbuilding. Nowadays, you can try cloud applications for free before you ever\nput any money _down._\n\n##  3\\. Reasons to consider a visitor management system\n\nWe've got four really good and timely reasons right of the top of our heads to\nshare with you.\n\nThey're actually statistics pulled from 2,000 working professionals who were\npolled in the Front Desk Experience Survey 2018.\n\nAnd they only scratch the surface of what office workers across the US and the\nUK had to say about their experiences in corporate lobbies. (Download the\nreport)\n\nBut they do provide some compelling reasons to consider a visitor management\nsystem:\n\nEven in this era of video conferencing and live webinars, there is no end to\nlive face-to-face business meetings in sight.\n\nThis goes for both the US and the UK.\n\n> You will never see eye-to-eye if you never meet face-to-face.\n\n\u2014 Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  \n\nAccording to numbers reported in Meetings in America: A study of trends,\ncosts, and attitudes..., there are an estimated 11 million face-to-face\nbusiness meetings happening across the US every day.\n\nAt first, the number sounds unbelievable, but when you consider the population\nof America runs upwards of 320 million then it makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, a 2016 survey commissioned by that Centre for Economics and\nBusiness Research reports that face-to-face business meetings account for\n\u00a3193Bn of the UK economy.\n\nIn addition, London-based companies especially are primed to gain\napproximately \u00a3250K in new business simply by holding in-person business\nmeetings.\n\nSo why wouldn't you (and your organization) take visitor management seriously?\nLet's take a closer look at the aforementioned four reasons.\n\n## 3.1 Impress your visitors\n\nWith **48% of US respondents** admitting to having bad experiences in\ncorporate lobbies, we can deduce that these were bad first impressions made\noff the bat.\n\nWe even took a deeper look at the 8 main reasons cited for the poor visitor\nexperiences in the reception area:\n\nDownload the rest of the results from our 2018 Front Desk Experience Survey\n\nIt's such a shame because most bad experiences in corporate lobbies can be\navoided with the right amount of preparation and automation.\n\nEach of the complaints in the graphic above should be viewed, instead, as a\nchance to implement best practices - and that can be accomplished by utilizing\nthe right visitor management system.\n\n( **Pro tip:** never underestimate the power of an invitation email in setting\nthe tone and professionalism from day one.)\n\nCan you see the potential for best practices in each of the complaints above?\nEvery one of them could be remedied by the right visitor management system.\n\n## 3.2 Streamline procedures at reception\n\nBusiness meetings are people meetings, and in-person meetings are not going\nanywhere. So why are \"long lines at reception\" to blame 60% of the time?\n\nThe 2018 Front Desk Experience Survey also revealed three other obstacles.\n\nIndependent of other research, Joseph Allen, at the University of Nebraska\nOmaha, surveyed professionals across a variety of industries in the US: sales,\nretail, media, construction, IT, etc.\n\nAllen and his team asked these volunteers about the last meeting they'd\nattended, and his team published their findings in \"Let's get this meeting\nstarted: Meeting lateness and actual meeting outcomes.\"\n\nIn it, they reveal that 40\u201350% of the meetings started late. Period.\n\nThat margin of lateness borders on destruction, and certainly indicates wastes\nof time that a visitor management system could have salvaged.\n\n## 3.3 Secure your building\n\nWe get it. There's a fine line between keeping your office building secure and\nmaking your visitors uncomfortable.\n\nBut there's no need to make 85% of your visitors feel weird about the level of\npersonal data you're asking of them.\n\nDid you know that you can only collect data for required security protocol or\nto fulfill a business contract?\n\nData privacy laws, like GDPR, require something called **data**\n**minimization**.\n\n> Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in\n> relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\n\n\u2014 GDPR, Article 5, 1(c)  \n\nThis should be engrained in the way you do business and a part of your GDPR\ncompliance checklist.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nYou have to consider the real risks and imminent threats that start at your\nfront desk.\n\nWhen it comes to the physical security of your workplace, workforce, and\nintellectual property, your visitor management system can serve as your first\nline of defense.\n\nFor example: Maintaining high levels of security can be made easier with\naccess and integrations with global watchlists and facial recognition\ncapabilities for verifying ID documentation.\n\nProxyclick visitor management system with ID Match (ID Scan)\n\nNobody likes to have features thrown in their face when searching for digital\nsolutions on the internet. However, being tasked with finding the perfect\nvisitor management system for your business means you've got to be thorough.\n\nDoes the solution you're looking for check off all the boxes on your list of\nitems for security protocol?\n\n## 3.4 Stay in compliance\n\nIf somewhere between 62% and 70% of your visitors are admitting to sneaking\npeeks at other people's personal information in the guest registry, then\nthat's a huge red flag you can't ignore.\n\nAnd according to the survey results, the percentage of confessions to\n\"snooping\" was higher for US respondents: 70% to be exact.\n\n### Compliance audits around data privacy\n\nWhen it comes to regulatory compliance audits, your visitor management system\nwill\u2014by default\u2014 be the first thing the auditor will \"see.\"\n\nNow, it is possible to procure \"discreet sheets\" that use blackened bars for\ncarbon copy records\u2014for confidential sign-ins\u2014but still begs the question of\ndata retention and GDPR's Article 7(3).\n\nIf you haven't yet been able to wrap your head around all the business\nrequirements around visitor management data and GDPR, then no worries.\n\nWe recommend you start with \"The simple guide to GDPR and visitor management\"\nand go from there.\n\nIncidentally, the majority of respondents to the 2018 Front Desk Experience\nSurvey voiced their willingness to check in using iPads over the old pen and\npaper system.\n\nEveryone's well on their way to a digital future across generations. People,\nyoung and old, have been checking in via cloud-based visitor management\nsoftware for years now.\n\nIsn't time to join the movement before you're left behind with paper cuts?\n\n\n\n## 3.5 Supporting workplace safety during a pandemic\n\nPrior to the pandemic, many companies already were relying on visitor\nmanagement systems to allow them to be prepared for a health or safety crisis\n- be it severe flu outbreak, a heightened security risk of terrorist activity,\nor other types of unprecedented events.\n\nSolutions that have already been in place, such as:\n\n  * mandatory health screenings (delivered via digital questionnaires),\n  * infrared temperature checks,\n  * QR code-enabled badges with important visitor identification information, and,\n  * robust email or text notification systems\n\nThese have all helped businesses to continue operating safely in situations\nthat might otherwise put their visitors or employees at risk.\n\nNow, these same solutions have become integral parts of both business\ncontinuity planning and day-to-day operation during the pandemic: Cloud-based\nfront desk solutions, for instance, remove risks caused by in-person\ninteractions at visitor check-in, as well as creating better, more secure logs\nof visitor information.\n\nSystems for visitor access control help ensure that employees, visitors, and\ncontractors are able to get quickly and safely to their destinations.\n\nThese solutions also help everyone to remain touch-free (not to mention\nproviding a valuable security check so that strangers are not wandering in\nunauthorized areas, which was the basis of their popularity prior to the\npandemic.)\n\n##  4\\. How to choose the best visitor management solution\n\nIf you've made it to this part of the guide, then it means you're ready to\nstart the research phase into the things to look for when choosing a visitor\nmanagement system.\n\nSo, it's always a good idea to start with a little homework and determine how\nto align your needs with your visitors' needs.\n\n## 4.1 Think about your visitors\n\nReally, take a minute and give this some thought.\n\nIt's the seamless visitor experience that matters. The way your business is\nperceived is directly correlated to the way your visitors are welcomed.\n\nConsider this an opportunity to see your visitors in a new way by \"re-thinking\nyour reception area.\"\n\nTo get you started, we asked international corporate hospitality experts for\ntheir **10 key recommendations** :\n\n  1. Define your DNA and build loyalty\u2026 \n  2. Hire the right people from the right places.\n  3. Create (or recreate) visitor journeys.\n  4. Let your visitors help you find solutions that work.\n  5. Extend your definition of \u201cvisitor.\"\n  6. Recognize that technology, while essential, will never replace the human touch.\n  7. Consult a specialist.\n  8. Remember that money matters but in the end, people matter more. \n  9. Communicate effectively.\n  10. Never leave any opportunity untested or untried.\n\nGreat list, isn't it? Would you like to know more?\n\nWell, you can download all the best practices and actionable steps to step up\nyour reception area before you take a minute to assess the kinds of visitors\nyou receive on a regular basis.\n\n### Some questions to ask yourself\n\nIf you haven't already, then check out the list of different types of\nvisitors, in Section 1.2 of this guide, before answering the following\nquestions:\n\n  * Do you get many messengers or suppliers stopping in on their delivery rounds? \n  * Do you have any heavy recruiting and interviewing seasons coming up? \n  * Are your Board meetings scheduled in advance so that you can pre-register your visitors?\n  * Are most of your visitor's one-time guests, or do you have recurring visitors? \n  * What percentage of your visitors arrive unannounced? And would you like to manage the check-in process differently for such guests?\n\nDon't limit yourself to the questions listed above.\n\nBrainstorming with key members of your team is also recommended, especially\nwith those who will be benefiting most from a digital visitor management\nsolution.\n\n## 4.2 Assess your organizational needs\n\nWrite down as much as you can and as much you know about your visitors, past\nand present and future, and refer to it regularly while you conduct your\nresearch.  \n\nThen, ask yourself some questions around your business needs:\n\n  * Do you have multi-tenant needs or multiple locations to manage?\n  * Do you need your visitors to review safety instructions or to sign legal agreements (e.g. NDAs)? And do you need those documents stored?\n  * Are there complicated legal or compliance requirements you need to satisfy around screening or access control? And do they require your visitors to be checked against global watch lists? Or to wear visible visitor badges?\n  * Do you have specific steps in the visitor journey that you'd like automated? \n  * How would you like your visitors' hosts to be notified upon check-in?\n\nHaving as much information handy will not only help you to better assess your\nneeds, but it will also help you with the process of elimination\u2014that is,\nchoosing which visitor management systems make the cut (after reading their\nreviews on Google, G2 Crowd, or Capterra) before you give them a try.\n\n**Tip** : Any visitor management system worth a try will be able to offer you\na free trial with no strings attached (i.e. no credit card information\nrequired of you).\n\n\n\n## 4.3 Start a free trial\n\nTake the plunge and sign up.\n\nDon't feel comfortable providing your credit card information to get that free\ntrial started? We don't blame you. You shouldn't have to.\n\nFree trials should be just that, at no cost, and no obligation.\n\nThe best way to determine whether not the solution will fulfill your needs is\nto throw it right into the mix of your daily operations.\n\nIf you can, then have your reception team and a handful of colleagues test the\nsolution with you. Throw your own free trial party if you want to.\n\n### For reception\n\nHistorically, receptionists are blamed when \"visitors get stuck at reception.\"\n\nWith the right visitor management system to streamline procedures,\nreceptionists can return to providing that human touch.\n\n### For hosts\n\nUnderstandably, hosts want their guests to be relaxed and made to feel\nwelcome.\n\nDelays at check-in can lead to disastrous starts to business meetings. Timely\nnotifications and communication can alleviate such stress.\n\nSo take your time and see if the platform functions the way you need it to.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted something that's beautiful and intuitively\ndesigned. But the easier it is to use the better so there's minimal training\ninvolved.\n\n**Tip** : Don't be afraid to ask for an extension on your trial if you need a\nfew more days.\n\n## 4.4 Ask tough questions\n\nOnce you've taken your solution for a spin, and maybe even watched a demo,\nyou'll know better whether or not it's \"the one.\"\n\nThis is where you need to buckle down and get some answers for long-term\nuse\u2014before the \"honeymoon phase\" between you and your visitor management\nsystem fades. Figure out what's important to you and what your deal breakers\nare.\n\nThen ask your questions including, but not limited to:\n\n  * How long have you been in the visitor management business? \n  * Do you have references or testimonials from existing clients you can share with me?\n  * What types of security penetration tests have you passed? SOC 2 Type I and/or SOC 2 Type II?\n  * Can you help me comply with global regulations such as GDPR?\n  * What can you tell me about the whole other world outside of GDPR, as far as compliance objectives go?\n  * Can I leverage my existing tools and systems with integrations you have in place?\n  * How much does my IT department have to be involved?\n\nIt's important to get straight answers, but it's also a great way to gauge the\ncommunication style and level of transparency in the conversation.\n\nYou should feel supported and valued from day one, month after month and year\nover year.\n\n## 4.5 Get buy-in from internal stakeholders\n\nWhen it comes to delivering a VIP visitor experience, it truly is a team\neffort. As such, you'll need to recruit the help of members across various\ndepartments.\n\nWe've narrowed down 7 internal stakeholders you'll want to be involved:\n\n  * Security\n  * IT\n  * Reception\n  * Senior management\n  * Legal\n  * Marketing & HR\n  * Employees\n\nDo you how each stakeholder stands to benefit from adopting the visitor\nmanagement system you present?\n\nYou can dig a little deeper in our free ebook, \"Getting rid of the signing-in\nbook,\" and use it as a catalyst to get the conversation going.\n\n##  5\\.
