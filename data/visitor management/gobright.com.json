Use one or multiple screens in your reception area, depending on the\nnumber of visitors you welcome each day.\n\nVisitor Management Software  Visitor Management Hardware  Digital Signage\n\nGoBright Platform  Pre-registration  Self-registration  Custom design\n\nCertified Hardware Partners  Badge printing\n\nWarm welcome with Digital Signage  Wayfinding\n\n###  Unique booking and reception software for flexible workspaces\n\nThe GoBright Platform empowers employees to make bookings and registrations\nbased on their preferences, enhancing collaboration in flexible workspaces.\nYou can also gain valuable insights into office space utilisation.\n\n  * Online Portal\n  * Mobile App\n  * Microsoft Teams integration\n  * Outlook Plugin\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n###  Pre-register your guests\n\nWhen guests are pre-registered, they receive a QR-code in the invitation. The\nvisitor scans this QR-code upon arrival and all their details are stored in\nthe Online Portal. The host of the meeting automatically receives a text\nmessage or email notifying that the guest has arrived. The receptionist knows\nupfront who to expect, so they can print badges in advance.\n\n  * No unnecessary queues at the counter.\n  * Receptionist does not need to track down phone numbers or colleagues.\n  * Add directions, safety instructions or a health check to your invite.\n  * Completely paperless.\n\n###  Do your own checking-in\n\nVisitors enter the building without a pre-registration invite and register\nthemselves on the spot, by following the steps on the screen. They fill in the\nrequested information, such as name and email. They look up the name of the\nemployee they are visiting, accept any safety instructions and check in. The\nhost of the meeting automatically receives a text message or email saying the\nguest has arrived.\n\n###  Customise your digital reception\n\nCustomise the template of the **Visitor Management System\u2019s** registration\ndisplay and the email, according to your corporate identity.\n\n  * Add directions, safety instructions or a health check to your invite.\n  * Pre-set your preferred language\n  * Specify the information you need from your visitor.\n\n###  We partner with worldwide known manufacturers\n\nThe user experience of our software is even better when it is applied to high\nquality hardware.
