We\u2019ll cover:\n\nWhat Is a Visitor Management System?\n\nCommon Features of a Visitor Management System\n\nWhat Type of Buyer Are You?\n\nKey Considerations\n\nPricing and Purchasing Options\n\n## What Is a Visitor Management System?\n\nA VMS helps manage the flow of visitors into a company\u2019s facilities or other\nlocations. As visitors arrive, they can use a kiosk loaded with a VMS to self-\nregister for a meeting or event. Visitor identification, such as a photo ID or\nbusiness card, can also be scanned and checked against a watch list to\nincrease security. Additionally, administrative personnel can use the solution\nto manage assets, such as keys and access cards assigned to visitors. Each\nitem can be individually tagged to mitigate the risk of loss or theft.\n\n _A contractor uses a Sine VMS kiosk to check in for a meeting (Source:\nsine.co)_\n\nOnce the system clears a person for entry, they can print a customized name\ntag or visitor badge that will allow them access to any area the company\ndetermines.\n\nThe system can also notify an employee that their guest has arrived and offer\nthe guest directions to a meeting room or display a directory. In the case of\nemergency evacuations, security supervisors and floor wardens can sign people\nout of the building premises securely using an electronic verification\nprocess.\n\nOver time, visitor data can be collected for return visits and reporting\npurposes.\n\n## Common Features of a Visitor Management System\n\nFeatures vary among top VMS software platforms, but the following features are\nmost common:\n\n **Visitor screening**\n\n|\n\nA VMS screens visitors against local or online watch lists. Schools and day\ncares often use a VMS to prevent entry or alert security officials if a\nregistered sex offender attempts to enter.  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n **Preregistration**\n\n|\n\nVMS users can enable pre-registration, which emails guests ahead of their\nvisit. These emails can include dates, times, directions, parking information\nand other details that help visitors get to their meetings quickly.  \n  \n **Self check-in**\n\n|\n\nGuests can self-register by using a tablet kiosk or smartphone as they enter\nthe building. These visitor-facing interfaces can be customized with company\nlogos or special instructions.  \n  \n **ID scanning and badging**\n\n|\n\nInstead of entering information with a keypad, visitors can scan their\nbusiness card or other photo identification to check in. A VMS can instantly\nprint a name tag to give guests access to their intended destination in a\nbuilding.  \n  \n **Electronic documents**\n\n|\n\nA company can ask visitors to digitally sign documents when checking in, such\nas a non-disclosure agreement to protect sensitive corporate information.  \n  \n **Visitor tracking and reporting**\n\n|\n\nThe system can retain information about each person, such as arrival and\ndeparture time, duration of visit and more. This data is useful for\ndetermining the location of a visitor or generating reports on attendance, for\nexample.  \n  \n **Notifications**\n\n|\n\nAfter a visitor checks in, the system can notify the employee they are\nscheduled to meet with, so meetings can start on time.  \n  \n **Embedded database**\n\n|\n\nA VMS comes integrated with an embedded database where all data is stored\nlocally. This eliminates the need of any connections with third-party database\nsystems or setting up preregistration tools, as visitor information is stored\nby the system.  \n  \n## What Type of Buyer Are You?\n\nYour industry determines the features and extras that can be useful for your\norganization. A variety of industries may use a VMS to increase security and\nefficiency in their facilities, such as:\n\n **K-12 education.** Primary school VMS users can benefit from ID cards\ncustomized with the school\u2019s logo for faculty and name badges for students.\nThis helps increase transparency among students and faculty and prevent entry\nfor those who have no official business at the school.\n\n **University campus.** Campus security is a top priority. Using a VMS, higher\neducation campuses can maintain secure facilities with access control so that\nonly professors and administrators are allowed into sensitive areas.\n\n **Corporate and government.** Companies and government organizations can keep\ndata and hardware secure with access control, as well as improve the visitor\nexperience for nonemployees by providing directions and other information to\nhelp them reach their meetings on time.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\nA VMS often requires the use of extra hardware and other accessories so\nvisitors can check in, print name tags and gain access to buildings. These can\ninclude:\n\n **Kiosk computers.** A receptionist can greet visitors and use a VMS to check\nthem in. However, for companies or organizations with a high volume of guests,\nevents and meetings, setting up a kiosk for self check in can speed up the\ncheck-in process.\n\n **Printers.** Guests can be identified visually with customized name tags\nprinted on a specialized printer, located either behind the reception desk or\nnext to a self-service kiosk.\n\n **ID cards and keytags.** For frequent visitors, companies may decide to\nissue permanent plastic ID cards or keytags, which are small plastic tags\nguests can scan upon entry.\n\n _An ID badge printed using Proxyclick\u2019s Visitor Management (Source:\nProxyclick.com)_\n\n## Pricing and Purchasing Options\n\nMost systems require a monthly payment, but may differ on how that payment is\ncalculated. Here are some common pricing models:\n\n  *  **Per lobby, location or room.** Many systems offer pricing that increases with the number of lobbies the user needs to manage. Additional features or support services are available as pricing scales.\n\n  *  **Per visits or contacts.** Fewer VMS vendors price their systems in this way. However, if you have a small business with infrequent visitors, a system priced in this way may be more affordable.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that some vendors combine these pricing structures,\ne.g., a basic package may charge a flat monthly price for one lobby location\nand up to 25 visitors per day. Evaluate system providers to determine the plan\nthat makes the most sense for your needs.\n\n  * About Us\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Vendors\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * View All Categories\n\n  * \u00a9 2006-2024 Software Advice, Inc.\n\n  * User Terms\n\n  * Vendor Terms\n\n  * Community Guidelines\n\n  * Content Policy\n\n  * Content Policy FAQs\n\n  * Cookie Policy\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Data Protection Agreement\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your\nbrowser, mostly in the form of cookies.
