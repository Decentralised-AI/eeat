These\nvisitors include customers, delivery workers, job applicants, consultants,\ninspectors, students, and anyone else entering a workplace that isn\u2019t an\nemployee. Visitor management software automatically tracks and stores this\ninformation electronically, with little to no work needed from the user\u2019s\nside.\n\n  \n\nVMS products allow an efficient and quick sign-in process for guests and can\neasily gather their information, which is then transferred to a database.\nThese products can also help detect security threats by conducting background\nchecks during check-in and keeping track of where the guests are within the\nfacility. Once visitors are cleared, VMS applications can print name tags for\nthe guests, offer them directions, and alert employees that certain\nindividuals have arrived.\n\n  \n\nVisitor management applications are useful for hosting events or conferences\nwith a large number of people. Along with tracking and storing data, VMS tools\nare capable of retaining information for returning guests. Visitor information\ndatabases help businesses view a snapshot of their guest pool, as well as who\nenters their facility daily. They can also be a more cost-effective solution\nfor tracking and monitoring guests.\n\n  \n\n### Visitor Management Software Features\n\n  \n\nSome of the most common features found across VMS applications include:\n\n  \n\n  * Alerts/Notifications\n\n  * Accessible electronic log of all visitors\n\n  * Background Checks\n\n  * Badge management\n\n  * Delivery tracking & acceptance\n\n  * Electronic documents \n\n  * Guest/visitor database\n\n  * ID scanning\n\n  * ID badge printing\n\n  * Pre-registration\n\n  * Queue management \n\n  * Self-check-in/check-out\n\n  * Signature capture for legal documents\n\n  * Visitor photographing\n\n  * Watch list\n\n  \n  \n\n### Visitor Management Software Comparison\n\n  \n\nBefore investing in visitor management software, consider the following key\nfactors:\n\n  \n\n  * **Hardware & accessories**: Depending on what you are using the software for, you may want added hardware such as a name tag printer, kiosk computers, or tablets. These extra accessories can be useful when expecting a high volume of visitors for meetings or events, especially when it comes to streamlining guest check-in. Therefore, the type of hardware and accessories a vendor offers should be taken into account. \n\n  \n\n  * **Type of business** : Some VMS products are better-suited for a specific type of institution or industry. KeepnTrack, for example, is designed for schools and wouldn\u2019t be the ideal selection for a corporate setting. Though some products are designed to accommodate every setting, it is best to research which products will work best for your specific industry. \n\n  \n  \n\n### Pricing Information\n\n  \n\nSome vendors, such as Envoy and iLobby, offer a free version of their product\nwith limited features and number of users. Basic plans can range from $20 to\n$100 per month. Premium plans are the most expensive and typically cost over\n$100 per month. However, they offer\n\nGreater customization to fit the business\u2019s needs.\n\n  \n\nMost VMS will offer either a free version or a free trial of their platform.\nMake sure to take advantage of the free trial or version before deciding to\npurchase a new VMS platform.\n\n  \n\n## Related Categories\n\n  * Appointment Scheduling Software\n  * Card Management Systems\n  * Event Registration Software\n  * ID Card Software\n  * Video Surveillance Software\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n  * What does visitor management software do?\n  * What are the benefits of using visitor management software?\n  * How much does visitor management software cost?\n\n### What does visitor management software do?\n\nVisitor management software tracks everyone entering a building or office\nwhether they are customers, delivery workers, job applicants, consultants,\netc. The software does this by automatically capturing visitor information and\nstoring it in a database.\n\nThey can be deployed on a PC, tablet, or sometimes in a self-service kiosk.\nVisitor management systems replace sign-in pen and paper tools and have the\nmajor advantage that all data is stored in a database for easy retrieval if\nnecessary.
