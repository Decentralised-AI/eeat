Clients must prove\nthey are who they say they are and that their sources of funds are legitimate.\nThey need to prove their identity and produce documents verifying the\nlegitimacy of their information and onboarding application. Financial\ninstitutions may refuse to open an account or may cease an existing\nrelationship with a client if the client fails to meet KYC requirements.\n\n### What Are the Key Challenges of Conducting KYC?\n\n **There are 3 key challenges of conducting Know Your Customer.  \n  \n\u200d**Firstly, the KYC process is very information and document heavy. Clients\nmust prove they are who they say they are, and all monies associated with them\nhave a legitimate source. For financial institutions that do not have KYC\nautomation, the process of outreaching to clients to collect this information\nis quite haphazard and time-consuming. In fact, KYC is a key reason why client\nonboarding takes so long.  \n  \nSecondly, when the client information is submitted, it must be inputted and\nprocessed into the relevant systems. This can introduce a high level of human\nerror. The more manual a KYC process is, the more KYC specialists are required\nto manually input and review client information to make an assessment as to\nhow much risk the client poses to the institution. Due to the complexity of\nKYC reviews and the amount of information required to be sifted through, this\ncan lead to errors in judgment and inadvertently doing business with entities\nthat may harm the reputation of the financial institution. Furthermore, the\nmore people required to conduct Know Your Customer checks, the higher the cost\nof KYC compliance.  \n  \nThe final challenge comes in the form of regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, global\npenalties totalled $4.9 billion for KYC violations and non-compliance (Fenergo\nFines Report, 2022).\n\n### What is Perpetual KYC?\n\nPerpetual KYC (or PKYC) automates as much of the existing periodic KYC review\nprocess as possible. It means continuous monitoring of the client profile -\nidentifying changes across relevant data sources, assessing their risk impact,\nand applying materiality. With more frequent but fully automated incremental\nrefreshes, the client profile is kept up to date, so that when a review falls\ndue, the volume of work requiring human intervention is reduced.\n\n### What Are the Benefits of Perpetual KYC?\n\n **There are many benefits of P-KYC. Here are three core benefits for\nfinancial institutions.  \n**\n\n  1. Future-Proofed KYC Compliance: Perpetual KYC provides ongoing monitoring of a client\u2019s profile by validating previously collected information and continuously identifying and assessing changes in the client\u2019s profile on an ongoing basis. This ensures that the financial institution is continually capturing, flagging and acting upon information that may change the risk profile of a client.  \n  \n\n  2. Reduced Operational Burden: Perpetual KYC can significantly reduce the operational burden of work from KYC teams. By capturing changes in a client profile and measuring the materiality of these changes on an ongoing basis, financial institutions can eliminate the build-up of scheduled client reviews. By responding in real-time to changes that have material impacts, they can manage risk by exception and allow other non-material changes to be managed via straight through processing.  \n  \n\n  3. Reduced Operational Costs: The single biggest contributor to the cost of KYC compliance is people. Through advanced digitalization and optimization of the KYC review process, Perpetual KYC can deliver significant operational cost savings accrued by making better use of KYC specialists\u2019 time.\n\n## Want to Know More About Fenergo KYC?  \n\nContact us and we'll arrange for one of our KYC experts to show you how\nFenergo KYC can transform your compliance operations.  \n\nContact Us\n\nSolutions\n\nClient Lifecycle Management\n\nKnow Your Customer  \n(KYC)\n\nClient Onboarding\n\nTransaction Monitoring\n\nAccount Opening\n\nESG Compliance\n\nSegments\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\n\nCommercial & Business Banks\n\nBanca Universal o Banca M\u00faltiple\n\nAsset Management\n\nAsset Servicing\n\nPrivate Banking & Wealth Management\n\nResources\n\nSolution Brochures\n\nWhitepapers\n\nWebinars on demand\n\nCase Studies\n\nBlogs\n\nAnalyst Reports\n\nCompany\n\nDiscover Fenergo\n\nLeadership\n\nAwards\n\nThe Fenergo Brand\n\nQuick Links\n\nCareers\n\nClients\n\nPartners\n\nPlatform Overview\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy\n\nModern Slavery & Human Trafficking\n\nTrust & Security\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\u00a92023 Fenergo | All rights reserved\n\nCookies Settings\n\n **Other Solutions:  \n**\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC)\n\nClient Onboarding\n\nTransaction Monitoring\n\nAccount Opening\n\nPlease click on \"Cookie settings\" to set your preferences for the storing of\ncookies on your device.
