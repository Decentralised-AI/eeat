Each little measurement provides feedback. It offers a signal of\nwhether they are making progress or need to change course.\n\nGabrielle Hamilton, a chef in New York City, provides a good example. During\nan interview with the _New York Times_ , she said, \u201cThe one thing I see that\nconsistently separates the chef from the home cook is that we taste\neverything, all the time, before we commit it to the dish, right down to the\ngrains of salt. We slurp shot glasses of olive oil and aerate them in our\nmouths as if it were a wine we were trying to know. We taste the lamb, the\nfish, the butter, the milk before we use it\u2026 we chew salt to see how we like\nit in our teeth, on our tongues, and to know its flavor, its salinity.\u201d\n\nFor the chef, tasting the ingredients tells them whether they are making\nprogress toward their desired end goal. It provides the immediate feedback\nthey need to get the recipe _just right_.\n\nLike a chef improving a recipe through trial and error, we often improve our\nhabits through trial and error. If one approach doesn\u2019t deliver the desired\neffect, then we adjust\u2014like a chef tweaking the amount of an ingredient.\n\nHowever, there is an important difference between getting feedback while\ncooking a meal and getting feedback while building a habit. When it comes to\nbuilding a habit, feedback is often delayed. It\u2019s easy to taste an ingredient\nor to watch bread rise in the oven. But it can be difficult to visualize the\nprogress you are making with your habits. Perhaps you\u2019ve been running for a\nmonth, but you still don\u2019t see a change in your body. Or maybe you managed to\nmeditate for 16 straight days, but you still feel stressed and anxious at\nwork.\n\nHabit formation is a long race. It often takes time for the desired results to\nappear. And while you are waiting for the long-term rewards of your efforts to\naccumulate, you need a reason to stick with it in the short-term. You need\nsome immediate feedback that shows you are on the right path.\n\nAnd this is where a habit tracker can help.\n\n## The Habit Tracker: What It Is and How It Works\n\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.\n\nThe most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick\nwith your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and\nFriday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes\na record of your habit streak.\n\nTo make this process as easy as possible, I created the Habit Journal, which\nincludes 12 habit tracker templates\u2014one for each month. All you have to do is\nadd your habit and start crossing off the days.\n\nPlacing an X on each day is the classic look. I prefer something a little more\ndesign-oriented, so I shade in the cells on my habit tracker. You could also\nuse checkmarks or fill your habit tracker with dots.\n\nNo matter what design you choose, the key point is your habit tracker provides\nimmediate evidence that you completed your habit. It\u2019s a signal that you are\nmaking progress. Of course, that\u2019s not all it does\u2026\n\nHabit tracking is powerful for three reasons.\n\n  1. It creates a visual cue that can remind you to act.\n  2. It is motivating to see the progress you are making. You don\u2019t want to break your streak.\n  3. It feels satisfying to record your success in the moment.\n\nLet\u2019s break down each one.\n\n## Benefit #1: A habit tracker reminds you to act.\n\nHabit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues. When you look at the\ncalendar and see your streak, you\u2019ll be reminded to act again.\n\nResearch has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing\nweight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to\nimprove than those who don\u2019t. One study of more than sixteen hundred people\nfound that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those\nwho did not. A habit tracker is a simple way to log your behavior, and the\nmere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\n\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us think we act better than we\ndo. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior\nand notice what\u2019s really going on each day. When the evidence is right in\nfront of you, you\u2019re less likely to lie to yourself.\n\n## Benefit #2: A habit tracker motivates you to continue.\n\nThe most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that\nwe are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In\nthis way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each\nsmall win feeds your desire.\n\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you\u2019re feeling down, it\u2019s\neasy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking\nprovides visual proof of your hard work\u2014a subtle reminder of how far you\u2019ve\ncome. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get\nstarted because you don\u2019t want to lose your progress by breaking your streak.\n\n## Benefit #3: A habit tracker provides immediate satisfaction.\n\nFinally, tracking feels rewarding. It is satisfying to cross an item off your\nto-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the\ncalendar. It feels good to watch your results grow and if it feels good, then\nyou\u2019re more likely to endure.\n\nHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you\u2019re focused on the\nprocess rather than the result. You\u2019re not fixated on getting six-pack abs,\nyou\u2019re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who\ndoesn\u2019t miss workouts.\n\n## Habit Tracker Ideas\n\nAlright, those benefits sound great, but it\u2019s not necessary to fill your habit\ntracker with every habit that makes up your day. In fact, if you\u2019re already\nsticking to a habit, then it seems like extra work to me to track it as well.\nSo what should you measure in your habit tracker?\n\nHabit tracking can help kickstart a new habit or keep you on track with\nbehaviors that you tend to forget or let slide when things get busy.\n\nIn Atomic Habits, I recommend using the Two-Minute Rule, which suggests you\nscale your habits down until they take two minutes or less to perform. You can\ntrack whatever habits you want in your habit tracker, but I recommend starting\nwith these super small habits to make sure that you are at least showing up in\na small way each day. I\u2019ll share some examples below and break them out by\ndaily, weekly, and monthly habits.\n\n**Common daily habits to track:**\n\n  * journal 1 sentence\n  * read 1 page\n  * meditate 1 minute\n  * do 1 push up\n  * stretch for 1 minute\n  * write 1 thing I\u2019m grateful for\n  * make your bed\n  * wake up by [TIME]\n  * go to bed by [TIME]\n  * take a shower\n  * floss teeth\n  * weigh myself\n  * take medication\n  * take vitamins/supplements\n  * play [INSTRUMENT] for 1 minute\n  * contact 1 potential client\n  * prioritize to-do list\n  * say \u201cI love you\u201d at least once\n  * put all dishes put away\n  * take a walk outside\n  * call mom\n  * walk the dog\n\nNotice that most items on this list can be completed in two minutes or less.\nMake your habits so easy that you can stick to them even on the hard days.\n\nFor something to become truly habitual, you need to repeat it frequently. As a\nresult, most habits are daily. But it can also be helpful to use a habit\ntracker for various weekly or monthly routines. These behaviors won\u2019t become\n\u201cautomatic\u201d like tying your shoes or brushing your teeth, but a habit tracker\ncan remind you to complete them nonetheless.\n\n**Common weekly habits to track:**\n\n  * publish blog post\n  * vacuum\n  * take out trash/recycling\n  * do the laundry\n  * water the plants\n  * tidy up your bedroom\n  * write a thank you note\n\n**Monthly habits:**\n\n  * review finances\n  * transfer money to savings account\n  * pay off credit cards\n  * pay bills\n  * deep clean the house\n\nYou can also use a habit tracker to simply count how often you do something.\nFor example, if you want to keep track of how many days you travel for work\neach month.\n\n**Other ideas:**\n\n  * days spent traveling\n  * conduct weekly review\n  * conduct monthly review\n\nFinally, you can use a habit tracker to measure what you _don\u2019t_ do. I call\nthese \u201chabits of avoidance\u201d (that is, behaviors you are trying to avoid).\n\n**Habits of avoidance:**\n\n  * no alcohol\n  * no Netflix\n  * no online purchases\n  * no soda\n  * no sugar\n  * no caffeine\n  * no smoking\n\nAgain, the Habit Journal offers a proven template and the fastest way to\ncreate your habit tracker. No need to spend an hour drawing your own grid.\nJust write your habits down and you\u2019re ready to go.\n\n## How to Get in the Habit of Using Your Habit Tracker\n\nDespite all of the benefits, a habit tracker is not something that makes sense\nin every situation or for every person. Many people resist the idea of\ntracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden because it forces you into\ntwo habits: the habit you\u2019re trying to build and the habit of tracking it.\nThat said, nearly anyone can benefit from habit tracking in one form or\nanother\u2014even if it\u2019s only temporary.\n\nWhat can we do to make habit tracking easier?\n\nFirst, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is\nbetter to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten. I tend\nto keep my habit tracker simple and limit it to my three or four most\nimportant habits.\n\nSecond, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The\ncompletion of the habit is the cue to write it down. (This is a twist on the\n\u201chabit stacking\u201d approach I discuss in Chapter 5 of Atomic Habits.)\n\nHere\u2019s the basic formula: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\n\nFor example:\n\n  * After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will mark the \u201ccall 1 potential client\u201d column.\n  * After I finish meditating, I will fill the \u201cmeditate for 1 minute\u201d column.\n  * After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will complete the \u201cput all dishes away\u201d column.\n\nBasically, what we are talking about here is getting in the habit of using\nyour habit tracker. These little rules help you remember to pick up your habit\ntracker and mark off another accomplishment.\n\n## How to Recover Quickly When Your Habits Break Down\n\nFinally, I want to discuss what to do when you fall off the wagon.\n\nEvery habit streak ends at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before\nlong, an emergency will pop up\u2014you get sick or you have to travel for work or\nyour family needs a little more of your time. Whenever this happens to me, I\ntry to remind myself of a simple rule:\n\nNever miss twice.\n\nIf I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing\none workout happens, but I\u2019m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I\u2019ll eat an\nentire pizza, but I\u2019ll follow it up with a healthy meal. As soon as one streak\nends, I get started on the next one. I can\u2019t be perfect, but I can avoid the\nsecond mistake.\n\nGenerally speaking, the first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is\nthe spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. As I write in Atomic Habits,\n\u201cMissing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.\u201d\n\nToo often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem\nis not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can\u2019t do something\nperfectly, then you shouldn\u2019t do it at all.\n\nSure, a perfectly filled-in habit tracker looks beautiful and you should\nstrive to achieve it whenever possible. But life is messy. In the long run,\nwhat matters is that you find a way to get back on track.\n\n## How Long Do I Need to Track My Habits?\n\nOne of the most common questions I get is \u201cHow long does it take to build a\nhabit?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll see all kinds of answers: 21 days, 30 days, 100 days. One popular\nanswer right now is 66 days because there was one study that found that, on\naverage, it took 66 days to build a habit. However, even within that study the\nrange was quite wide depending on the difficulty of the habit.\n\nI find that people are really trying to get at something else when they ask,\n\u201cHow long does it take to build a habit?\u201d What they often mean is, \u201cHow long\nuntil it\u2019s easy? How long until I don\u2019t have to put much effort in anymore?\u201d\n\nLook, all habits get easier with practice. But this line of questioning\nignores the real purpose of building better habits in the first place.\n\nHow long does it take? The honest answer is: forever. Because once you stop\ndoing it, it is no longer a habit.\n\nA habit is a lifestyle to be lived, not a finish line to be crossed. You are\nlooking to make small, sustainable changes you can stick with for years. And a\nhabit tracker is one tool in your toolbox on the road to behavior change. It\nis an effective way to visualize your progress and motivate you to show up\nagain tomorrow.\n\n_This article is an excerpt from Chapter 16 of my New York Times bestselling\nbook  Atomic Habits.

Sure, there are some habits that lend themselves to more immediate signs of progress. Even if you haven\u2019t hit retirement yet, you can still watch your savings grow with each deposit. And while your book manuscript may need more work, you can see the word count increasing after each writing session. But even in these cases, it can be helpful to have a simple way to take stock of where you stand.\n\n  3. As I mentioned in Atomic Habits, I use the term habit stacking to refer to linking a new habit to an old one. For this idea, I give credit to BJ Fogg. In his work, Fogg uses the term anchoring to describe this approach because your old habit acts as an \u201canchor\u201d that keeps the new one in place. No matter what term you prefer, I believe it is a very effective strategy.
