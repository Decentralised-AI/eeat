I\u2019m a big fan of Atomic Habits (a book that I highly recommend) that\n> is life changing and this app is the perfect tool for something like that.\n> It is so customizable in colors, emojis, themes and that makes it more fun\n> and visually appealing to use. It also has suggested habits to help if you\n> get stuck. I used to write my habits in a planner or paper but found it was\n> hard to keep up because I don\u2019t carry a planner around with me everywhere I\n> go as much as my phone. This app is so much more convenient and because it\n> has everything I need and I come back and use it daily. That makes it for it\n> to be an effective habit tracker and builder. Props to the development team\n> for being so thoughtful on this app. Thank you!!\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> The basic feature allows 5-6 free habits and the premium features allow\n> more. I\u2019ve been using the free plan for a week and I\u2019m in love with it and\n> am considering upgrading. They are also one of the rare few to let you buy\n> lifetime membership for one price which makes me think of the old days when\n> apps first came out. I prefer that so much more than subscription model I\n> would later cancel when I\u2019m on a budget. Highly recommend this app to build\n> better habits and change your life!\n>\n> more\n\n###  Developer Response  ,\n\n> Thanks for your support, we will keep improving this app\n>\n> more\n\nSer_Ser_dc  ,  11/02/2022\n\n###  I genuinely love it!\n\n> It\u2019s an all around good app! It has helped me pray the rosary everyday. I\n> currently have a 313 day streak so I\u2019ve been using the app for about a year\n> now. It has basically become apart of my daily life. I\u2019m up to over 10\n> habits right now lol. With my ADHD I find it hard to remember what to do.\n> But when I have to look at it every and see what I have and haven\u2019t done\n> it\u2019s really good. It works especially great with another app great for ADHD,\n> Structured. It is a time management app which is great. As much as I love\n> this app and literally it keeps my life kind of together-ish I can\u2019t seem to\n> add any widgets to my Lock Screen. I would TOTALLY give this a five. But I\n> can\u2019t add the widget so it\u2019s a four. And, when I asked them about it some\n> how they didn\u2019t understand what I wad saying. When I go to my Lock Screen so\n> Edit the widget it brings me to the app and literally nothing happens. I\n> tapped Edit widget and it brings me to the app, then I tapped a habit\n> thinking that even though there was NO indication that I was in edit mode it\n> would still add some how. NOPE didn\u2019t work. If just brings me to the habit\n> where I can edit it or look at my streak. It doesn\u2019t add the widget to my\n> Lock Screen. It works perfectly fine for my Home Screen so I don\u2019t know why\n> it doesn\u2019t work for my Lock Screen. I love this app so it was sad. And I\u2019m\n> frustrated. Hopefully they make it so there\u2019s a different interface when in\n> editing mode. \ud83d\udc95\n>\n> more\n\nAninaline  ,  01/04/2023\n\n###  Best habit tracker for iOS\n\n> I used the free version of this app for about a year and it has many great\n> features. I recently paid for the lifetime subscription because I wanted the\n> reports and extra features. The subscriptions are affordable and very much\n> worth it, in my opinion. I love that there are so many different ways to\n> track habits, like daily, or 20 minutes a day, or 4 hours a week.\n>\n>  \n>  \n>\n>\n> I recently made goals for the year and was able to start tracking every\n> single one I wanted to in the app. My one small feature request would be to\n> allow you to edit the frequency/time of a habit after it has been made.\n> Like, right now, my goal may be to practice piano three times a week for 20\n> minutes, but if I wanted to change it to four times a week for 30 minutes\n> next month, I would either have to change the habit and reset all my data\n> for it or archive it and make a new one with my new goal.\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> Overall, though, this is an amazing app that is getting regular updates and\n> is very well thought out. I highly recommend it if you are looking to set\n> some goals and build new habits. I set one habit on it daily with an alarm\n> to remind me to track my habit at the end of the day, and I have been doing\n> so successfully for months now.\n>\n> more\n\n##  App Privacy\n\nSee Details\n\nThe developer, Davetech Co., Ltd., indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices\nmay include handling of data as described below.
