Also, don't trust the overall rating. If\nyou indicate through the app that you'd give it a low rating, it directs you\nto sending an email, but if you indicate you'd give it a high rating, it\ndirects you to its page on Google Play, which is otherwise hard to find after\ninstall.\n\n109 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nHi, sorry for the inconvenience.

I'd love to see the ability to add\nseparate reminders for each repetition of a task throughout the day.\nCurrently, there's only an option to set one reminder for a task, even if it's\nscheduled to repeat multiple times a day. Additionally, on the 'Today' page,\nhabits are sorted by creation time by default. It would be fantastic if there\nwere options to sort them by reminder time, importance, or other customizable\nparameters. Looking forward to future updates!\n\n33 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nHi Emad, thanks for your valuable advice.

Have a nice day~ \u2764\ufe0f\n\nZephyrus Koryami (Nite Skye)\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n\nOctober 19, 2023\n\nVery sweet n simple layout, organized by lists of morning, afternoon, and\nevening. You can type the name, choose from a wide selection of funky icons,\nadd a color theme, (limited on the free account) set an alarm, choose the\nday(s), set the type: duration(i.e 15min), repeat(1/3 times), etc. The above\nand beyond is that it can also track bad habits you want to break. Lol, sets\noff a little \"yaay\" w/ confetti when you achieve things. I give it 5 stars.\nMay have like one ad when you open the app.\n\n87 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSee all reviews\n\n _flag_ Flag as inappropriate\n\n## App support\n\n _expand_more_\n\n _public_\n\nWebsite\n\n _email_\n\nSupport email\n\nsupport@leap.app\n\n _place_\n\nAddress\n\n152 BEACH ROAD #14-02 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE\n\n _shield_\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n## More by Leap Fitness Group\n\n _arrow_forward_\n\nHome Workout - No Equipment\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.9 _star_\n\nStep Counter - Pedometer\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.9 _star_\n\nDownloader - Video Downloader\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.5 _star_\n\nLose Weight App for Women\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.9 _star_\n\nLose Weight App for Men\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.9 _star_\n\nWorkout for Women: Fit at Home\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.8 _star_\n\n##  Similar apps\n\n _arrow_forward_\n\nForest: Focus for Productivity\n\nSeekrtech\n\n4.7 _star_\n\nHabitNow Daily Routine Planner\n\nHabitNow\n\n4.8 _star_\n\nFasting - Intermittent Fasting\n\nLeap Fitness Group\n\n4.9 _star_\n\nTo-Do List - Schedule Planner\n\nDairy App & Notes & Audio Editor & Voice Recorder\n\n4.7 _star_\n\nFabulous Daily Routine Planner\n\nTheFabulous\n\n4.3 _star_\n\nFLIP - Focus Timer for Study\n\nRinaSoft\n\n4.6 _star_\n\n _flag_ Flag as inappropriate\n\nGoogle Play\n\nPlay Pass\n\nPlay Points\n\nGift cards\n\nRedeem\n\nRefund policy\n\nKids & family\n\nParent Guide\n\nFamily sharing\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy\n\nAbout Google Play\n\nDevelopers\n\nGoogle Store\n\nUnited States (English)\n\n",
