You can get it from supplements and in certain\nfoods like nuts and leafy greens.**\n\nFrom regulating blood sugar levels to boosting athletic performance, magnesium\nis crucial for your brain and body.\n\nYet, although it\u2019s found in various foods ranging from leafy greens to nuts,\nseeds, and beans, many people don\u2019t get enough in their diet.\n\nHere are 12 evidence-based health benefits of magnesium and some simple ways\nto increase your intake.\n\n##\n\n1\\. Involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in your body\n\nMagnesium is found throughout your body. Every cell in your body contains this\nmineral and needs it to function.\n\nAbout 60% of the magnesium in your body occurs in bone, while the rest is in\nmuscles, soft tissues, and fluids, including blood (1Trusted Source).\n\nOne of its main roles is to act as a cofactor \u2014 a helper molecule \u2014 in the\nbiochemical reactions continuously performed by enzymes. It\u2019s involved in more\nthan 600 reactions in your body, including (2):\n\n  *  **Energy creation:** converting food into energy\n  *  **Protein formation:** creating new proteins from amino acids\n  *  **Gene maintenance:** helping create and repair DNA and RNA\n  *  **Muscle movements:** aiding in muscle contraction and relaxation\n  *  **Nervous system regulation:** regulating neurotransmitters, which send messages throughout your brain and nervous system\n\nNonetheless, studies suggest that approximately 50% of U.S. adults get less\nthan the recommended daily amount of magnesium (1Trusted Source, 3Trusted\nSource).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium supports hundreds of chemical reactions in your body. However,\n> many people get less than they need.\n\nShare on PinterestJelena Lalic/Getty Images\n\n##\n\n2\\. May boost exercise performance\n\nYou may need more magnesium during exercise than when you\u2019re resting,\ndepending on the activity (4).\n\nMagnesium helps move blood sugar into your muscles and dispose of lactate,\nwhich can build up during exercise and cause fatigue (5Trusted Source).\n\nStudies show magnesium supplements may be particularly beneficial for\nimproving exercise performance in older adults and those with a deficiency in\nthis nutrient (6Trusted Source).\n\nOne older study of 2,570 women associated higher magnesium intake with\nincreased muscle mass and power (7Trusted Source).\n\nIn a 2019 study, professional male cyclists players who took 400 mg of\nmagnesium per day for 3 weeks experienced improvements in muscle recovery and\nprotection from muscle damage following a strenuous race, compared to cyclists\ntaking a placebo (8Trusted Source).\n\nHowever, more studies are needed, as some research suggests that supplementing\ndoesn\u2019t help athletes or active people with adequate magnesium levels\n(6Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium supplements have been shown to enhance exercise performance in\n> several studies, but results are mixed.\n\n##\n\n3\\. May combat depression\n\nMagnesium plays a critical role in brain function and mood; low levels are\nlinked to an increased risk of depression (9Trusted Source).\n\nA 2020 review suggested that stress may deplete magnesium, increasing\nsusceptibility to stress and depression (9Trusted Source).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, supplementing with this mineral may help reduce symptoms of\ndepression (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\n\nIn one small 8-week study, taking 500 mg of magnesium daily led to significant\nimprovements in symptoms of depression in people with a deficiency in this\nmineral (11Trusted Source).\n\nPlus, a 6-week study in 126 people showed that taking 248 mg of magnesium per\nday decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety, regardless of magnesium\nstatus (10Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium deficiency may be linked to depression. As such, supplementing may\n> help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n##\n\n4\\. May support healthy blood sugar levels\n\nStudies suggest that about 48% of people with type 2 diabetes have low blood\nlevels of magnesium, which may impair the body\u2019s ability to regulate blood\nsugar levels effectively (1Trusted Source, 1Trusted Source2Trusted Source).\n\nAdditionally, research indicates that people who consume more magnesium have a\nlower risk of type 2 diabetes (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\n\nAccording to one review, magnesium supplements help enhance insulin\nsensitivity, a key factor in blood sugar control (15Trusted Source).\n\nAnother review reported that magnesium supplements improved blood sugar levels\nand insulin sensitivity in people at risk for type 2 diabetes (15Trusted\nSource).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium supplements may improve blood sugar levels, insulin sensitivity,\n> and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n\n##\n\n5\\. May promote heart health\n\nMagnesium plays an important role in keeping your heart healthy and strong.\n\nA 2021 review shows that magnesium supplements can help lower high blood\npressure levels, which may be a risk factor for heart disease (16Trusted\nSource).\n\nAnother review linked high magnesium intake to a lower risk of heart disease,\nstroke, and high blood pressure (17Trusted Source).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, one review found that magnesium supplements improved multiple\nrisk factors for heart disease, including triglyceride, LDL (bad) cholesterol,\nHDL (good) cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure levels, especially in\npeople with a magnesium deficiency (18Trusted Source).\n\nHowever, more research is needed, as other research has found no effect of\nmagnesium on cholesterol or triglyceride levels (19Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium may help lower blood pressure levels and reduce several risk\n> factors for heart disease. Still, more research is needed.\n\n##\n\n6\\. Boasts anti-inflammatory benefits\n\nLow magnesium intake is linked to increased levels of inflammation, which\nplays a crucial role in aging and chronic disease (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted\nSource).\n\nOne review of 11 studies concluded that magnesium supplements decreased levels\nof C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, in people with chronic\ninflammation (22Trusted Source).\n\nOther studies report similar findings, showing that magnesium supplements may\nreduce CRP and other markers of inflammation, such as interleukin-6 (23Trusted\nSource, 24Trusted Source).\n\nFurthermore, some research ties magnesium deficiency to increased oxidative\nstress, which is related to inflammation (25Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium has been shown to help fight inflammation by reducing markers such\n> as CRP and interleukin-6.\n\n##\n\n7\\. May help prevent migraine attacks\n\nMigraine headaches can be painful and often cause nausea, vomiting, and\nsensitivity to light and noise (26Trusted Source).\n\nSome researchers believe that people with migraine are more likely than others\nto have a magnesium deficiency (27Trusted Source).\n\nSeveral studies suggest that magnesium supplements may even prevent and treat\nmigraine headaches (28Trusted Source).\n\nIn one older study, supplementing with 1 gram of magnesium provided relief\nfrom acute migraine attacks more quickly and effectively than a common\nmedication (29Trusted Source).\n\nEating more magnesium-rich foods may also help reduce migraine symptoms\n(30Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> People with migraine may have low magnesium levels. Some studies show that\n> supplementing with this mineral may provide relief from migraine attacks.\n\n##\n\n8\\. May improve PMS symptoms\n\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common conditions in female-\nbodied people of childbearing age. It often causes symptoms such as water\nretention, abdominal cramps, tiredness, and irritability (31Trusted Source).\n\nSome research suggests that magnesium supplements help relieve PMS symptoms\nand other conditions such as menstrual cramps and migraine attacks (32Trusted\nSource).\n\nThis may be because magnesium levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle,\nworsening PMS symptoms in those with a deficiency. As such, supplements may\nhelp reduce the severity of symptoms, including menstrual migraine attacks\n(33).\n\nOne study found that taking 300 mg of magnesium daily helped decrease\nbloating, depression, and anxiety in college students with PMS compared with a\ncontrol group (34).\n\nStill, more recent, high quality studies are needed to determine whether this\nmineral can improve symptoms regardless of your magnesium levels.\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Some studies suggest that magnesium supplements help improve PMS symptoms,\n> though more research is necessary.\n\n##\n\n9\\. May promote bone health\n\nMagnesium is crucial for maintaining bone health and protecting against bone\nloss. In fact, 50\u201360% of your body\u2019s magnesium is found in your bones\n(35Trusted Source).\n\nSome studies associate lower levels of this mineral with a higher risk of\nosteoporosis, which causes bones to become brittle and weak (36Trusted\nSource).\n\nA 3-year study in 358 people undergoing hemodialysis \u2014 a treatment to help\nremove waste and water from the blood \u2014 showed that those who consumed the\nleast magnesium experienced three times more fractures than those with the\nhighest intake (37Trusted Source).\n\nMoreover, one recent review of 12 studies linked high magnesium intake to\nincreased bone mineral density in the hip and femoral neck, both areas\nsusceptible to fracture (38).\n\n> **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium is important for bone health. Some studies tie a higher intake to\n> a lower risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and bone loss.\n\n##\n\n10\\. May support better sleep\n\nMagnesium supplements are often used as a natural remedy for sleep issues such\nas insomnia.\n\nThis is because magnesium regulates several neurotransmitters involved in\nsleep, such as gamma aminobutyric acid (39Trusted Source).\n\nOne review of older adults with insomnia found that magnesium supplements\nlowered the amount of time it took people to fall asleep by an average of 17\nminutes (40Trusted Source).\n\nAnother study in nearly 4,000 adults linked increased intake of this mineral\nto improved sleep quality and duration (41Trusted Source).\n\nFurthermore, another study associated higher magnesium intake in women with a\nreduced likelihood of falling asleep during the daytime (42Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Increasing your intake of magnesium through foods or supplements may help\n> treat certain sleep issues and improve sleep quality.\n\n##\n\n11\\. May help reduce anxiety symptoms\n\nSome research suggests that magnesium helps treat and prevent anxiety\n(43Trusted Source).\n\nFor example, one study of 3,172 Iranian adults associated increased magnesium\nintake with a lower risk of depression and anxiety (44).\n\nSimilarly, a small 6-week study found that taking 248 mg of magnesium daily\nsignificantly reduced anxiety symptoms (10Trusted Source).\n\nOther research suggests that magnesium deficiency may increase your body\u2019s\nsusceptibility to stress, which may amplify symptoms of anxiety (45Trusted\nSource).\n\nOne review concluded that magnesium supplements might help reduce mild to\nmoderate anxiety but noted that research is conflicting \u2014 and that the effects\nof supplements haven\u2019t been studied beyond 3 months (46).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Magnesium may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and decrease stress, but more\n> studies are needed.\n\n##\n\n12\\. Safe and widely available\n\nMagnesium is essential for many aspects of health. The recommended daily\nintake is 400\u2013420 mg for males and 310\u2013320 mg for females (35Trusted Source).\n\nYou can get this mineral from both food and supplements.\n\n### Food sources\n\nThe following foods are rich in magnesium (35Trusted Source):\n\n  *  **Pumpkin seeds:** 37% of the DV per ounce (28 grams)\n  *  **Chia seeds:** 26% of the DV per ounce (28 grams)\n  *  **Spinach, boiled:** 19% of the DV per 1/2 cup (90 grams)\n  *  **Almonds:** 19% of the DV per ounce (28 grams)\n  *  **Cashews:** 18% of the DV per ounce (28 grams)\n  *  **Black beans, cooked:** 14% of the DV per 1/2 cup (86 grams)\n  *  **Edamame, cooked:** 12% of the DV per 1/2 cup (78 grams)\n  *  **Peanut butter:** 12% of the DV per 2 tablespoons (32 grams)\n  *  **Brown rice, cooked:** 10% of the DV per 1/2 cup (100 grams)\n  *  **Salmon, cooked:** 6% of the DV per 3 ounces (85 grams)\n  *  **Halibut, cooked:** 6% of the DV per 3 ounces (85 grams)\n  *  **Avocado:** 5% of the DV per 1/2 cup (75 grams)\n\n### Supplements\n\nIf you have a medical condition, check with your doctor before taking\nmagnesium supplements. Though these supplements are generally well tolerated,\nthey may be unsafe for people who take certain diuretics, heart medications,\nosteoporosis medications, proton pump inhibitors, or antibiotics (47Trusted\nSource).\n\nForms that tend to be absorbed well include magnesium citrate, glycinate,\norotate, and carbonate (3Trusted Source).\n\n>  **Summary**\n>\n> Getting enough magnesium is vital for your health. Many foods contain it,\n> and many high quality supplements are available.\n\n##\n\nIs it OK to take magnesium every day?\n\nMagnesium is generally well-tolerated if you take an amount within the\nrecommended daily intake of 400\u2013420 mg for males and 310\u2013320 mg for females\n(35Trusted Source).\n\nIf you take other medications or supplements, it is best to talk with a doctor\nor pharmacist to prevent drug interactions.\n\n##\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n### What are 10 signs of low magnesium?\n\nSigns and symptoms of low magnesium levels are rare but may include (35Trusted\nSource) :\n\n  * loss of appetite\n  * nausea and vomiting\n  * fatigue\n  * numbness and tingling\n  * muscle contractions and cramps \n  * seizures\n  * personality changes\n  * abnormal heart rhythms\n  * hypocalcemia (low serum calcium) \n  * hypokalemia (potassium levels) \n\n### What is magnesium good for in women?\n\nSome research suggests that magnesium may help relieve symptoms of several\nconditions that affect women, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), polycystic\novary syndrome (PCOS), and symptoms associated with postmenopause (48).\n\n### Who should not take magnesium?\n\nMagnesium may interact with some medications. Speak with your healthcare\nprofessional before you take magnesium supplements if you take any of these\nmedications (35Trusted Source):\n\n  * antibiotics, including: \n    * demeclocycline (Declomycin) \n    * doxycycline (Vibramycin) \n    * ciprofloxacin (Cipro) \n    * levofloxacin (Levaquin) \n\n  * bisphosphonates (for osteoporosis) \n  * diuretics (to reduce excess water and salt for conditions like high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and others) \n  * proton pump inhibitors (reduces stomach acid)\n\n##\n\nThe bottom line\n\nMagnesium is essential for maintaining good health and plays a key role in\neverything from exercise performance to heart health and brain function.\n\nEnjoying a variety of magnesium-rich foods may ensure you\u2019re getting enough of\nthis nutrient in your diet. Spinach, chia seeds, peanut butter, and avocados\nare a few examples that make great additions to smoothies, snacks, and other\ndishes.\n\nSome multivitamin formulations may contain magnesium, and magnesium\nsupplements don\u2019t typically cause side effects.\n\nStill, study results should be interpreted with a grain of salt. Following a\nbalanced diet is more important than focusing on a single nutrient. Remember\nthat magnesium is not guaranteed to provide any of the results above.\n\n### Just one thing\n\n _Try this today:_ For a simple and delicious way to increase your magnesium\nintake, make a homemade trail mix with a few of your favorite nuts and seeds.\nNot only is this treat packed with nutrients, but it\u2019s also a great on-the-go\nsnack.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nLast medically reviewed on December 6, 2023\n\n### How we reviewed this article:\n\nHistory\n\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update\nour articles when new information becomes available.\n\nCurrent Version\n\nDec 6, 2023\n\nWritten By\n\nRachael Ajmera, MS, RD, Franziska Spritzler\n\nEdited By\n\nDebbie Nurmi\n\nMedically Reviewed By\n\nKatherine Marengo, LDN, RD\n\nCopy Edited By\n\nCopy Editors\n\nOct 30, 2023\n\nWritten By\n\nRachael Ajmera, MS, RD, Franziska Spritzler\n\nEdited By\n\nHeather Hobbs\n\nCopy Edited By\n\nCopy Editors\n\nVIEW ALL HISTORY\n\nShare this article\n\nMedically reviewed by Katherine Marengo LDN, R.D., Nutrition \u2014 Written by\nRachael Ajmera, MS, RD and Franziska Spritzler \u2014  Updated on December 6, 2023\n\n## Was this article helpful?\n\nYesNo\n\n### Read this next\n\n  * 10 Magnesium-Rich Foods That Are Super Healthy\n\nWritten by Franziska Spritzler\n\nMagnesium is a very important nutrient that most people don't get enough of.\nHere are 10 magnesium-rich foods that are also super healthy.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n  * Mineral Deficiency\n\nMedically reviewed by Natalie Butler, R.D., L.D.\n\nYour body requires many minerals to function properly.
