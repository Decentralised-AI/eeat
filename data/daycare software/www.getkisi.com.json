This stands true even for childcare\norganizations, like daycare centers, nurseries, preschools, and similar child-\ncentered facilities.\n\nTechnology helps in bridging the gap between children and parents, keeping\nthem safe and connected while separated. This way, the child care centers can\nfocus exclusively on the children since they can rely on their childcare\nmanagement software to take care of the rest.\n\nThe development and progress the childcare management software has experienced\nshaped the new childcare era. It's not just another app that looks good on\npaper but will actually make the parents' and administrators' lives more\ncomplicated. On the contrary, the right software improves crucial areas like\nhandling office administration, attendance, staff management, analytics, and\nphysical security even.\n\nAs with child care systems around the globe, not all childcare management\nsoftware are the same. They all come with a variety of features, focusing on\nthe ones that best serve their market. Still, most of the more prominent ones\nboast similar features:\n\n  * Staff scheduling and management\n  * Classroom occupancy management\n  * Contactless check-in and -out\n  * Attendance tracking\n  * Billing and payments\n  * Enrolment\n  * Assessment\n  * Daily reports\n  * Development reports\n  * Instant messaging\n  * Photos and videos sharing\n  * Child profiles\n  * Menus\n\nDeciding on the right solution can be challenging with so many childcare\nmanagement software options, especially in the not-so-tech-prone sectors.\nGetting distracted by the bells and whistles or feeling a bit threatened by\nthe tech-talk is easy.\n\nChildren are our future, and we must ensure they get all the quality care we\ncan offer. Before we dive deeper into the different solutions, let's look at\nthe childcare management software market.\n\nSave Time. Enhance Security.\n\nModernize your access control with remote management and useful integrations.\n\nGet demo  Learn more\n\n## The Childcare Management Software Market\n\nAs care centers are trying to get back to normal, we recognize the COVID-19\npandemic facilitated a dramatic shift in the childcare management landscape.\nIn March 2020, many child care organizations were forced to close temporarily,\nand some had to close permanently.\n\nWhile most child care centers have reopened, the virus is still a major\nconcern. So are maintaining enrolment and staffing. Like many other\nbusinesses, chances are not every child center will prevail. That\u2019s why\nmonitoring attendance rates and keeping up with the latest childcare industry\ntrends is essential.\n\nThis turbulent environment stimulated the development of the childcare\nmanagement software market growth. According to Technavio Research Analysis,\nit is expected to increase by USD 62.21 million (from 2019 to 2024). The\nmarket\u2019s growth momentum will likely accelerate at a compound annual growth\nrate (CAGR) of almost 7% (2021\u20132025).\n\nSource\n\n### Childcare Market Size\n\nThe U.S. childcare market was valued at USD 54.3 billion in 2019 and is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% from 2020 to 2027. The increased number of\nworking parents, hence the subsequent demand for child care, is expected to\ndrive the child care market in the years to come.\n\nA new BestColleges survey reported that inadequate child care access has\nhindered 32% of parents/guardians achieve their career goals and prevented or\npostponed some career-related activities for more than half of them (56%).\nTwo-fifths of the respondents (40%) reported having to sacrifice something in\ntheir life because of it.\n\nThe rising awareness about the link between parental employment, economic\ngrowth, and access to childcare is expected to boost the child care centers'\navailability.\n\nThe increased number of daycare and early education centers in the US\ncontributed to the dominion of these segments in the market.\n\nPre-pandemic, the demand for early education was quickly growing, with 1.4\nmillion and 3.7 million students enrolled in prekindergarten and kindergarten\nin 2019.\n\nSource\n\n### Childcare Market Trends\n\nThe child care market is expected to grow by USD 153.63 bn between 2020 and\n2025 at a CAGR of 12.78%, according to Technavio. Factors like low enrolments\nin developing countries will hinder while the growing parent awareness and the\nrising number of nuclear families will drive the market growth.\n\nNorth America, led by the US and Canada, will be the dominating region,\nexpected to account for 35% of the market growth during this period.\n\nGiven the market fragmentation, the vendors are deploying various growth\nstrategies to stay competitive. Choosing the right childcare management\nsoftware or upgrading the existing one can be an excellent growth opportunity.\n\nSource\n\n### Childcare Management Software Players\n\nNorth America accounted for the largest child care management software market\nshare.

They also offer a 90 days\nfree trial and a customized enterprise package.\n\nSource: Kangarootime\n\n### HiMama\n\nHiMama is a cloud-based child care management solution that helps childcare\nproviders streamline operations, delight families, and improve program\nquality!\n\nCommunicating with parents, center management, automated billing and payments,\nrunning assessments, staff training and development, and creating lesson plans\nare just some of HiMama's childcare app useful features.\n\nParents and teachers can work together to support children's development at\nhome and the care center using HiMama's parent communication, child\nportfolios, and observations and updates.\n\nThey also offer a bunch of quality resources in their HiMama Academy,\ncurriculum planning, and educator resources to help care providers grow and\ndevelop.\n\n#### HiMama Positive Reviews\n\n\u201cWe have been using HiMama for a couple years now and have loved it.

The standards are already programmed into the\nsoftware. We love this program at our childcare center. They have more than\nstepped up to help us during COVID and families being home. They now provide\ndaily lessons to send to our families, more data features to store\ntemperatures, and they support team is beyond compare.\u201d\n\n#### HiMama Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cI would really like to see improvement on the milestones tracking. It doesn't\nlet you get as detailed as needed. It will let me choose the name of the\nmilestone that we're working on (like fine motor skills), but doesn't get down\nto the details of what specifically I saw that day. It also takes so many\nclicks to track something that we just don't even bother. Luckily, we don't\nhave so many kids that it's hard to remember who is able to do what.\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### HiMama Pricing\n\nHiMama is highly customizable, and its pricing seems to vary depending on the\ncare center's size and needs.

With COVID and moving to a new facility, this app was necessary for\nour success. The parent interface is extremely easy and intuitive. Parents\nhave been telling us how quick it was to set up an account and to go through\ndaily wellness checks and sign in/out. The foundation of scanning a QR code to\nsign in and using the Carline to sign out dramatically improved our efficiency\nfrom our old paper sign in system.\"\n\n#### Playground Negative Reviews\n\n\"There is sometimes bad cell reception near our facility making the app\nglitch.\"\n\n _Source_ Capterra\n\n### Sawyer\n\nSawyer is a cloud-based camp and activity management solution that offers\nbooking and scheduling services for children\u2019s after-school class providers,\ncamps, and events.

Highly recommend!\u201d\n\n#### Sawyer Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cThe hardest part is not having quick access to a live person when I am having\nan issue that is not on your training rubric. When money is involved, the\nanxiety gets high. So, having customer service people we may actually talk to\nwould be my biggest hope. Or not waiting 24 hours for a response for help.\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### Sawyer Pricing\n\nSawyer offers 4 pricing plans based on the current and potential business\nneeds.

It is making\nthe process of sharing information with families so much easier and faster.\nThere are a lot of great features on the app. The daily reports, event\nplanning, the calendar, etc. The more I work with it the more hidden treasures\nI find. One just really needs the training to understand all the features and\nbe able to use them.\u201d\n\n#### Parent Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cThe most important \"SEARCH\" is missing from the app. The app is also not user\nfriendly for staff to share data among themselves. They have no options to\nshare information, articles etc without enabling the send message option(\nwhich also gives parents to send messgae directly). The latest updates have\nbeen really annoying and has led to lot of disappointment from staff and\nparents.\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### Parent Pricing\n\nParent's pricing policy is based on the number of children.

Our company switched over to this program over a year ago and\nusing it has never been an issue for me!\u201d\n\n#### Procare Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cLimited functionality and very basic. Even with a DEBIT card, Procare charges\na 2% transaction fee. Can't set up an autodraft from the parent portal and\ntherefore can't set the date of when you would like an autodraft to be\ncompleted. No support resources from the parent portal. The parent portal is\nVERY basic and there isn't much functionality.

From the web-based system, to the\neasy attendance and billing, to helpful reports, Sandbox truly excels in\nchildcare support.\u201d\n\n#### Sandbox Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cNo ability for parents to respond to posts made by teachers therefore very\nhard to receive feedback on our programs. App often glitches. Updates often\ndon't work (released before bugs are worked out).\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### Sandbox Pricing\n\nSandbox's pricing depends on the number of children. The plans start at $59\nper month for 0-24 children.

It's very user friendly and helps me keep track\nof what the kids ate, who's all here, and the monthly calendar is a great tool\ntoo. I was a little intimidated by it at first but one I learned the ropes it\nwas easy!\u201d\n\n#### Kidkare Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cIt can rearrange the list either alphabetically, or date of birth, or the\ncreated date. Can be made more user friendly. It often has technical issues\nand takes time to load. A couple of times caused error, which delayed the\npayment.\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### Kidkare Pricing\n\nBoth KidKare Food Program for Centers and KidKare Accounting are priced $99\nper month for a 12-month commitment.\n\nSource: KidKare\n\n### Smartcare\n\nSmartcare is a cloud-based childcare solution that simplifies the process of\nmanaging a daycare, preschool, and other programs.

It also keeps great track of employee's timecards\nwhich makes payroll a breeze for me.\n\nBilling, admissions, not user friendly, can only be used with Chrome-many\nparents use Safari or other web browsers. Very slow if any turn around on\ndevelopment ticket items, so many glitches, not user friendly, not capable of\nbilling for the current month.\u201d\n\n#### Smartcare Negative Reviews\n\n\u201cvery difficult to use, information is disorganized. Simple tasks are super\nhard.\u201d\n\n _Source_ : Capterra\n\n#### Smartcare Pricing\n\nSmartcare offers 4 different pricing plans: In-Home Centers, Smartcare,\nPreschool2Me, and Smartcare + Preschool2Me.

Without much\ndifferentiation and a plethora of available childcare management software\noptions, you might find yourself postponing the buying decision or sticking\nwith the old ways. The positive side of the many alternatives on the market is\nthat you have the opportunity to choose one that best suits your specific\nbusiness needs and budget.\n\nMost childcare management software aim to help care centers focus on their\ncore - taking care of the children. They support this by automating the basic\nadministrative operation, improving parent communication, and stimulating\ndevelopment.\n\nSo what is the best childcare management software? That depends on your care\ncenter's size, needs, and budget. They all have pros and cons but will\nstreamline your care center management. Having that added layer of security,\nlike mobile door access control, is a game changer for us. Parents like to\nkeep up with their children daily while having the peace of mind that they are\nsafe and secure at the daycare facility.\n\n## How Can Software Providers Win the Childcare Management Software Race?\n\nThriving in the saturated childcare management software market is not a walk\nin the park. Competing on price is rarely a good idea. Differentiating from\nyour competition, on the other hand, can facilitate your solution\u2019s growth\ntrajectory.\n\nAdding value always helps in retaining current and attracting new customers.\nAnd when it comes to children, there\u2019s nothing more important than safety and\nsecurity.
