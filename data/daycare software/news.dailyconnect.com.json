There are many software programs that daycare centers can use to\nhelp complete all the tasks that they need to carry out every day. Exactly\nwhich childcare software is best might be different for each childcare\nbusiness: every childcare center is unique, and has its own set of needs. If\nyou\u2019re wondering which platform to use, keep reading.\n\n## Why Upgrade to a New Childcare Software?\n\nBefore you go on the search for all the childcare software programs available,\nask yourself: what is the number one thing you want to improve at your\nbusiness? Maybe it\u2019s parent billing or staff communication; maybe it\u2019s\ncurriculum planning  or managing your finances. Whatever the reason, setting\nup some kind of software is the answer. Here\u2019s a few key reasons to upgrade to\na new childcare software platform:\n\n### Better Parent Communication\n\nUsing software that allows digital communication helps to keep parents and\nteachers informed. Instead of missed phone calls or lost notes, a quick direct\nmessage can be sent securely between families and childcare staff, making sure\neveryone is aware of any important information about a child.\n\n### Easier Attendance Tracking\n\nA childcare software lets teachers and staff easily view the attendance of\ntheir classrooms. Whenever a parent checks their child in or out, the status\nupdates live on the computer, app, or tablet. That makes it easy for\nmanagement to see how many children are in each classroom, ensuring they stick\nto regulated teacher to child ratios. Software like this also logs the exact\nsign in and sign out timestamp automatically, which is essential for\ndocumentation purposes.\n\n### Administrative Task Automation\n\nComprehensive childcare apps can help the team manage projects and keep track\nof recurring administrative tasks. For example, custom cleaning schedules can\nbe set to appear in the software so every staff member knows his or her\nresponsibilities for the week.\n\n### Payments and Accounting\n\nA childcare payment platform lets legal guardians make instant payments online\nusing their credit card or bank account. Childcare providers can charge\npayments and late fees, send automatic reminders for upcoming bills, and keep\ntrack of bookkeeping throughout the year.\n\n### Aligned Learning Outcomes\n\nDigital software can show leaders how students are learning and whether or not\nthey\u2019re meeting developmental milestones. Child assessments, routine testing,\nand individual reports can be recorded and viewed easily in the software.\n\nThere are many other benefits of using a childcare management platform. Below\nwe\u2019ll explore some of them individually.\n\n## Top 10 Childcare Software Solutions for Running a Daycare\n\nWhether you need an all-inclusive daycare app or simply a new payment method\nfor your website, here are ten of the most easy-to-use solutions for your\ndaycare business.\n\n### 1\\.
