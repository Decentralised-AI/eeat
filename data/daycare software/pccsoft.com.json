You\u2019ll have\ncomprehensive point-of-sale convenience built specifically for your business\n\n### For instance, we know drop-in centers and preschool centers that offer\ndrop-in services require flexible billing options. So Prime can be easily\ncustomized to allow you to bill your customers the way you already do but with\nmuch less administrative effort and cost. In fact, our customers enjoy billing\nautomation for lots of things, like hourly billing, sibling discounts, early\ndrop-off and late pickup fees.\n\nWe also understand that your customers need to register and pay easily at\ncheck-in and check-out. So we enable them to register quickly in the check-in\napp. The app also lets them pay quickly when they check-out their child.\n\nCenters that offer both traditional and drop-in childcare face unique\nchallenges that most systems can\u2019t solve. But Prime is designed to meet the\nneeds of such centers, too. For example, our solution can automatically\nprovide billing and check-in options that are specific to your needs.\n\n### Registration and enrollment that saves time, paper, and money\n\nAs you know all too well, registration/enrollment is one of your most time-\nconsuming and paper-intensive tasks.
