I believe the app will be beneficial to the\nchildcare provider community.  \n  \nI have a 5 month old in daycare currently. I am a web designer and about a\nmonth ago my provider asked me if I could design her a web app for managing\nher daycare center. I don't yet have all of the details of what the app will\nprovide, but that's what I need you all for.  \n  \nI am in the early stages of development and need feedback from the daycare\nprovider community in regard to what makes a good childcare management\nsoftware and what your needs are. Specifically, my goal is to produce a\nsoftware package that will meet all of the needs of in-home daycare businesses\nand make it easier to manage the business aspect of daycare. Minimizing time\nspent on managing the business will hopefully allow providers to focus more on\nthe children.  \n  \nAs a parent, anything that I can do to help my provider so she can maximize\ntime spent on childcare rather than business management, only helps put my\nmind at ease when entrusting my child with someone else.  \n  \nIf anyone is interested in supporting me in this effort, I have included a\nlink to an online survey that will help me build the app that meets YOUR needs\n(assuming you are a childcare provider). The survey should take 20-30 minutes.\nThe more detail your provide, the more helpful it will be.  \n  \nThanks,  \n  \nDeric  \n\nReply\n\nBlackcat31 01:05 PM 06-18-2018\n\n_Originally Posted by **Deric Albright** :  \nHello Everyone,  \n  \nI am new to this thread and seeking some assistance with a web application\nthat I am working to build.
