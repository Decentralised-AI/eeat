I believe the app will be beneficial to the\nchildcare provider community.  \n  \nI have a 5 month old in daycare currently. I am a web designer and about a\nmonth ago my provider asked me if I could design her a web app for managing\nher daycare center. I don't yet have all of the details of what the app will\nprovide, but that's what I need you all for.  \n  \nI am in the early stages of development and need feedback from the daycare\nprovider community in regard to what makes a good childcare management\nsoftware and what your needs are. Specifically, my goal is to produce a\nsoftware package that will meet all of the needs of in-home daycare businesses\nand make it easier to manage the business aspect of daycare. Minimizing time\nspent on managing the business will hopefully allow providers to focus more on\nthe children.  \n  \nAs a parent, anything that I can do to help my provider so she can maximize\ntime spent on childcare rather than business management, only helps put my\nmind at ease when entrusting my child with someone else.  \n  \nIf anyone is interested in supporting me in this effort, I have included a\nlink to an online survey that will help me build the app that meets YOUR needs\n(assuming you are a childcare provider). The survey should take 20-30 minutes.\nThe more detail your provide, the more helpful it will be.  \n  \nThanks,  \n  \nDeric  \n\nReply\n\nBlackcat31 01:05 PM 06-18-2018\n\n_Originally Posted by **Deric Albright** :  \nHello Everyone,  \n  \nI am new to this thread and seeking some assistance with a web application\nthat I am working to build.

But if the parents do, just manage it matter-of-\nfactly and say something like _\"Yep, just like everything else in life the\ncosts go up every year.\"_ and then move along like it is no big deal. Because\nit really isn't.  \n  \nBlackcat31  \n---  \nView Public Profile  \nFind all posts by Blackcat31  \n  \n  # **8**  \n\n09-13-2018, 09:34 AM  \n  \n---  \n|  |\n\nhwichlaz\n\nDaycare.com Member\n\n|   |\n\nJoin Date: May 2013\n\nLocation: California\n\nPosts: 2,050  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n* * *\n\nI don\u2019t discount parents when their kids hit the new age bracket either.

They started with\nme 5 years ago. Last year I decided to require all kids who are here during\nthe day (not after school kids) to come in the summer. This DCM was upset\nbecause the reason they came to me was because \"I didn't require summer care\".  \n  \nIf they have another baby in a year or two, does she expect me to stick to all\nof my original \"rules\". By the time that youngest child goes to school, they\nwill be with me for 10+ years.  \n  \nI'm impressed that you all don't change rates for current families. When my\nrate changes, it changes for everyone.  \n  \ngumdrops  \n---  \nView Public Profile  \nFind all posts by gumdrops  \n  \n---  \n  \nTags  \n---  \nprice increase, tuition, tuition - pricing  \n  \n\n**\u00ab** Previous Thread | Next Thread **\u00bb**\n\nThread Tools  \n---  \n  \nShow Printable Version\n\nEmail this Page  \n  \nDisplay Modes  \n  \n**Linear Mode**\n\nSwitch to Hybrid Mode\n\nSwitch to Threaded Mode  \n  \n  \n|  Posting Rules  \n---  \n  \nYou **may not** post new threads\n\nYou **may not** post replies\n\nYou **may not** post attachments\n\nYou **may not** edit your posts\n\n* * *\n\nBB code is **On**\n\nSmilies are **On**\n\n[IMG] code is **On**\n\nHTML code is **Off**\n\n* * *\n\nForum Rules  \n  \n|\n\n**Forum Jump**  \nUser Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums\nForums Home Main Category     Daycare Center and Family Home Forum\nPrivate - Members Only - By Invitation Daycare and Taxes Forms - Uploads Book\nClub - Reviews / Suggestions Daycare Menus, Breakfast, Lunch and Snack Ideas\nParents and Guardians Forum Daycare Insurance New Members - Welcome to the\nDaycare.com Forum!
