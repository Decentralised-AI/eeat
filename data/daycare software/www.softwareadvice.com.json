Even after administrators have met\nlicensing requirements, determined a legal structure, found the perfect\nlocation and hired staff, they still have to handle a variety of daily tasks\nto keep kids (and their parents) happy.\n\nChild care software helps users manage the day-to-day aspects of running a\ndaycare center or preschool. Among other things, these systems can automate\nadministrative tasks, keep attendance records, store parents\u2019 contact\ninformation, track children\u2019s health data and help users schedule classes and\nappointments.\n\nThis guide can help potential buyers find the best solution for their needs.\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover:\n\nWhat Is Child Care Software?\n\nCommon Functionality of Child Care Software\n\nBenefits of Child Care Management Software\n\nPricing: Web-Based vs. On-Premise\n\nIndustry Trends\n\n## What Is Child Care Software?\n\nChild care professionals are busy, and it can be difficult for them to not\nonly keep up with their young charges, but stay on top of administrative,\nscheduling and financial duties, as well. That\u2019s where child care management\nsoftware comes in: It helps child care workers simplify and streamline the\nmanual processes they do every day, including recordkeeping, billing,\nattendance and immunization tracking.\n\nChild care management software is also known as \u201cchild care administrative\nsoftware\u201d or \u201cdaycare management software.\u201d The technology is useful for all\nkinds of child care centers, including:\n\n  * Day-care centers\n\n  * Licensed family child care homes\n\n  * Early childhood education programs/preschools\n\n  * After-school programs\n\n  * Drop-in programs\n\nOnce an organization is ready to open its doors to potential clients, it\u2019s\nnever too early to invest in a software system. Doing so can ensure they\u2019re\norganized from the start and set up for success.\n\nFor example, some center administrators think a single-application software,\nsuch as an accounting program from an industry-agnostic vendor, will be enough\nto fulfill their needs. However, that isn\u2019t ideal for long-term growth. It\u2019s\nusually better to get a dedicated child care management solution because it\nlets you streamline every aspect of the business, eliminating the need to buy\ndifferent applications from multiple vendors that don\u2019t interface with one\nanother.\n\n## Common Functionality of Child Care Management Software\n\nMost child care management systems will come with some or all of the following\ncapabilities:\n\n **Admissions and scheduling**\n\n|\n\nProvides widgets and calendars for scheduling classes as well as enrollment\nand registration.  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n **Billing and payments**\n\n|\n\nAllows users to perform billing and invoicing, track account balances and\npast-due payments, create and print payment reports and statements and post\npayment in batches. Offers support for multiple online and in-person payment\nmethods, including cash, check, money order and credit cards.  \n  \n **Immunization tracking**\n\n|\n\nTracks and stores children\u2019s immunization records, including past, current and\ncompleted vaccinations and immunization due dates.  \n  \n **Reporting**\n\n|\n\nGenerates reports of and provides alerts for children\u2019s birthdays. Also\ncreates reports on revenue summaries, class statistics (e.g., class type and\nsize), attendance and financial transactions.  \n  \n **Employee management/time and attendance**\n\n|\n\nFacilitates staff check-in and check-out; manages employee hours; stores pay\nrates and other staffing information at organization-wide and location-\nspecific levels.  \n  \n **Communication**\n\n|\n\nAllows users to keep parents informed about their child\u2019s activities via\nmobile application alerts, emails or text messages.  \n  \n **Meal management**\n\n|\n\nSome systems offer menu planning, meal tracking and nutrition analysis\nfunctionality.  \n  \n **Activity planning**\n\n|\n\nEnables staff to create lesson plans or activity plans in advance.  \n  \n## Benefits of Child Care Management Software\n\nDaycare and preschool facilities can realize many benefits as a result of\nadopting child care management software, including:\n\n **Less administrative work.** Generally, staff in a daycare or preschool\nfacility handles both administrative and physical child care duties. This\nsoftware automates administrative tasks, such as online registration, so\nemployees can focus their energy on the children themselves.\n\n **Improved communication with parents.** Working parents don\u2019t need to worry\nor inquire about their children. With child care management software, your\nfacility can send parents notifications about their child throughout the day\nvia native mobile apps or text messaging.\n\n **Advanced meal and nutrition planning.** Some vendors offer tools for\ntracking the number of provided meals, as well as for planning breakfast,\nlunch and snacks based on the nutritional requirements of each child. With\nthis functionality, child care centers can give growing kids the nourishment\nthey need.\n\n **Greater staff coordination.** As opposed to paper-based records, digital\nsystems are accessible to multiple users in separate locations. This makes it\neasier for employees to update any necessary documentation and for the\nbusiness to scale.\n\n## Pricing: Cloud-Based vs. On-Premise\n\nThere are two main pricing models prevalent in this market. Select the one\nthat best fits your budget and business model:\n\nCloud-based **software.** These solutions are typically priced on a monthly or\nan annual subscription basis. They require low or no upfront investment, and\nvendors handle system maintenance and updates. This option is often best for\nsmall and midsize businesses that may not have the resources to invest in and\nmanage an on-premise system.\n\n **On-premise software.** These systems typically require purchasing a\nperpetual license for a substantial upfront fee. There are no recurring\nlicense fees, but extra fees may apply for implementation assistance,\nmaintenance, support and updates.\n\nNo matter which system you choose, over a period of time, pricing for these\ntwo models tends to converge.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\n **Mobile device integration.** Systems are starting to introduce native apps\nfor mobile devices that can be used for administrative purposes or to connect\nwith parents. For example, some apps may allow you to track child arrivals and\ndepartures by asking parents to check in and out of your center with a tablet\nplaced near the entrance. On the other hand, some apps are meant to be\ndownloaded by parents and can be used as a platform to exchange pictures and\nmessages about their children with your staff.\n\n **Staff training and development.** If you want to attract and retain great\nemployees, you may want to consider offering them professional development\nopportunities, such as enrolling them in online child care courses. Software\ncan help you keep track of which staff members have completed training\nprograms and received certifications.\n\n  * About Us\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Vendors\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * View All Categories\n\n  * \u00a9 2006-2024 Software Advice, Inc.\n\n  * User Terms\n\n  * Vendor Terms\n\n  * Community Guidelines\n\n  * Content Policy\n\n  * Content Policy FAQs\n\n  * Cookie Policy\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Data Protection Agreement\n\n",
