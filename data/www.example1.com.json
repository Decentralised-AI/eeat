L.\n         exemplum, orig., what is taken out of a larger quantity, as a\n         sample, from eximere to take out. See Exempt, and cf.\n         Ensample, Sample.]\n         1. One or a portion taken to show the character or quality of\n            the whole; a sample; a specimen.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n         2. That which is to be followed or imitated as a model; a\n            pattern or copy.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n                  For I have given you an example, that ye should do\n                  as I have done to you.                --John xiii.\n                                                        15.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n                  I gave, thou sayest, the example; I led the way.\n                                                        --Milton.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n         3. That which resembles or corresponds with something else; a\n            precedent; a model.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n                  Such temperate order in so fierce a cause\n                  Doth want example.                    --Shak.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n         4. That which is to be avoided; one selected for punishment\n            and to serve as a warning; a warning.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n                  Hang him; he'll be made an example.   --Shak.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n                  Now these things were our examples, to the intent\n                  that we should not lust after evil things, as they\n                  also lusted.                          --1 Cor. x. 6.\n            [1913 Webster]\n      \n         5. An instance serving for illustration of a rule or precept,\n            especially a problem to be solved, or a case to be\n            determined, as an exercise in the application of the rules\n            of any study or branch of science; as, in trigonometry and\n            grammar, the principles and rules are illustrated by\n            examples.\n      \n         Syn: Precedent; case; instance.\n      \n         Usage: Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made\n                between these two words relates to cases in which we\n                give \"instances\" or \"examples\" of things done. An\n                instance denotes the single case then \"standing\"\n                before us; if there be others like it, the word does\n                not express this fact. On the contrary, an example is\n                one of an entire class of like things, and should be a\n                true representative or sample of that class. Hence, an\n                example proves a rule or regular course of things; an\n                instance simply points out what may be true only in\n                the case presented. A man's life may be filled up with\n                examples of the self-command and kindness which marked\n                his character, and may present only a solitary\n                instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word\n                \"example\" should never be used to describe what stands\n                singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes apply the\n                word instance to what is really an example, because we\n                are not thinking of the latter under this aspect, but\n                solely as a case which \"stands before us.\" See\n                Precedent.\n                [1913 Webster]\n    \n    \n    From The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 : \n    \n      Example \\Ex*am\"ple\\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Exampled; p. pr. &\n         vb. n. Exampling.]\n         To set an example for; to give a precedent for; to exemplify;\n         to give an instance of; to instance. [Obs.] \"I may example my\n         digression by some mighty precedent.\" --Shak.\n         [1913 Webster]\n      \n              Burke devoted himself to this duty with a fervid\n               assiduity that has not often been exampled, and has\n               never been surpassed.                    --J. Morley.\n         [1913 Webster]\n    \n    \n    \n    From WordNet (r) 2.0 : \n    \n      example\n           n 1: an item of information that is representative of a type;\n                \"this patient provides a typical example of the\n                syndrome\"; \"there is an example on page 10\" [syn: illustration,\n                 instance, representative]\n           2: a representative form or pattern; \"I profited from his\n              example\" [syn: model]\n           3: something to be imitated; \"an exemplar of success\"; \"a model\n              of clarity\"; \"he is the very model of a modern major\n              general\" [syn: exemplar, model, good example]\n           4: punishment intended as a warning to others; \"they decided to\n              make an example of him\" [syn: deterrent example, lesson,\n               object lesson]\n           5: an occurrence of something; \"it was a case of bad judgment\";\n              \"another instance occurred yesterday\"; \"but there is\n              always the famous example of the Smiths\" [syn: case, instance]\n           6: a task performed or problem solved in order to develop skill\n              or understanding; \"you must work the examples at the end\n              of each chapter in the textbook\" [syn: exercise]\n    \t\n    \tSample Usage: Examples of actresses I like: Julia Roberts,\n    \tSandra Bullock\n    \n    \n\n  \nExample1 HOSTGATOR\n\n",
