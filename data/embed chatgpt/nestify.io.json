This means you can seamlessly\ntransfer conversations to human agents when necessary, providing a smooth and\nefficient customer support experience.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using ChatGPT is the ability to set up keyword\nintents that trigger escalation to human agents. By defining specific phrases\nor triggers, you can ensure that complex or sensitive inquiries are promptly\nhandled by your support team, improving customer satisfaction and response\ntimes. Furthermore, you can actively monitor ongoing chats, allowing your\ncompany to engage with website visitors at the most appropriate moment,\nensuring a timely and effective response.\n\nHere are some of the capabilities you can leverage with your embedded ChatGPT\nchatbot:\n\n  * Pre-qualify leads: Utilize the chatbot to gather information from potential customers, helping you identify qualified leads.\n  * Choose your ChatGPT model: Stay up to date with the latest advancements by selecting the desired ChatGPT model for your chatbot.

Add your OpenAI API Key to Social Intents: Configure your Social Intents chatbot settings by incorporating your OpenAI API Key, enabling seamless communication between Social Intents and ChatGPT.\n\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll be well on your way to enhancing your\nwebsite\u2019s user experience with the powerful features of ChatGPT.\n\n## 1\\. **Create a Live Chat widget in Social Intents**\n\n  * Register for a 14-Day Free Trial: If you don\u2019t already have an account with Social Intents, head over to their website and sign up for a free trial. This trial period will allow you to explore and evaluate the features and benefits of their platform.\n  * Choose an Integration: Once you\u2019ve signed up, you\u2019ll be prompted to select an integration option.

With these integrations, you\u2019ll have the flexibility to answer chats within the chosen platform, such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Webex, or directly in Social Intents\u2019 web-based dashboard.\n  * Set up Live Chat Agents: Depending on your chosen integration, you\u2019ll need to configure and add Live Chat agents to the respective platform (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.). These agents will be responsible for handling escalated chats from the chatbot, ensuring a seamless transition from automated responses to personalized human support.\n  * Create a Live Chat Widget: Within your Social Intents account, navigate to the Live Chat settings and create a new widget. This widget will represent the chat interface that will be embedded on your website, enabling visitors to interact with the ChatGPT bot.\n  * Generate Code Snippet: Once you\u2019ve set up your Live Chat widget, Social Intents will provide you with a code snippet. This snippet contains the necessary code to integrate the ChatGPT chatbot into your website. Copy the code snippet and proceed to the next step.\n  * Embed the Code Snippet on Your Website: Access the source code of your website and locate the section where you want to place the chatbot. Paste the code snippet provided by Social Intents into that section of your website\u2019s code. This will enable the chatbot functionality and allow visitors to engage with ChatGPT directly on your site.\n\n## 2\\. **Create your OpenAI account**\n\nBefore proceeding with the integration of ChatGPT into Social Intents, ensure\nthat you have an OpenAI account.

If you don\u2019t have an existing API key, click on the \u201cCreate new API key\u201d or similar button to generate a new key.\n  * Copy your API key: After creating a new API key, you will be provided with the key itself. Copy the API key as you will need it for the next step.\n\nNow that you have your OpenAI API key, proceed with the integration steps in\nSocial Intents:\n\nAccess your Social Intents account: Log in to your Social Intents account\nusing your credentials. Navigate to Chatbot Settings: Within your Social\nIntents account, locate the Chatbot Settings or Integration Settings section.\nThis is where you can configure the integration with external services.\n\n  * Configure OpenAI integration: Look for the OpenAI integration settings within the Chatbot Settings. This is where you will need to input your OpenAI API key.\n  * Enter your OpenAI API key: Paste the API key you obtained from OpenAI into the designated field within the Social Intents Chatbot Settings. Make sure to save your changes to apply the integration.\n\n#### **3\\. Add your OpenAI API Key to Social Intents**\n\nOnce you have successfully created a Live Chat app in Social Intents, follow\nthese steps to configure the Chatbot Settings:\n\n  1. Access Chat Settings: In your Social Intents account, navigate to the Chat Settings by clicking on \u201cMy Apps\u201d and then selecting \u201cEdit Settings\u201d for your desired chat widget.\n  2. Open Chatbot Settings: Within the Chat Settings, locate the \u201cChatbot Settings\u201d tab and click on it to access the configuration options for your chatbot.\n  3. Name and Avatar: In the Chatbot Settings, give your chatbot a name that represents its identity. You can also choose an avatar or image to visually represent the chatbot during conversations.\n  4. Select Chatbot Type: Choose the Chatbot Type as \u201cChatGPT with OpenAI\u201d from the available options. This ensures that your chatbot is powered by ChatGPT technology using the OpenAI platform.\n  5. Determine Chatbot Invitation Behavior: Decide how you want the chatbot to be invited into conversations. You have three options: a. Chatbot Only: The chatbot handles conversations without involving live chat agents. b. Chatbot Pick Up When Agents Are Offline or Miss a Chat: The chatbot takes over when your live chat agents are unavailable or fail to respond. c. Chatbot Joins When Agents Join: The chatbot joins the conversation simultaneously when live chat agents are present.\n  6. Choose the ChatGPT Model: OpenAI supports various models for the Chat API. You can refer to the OpenAI documentation at https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat to explore the available options. For now, select the current chat model: \u201cgpt-3.5-turbo.\u201d\n  7. Enter your OpenAI API Key: Copy your OpenAI API Key, which you obtained earlier, and paste it into the field labeled \u201cChatGPT API Key\u201d within the Chatbot Settings. This key establishes the connection between Social Intents and the OpenAI platform.\n\n After configuring the basic settings for your ChatGPT chatbot in Social\nIntents, you can further customize its behavior and interaction with users\nusing the following features:\n\n  1. Customizing Welcome Text: Personalize the initial interaction by setting a Default Welcome Response. This message will be displayed when users initiate a conversation with the chatbot. Additionally, you can include Quick Reply buttons to provide users with predefined options to guide them through the conversation.\n  2. Human Escalation Trigger Phrases: Define specific phrases or keywords that indicate a user\u2019s intent to connect with a live agent. When one of these trigger phrases is matched, Social Intents automatically sends Live Chat Invites to your human agents in platforms like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, or Webex. This ensures a smooth transition from the chatbot to human assistance. Once your agents respond and take over the conversation, the chatbot will no longer be actively involved.\n  3. Customizing Instruction Phrases: Adjust the ChatGPT Instruction Phrases to align with your specific website and desired outcomes. By including relevant keywords or phrases that point to your website URLs, you can guide ChatGPT to provide more accurate and helpful responses to user queries.\n\nBy leveraging these customization options, you can enhance the user experience\nand optimize the effectiveness of your ChatGPT chatbot within Social Intents.\nRemember to tailor the welcome text, trigger phrases, and instruction phrases\nto align with your business objectives and the specific needs of your website\nvisitors.\n\n**4\\. Train your ChatGPT Chatbot with your Website Content**\n\nTraining your ChatGPT chatbot involves two essential steps. Let\u2019s explore each\nstep in detail:\n\n  1. Utilizing Instruction Phrases: In the chatbot settings, you can leverage Instruction Phrases to send an initial System message when starting a chat. This system message provides important context to the ChatGPT bot. It allows you to convey the desired tone, specify the types of answers you expect from the bot, and provide guidance on where to direct visitors. By using Instruction Phrases, you can enhance the chatbot\u2019s understanding and align its responses with your specific requirements.\n  2. Training ChatGPT with Your Own Content: The exciting part is that you can train ChatGPT with your own content easily. Within the chatbot settings, click on the \u201cTrain your chatbot\u201d button. This will take you to a dedicated page where you can list URLs that contain the content you want to use for training. You can enter a base domain or individual URLs that host the relevant information. Once you\u2019ve specified the content sources, click on \u201cTrain All\u201d to initiate the training process.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a ChatGPT chatbot that is trained on\nyour own website content and knowledge base articles. This personalized\ntraining empowers the chatbot to provide more accurate and relevant responses\nto user queries, based on the specific information and knowledge you have\nprovided. It enhances the effectiveness of the chatbot and ensures a more\ntailored conversational experience for your website visitors.\n\n**5.  Copy your Live Chat Code Snippet to your Website**\n\nTo enable the ChatGPT chat functionality on your website, simply copy the Live\nChat code snippet provided by Social Intents and add it to your website\u2019s HTML\ntemplate. Follow these steps:\n\n  1. Copy the Live Chat code snippet: Locate the Live Chat code snippet that Social Intents generated for you during the setup process.\n  2. Access your HTML template: Open the HTML template file of your website in a text editor or HTML editor.\n  3. Paste the code snippet: Find the appropriate section within your HTML template where you want to place the chat functionality. It could be in the footer, sidebar, or a dedicated chat section. Paste the copied code snippet into that section of your HTML template.\n  4. Save and deploy changes: Save the changes to your HTML template and deploy the updated website to make the ChatGPT chatbot functional on your site.\n\n**6.  That\u2019s it!  Your ChatGPT Chatbot is added on your website!**\n\nCongratulations! Your website\u2019s chatbot, powered by ChatGPT, is now fully\nenabled and ready to assist your visitors with their questions.\n\nIf you encounter any errors during the implementation process, ensure that you\nhave added your billing information to your OpenAI account.
