Compression leggings and\nsweat enhancing activewear provide numerous benefits that can help you on your\njourney to lose weight, improve your physique, and achieve a healthier\nlifestyle in general.\n\n## What are compressions leggings?\n\nLycra leggings are a thing of the past. Compression leggings and clothes, in\ngeneral, are the next level of active sportswear that improves athletic\nperformance, shapes the body, improves blood flow, and increases sweating.\n\nCompression leggings, similar to spandex leggings, are made of an elastic and\nstretchy blend of materials that perfectly hugs and shapes your body and\nmuscles while at the same time \u201ccompresses\u201d and adds pressure to the targeted\nareas (butt, thighs).\n\nIn doing so, your body is complimented with a slimmer shape instantly the\nmoment you wear them, and problematic areas that contain fatty tissue are\n\u201ctucked in\u201d and hidden. Additionally, the function of the fabric helps with\nmuscle fatigue, muscle recovery, and enhanced sweating.\n\n**Shop our range of  ** **compression leggings for women** **  and compression\n** **tank tops for men** **.**\n\n## **How do compressions leggings work?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, sweat enhancing compression wear is made up of a unique\nblend of stretchy and elastic fabrics that add pressure to the body and seal\noff the heat, increasing your sweat rate.  \n  \nDue to their compression feature, the muscles are held together tight, which\nreduces the chances of muscle injury as it increases the body temperature and\nkeeps the muscles warm.  \n  \nAdditionally, its elastic and compression fabric shape your body following\nyour natural curves. It makes you look slimmer and more athletic as common\nproblem areas that carry more fatty tissue like the waist, hips, butt, and\nthighs are compressed and reduced in size, discreetly shaping them.\n\n## **What is the difference between compressions tights and leggings?**\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s the difference between compressions leggings and\ntights, then you\u2019re not alone.  \n  \nThe differences mainly come down to the type of fabric used. Usually, non-\ncompression tights and leggings utilize sheer materials (similar to\npantyhose). Additionally, they are also heavier and used as a substitute for\nyoga pants.  \n  \nSomething to note is that leggings and tights, in general, come in different\nshapes, sizes, and styles \u2014 full coverage, footless, with or without a bell\nbottom, etc.  \n  \nIn terms of materials used, compressions leggings are usually made up of a\nblend of lycra, polyester, and other fabrics. Our range of compression\ngarments is made from a lightweight, neoprene free, polymer fabric which is\nsuperior to neoprene-based clothes which are a known cause of skin problems\nand allergic reactions.  \n  \nCompression leggings and tights are also worn as a fashion statement, but at\nthe same time, they also offer medical and performance-enhancer benefits.\n\n## **6 benefits of compression clothing**\n\nWhether you are a professional athlete or someone who simply wants to take\nadvantage of the benefits of compression activewear to improve their physique,\nreach your fitness and weight loss goals, or anything in between, you\u2019ll enjoy\nthe many benefits of compression leggings and garments have to offer.\n\n### **1\\. Reduce muscle soreness and fatigue**\n\nCompression clothes help increase your sports performance by reducing muscle\nfatigue and soreness. The compression feature \u201crelaxes\u201d and alleviates the\npressure and strain put on your muscles when you work out or experience\nincreased physical activity. Their effect works before, during, and after a\nworkout.\n\n### **2\\. Improved muscle oxygenation**\n\nWhen you experience increased physical activity, your muscles need oxygen to\nfunction correctly and to reach their full potential. Compression leggings\nimprove the oxygenation of muscle tissue as they promote blood flow.\n\n### **3\\. Increases blood flow**\n\nDue to their compression ability and special elastic fabric utilization, the\ncompression leggings promote blood flow, which means that more oxygen and\nnutrients are delivered to the muscles faster.\n\n### **4\\. Increases sweating**\n\nThe blend of fabrics is specially selected to increase the body temperature,\nseal the heat inside, and increase sweating. As you sweat more, you shed water\nweight faster for a sauna-like experience.\n\n### **5\\. Speeds up recovery**\n\nWhen wearing compression garments, it helps speed up rebuilding the muscles\nafter intense workouts and physical activity. Due to the tightness of the\ngarments and the increased temperature, your muscles will recover faster as\nmore blood passes through, and the swelling will go away quicker.\n\n### **6\\. Instantly makes you look slimmer**\n\nA confidence boost is sometimes the one thing we need to help us stick to our\nplan and reach our goals. It\u2019s not uncommon to take your first steps to\nimprove your lifestyle through a healthier diet and a more active workout\nroutine that you may feel vulnerable and unprepared to step into the gym.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s alright, and it\u2019s quite common; that\u2019s where compression garments come\nin! They can give you an extra boost in confidence to take the next step to\nstart your lifestyle changing journey.\n\n  \nCompression clothing is specifically designed to tuck in problematic areas of\nyour body like your belly, butt, thighs, and waist and give it a natural-\nlooking athletic shape. This isn\u2019t just a confidence boost, but it helps you\nvisualize your future self.\n\n* * *\n\n\u2190 Older Post Newer Post \u2192\n\n### Recent Articles\n\n10 Tips to Relieve Lower Back Pain  \n_November 09, 2020_\n\n5 Tips & Exercises for Good Posture  \n_November 02, 2020_\n\nThe 10 Best Heart-healthy Foods to Include in your Diet  \n_October 06, 2020_\n\n4 Key Health Goals to Set That Have Nothing to Do With Losing Weight  \n_October 01, 2020_\n\nHow to Find the Best Workout Clothes for Me?  \n_September 06, 2020_\n\n7 Tips to Get Workout Motivation  \n_September 01, 2020_\n\n  * HOW IT WORKS\n  * SIZING\n  * FAQ\n  * RETURNS & EXCHANGES \n  * CONTACT US\n  * BLOG\n  * SHIPPING POLICY\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  * ACCESSIBILITY\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Pinterest\n  * YouTube\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sweat Shaper\u2122\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nPayment icons\n\n  * American Express\n  * Apple Pay\n  * Discover\n  * Meta Pay\n  * Google Pay\n  * Mastercard\n  * PayPal\n  * Shop Pay\n  * Venmo\n  * Visa\n  * \n\nHEY, LET'S STAY CONNECTED\n\nSIGN UP\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to receive marketing text messages (e.g.\ncart reminders) from Sweat Shaper at the number provided.
