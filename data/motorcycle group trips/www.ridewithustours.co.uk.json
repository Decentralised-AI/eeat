With this in mind, we pay special attention to providing the right\nbalance between riding the best roads and allowing enough time to explore and\nexperience each region. This includes visits to the main tourist attractions,\nnational parks, museums, monuments, local farms and vineyards or even boat and\ntrain day trips.\n\nPlease visit our Facebook page for up-to-date information regarding RideWithUs\nmotorcycle tours and holidays.\n\n#### Channel Crossing\n\nWe predominantly use the Eurotunnel to cross the Channel for our guided\nmotorcycle tours and holidays. This eliminates any potential complaints of\nseasickness, makes boarding and disembarkation much quicker, and the crossing\nis not affected by adverse weather conditions. Another important factor is\nflexibility. On the return leg of our motorcycle tours and holidays, if we\narrive back to the check-in area at Calais before our scheduled departure\ntime, there is always a realistic possibility of boarding the first available\ntrain. With its own motorway junction (11a M20), access to the Passenger\nTerminal couldn\u2019t be simpler. Prior to boarding the shuttles, you will pass\nthrough both UK and French frontier controls, which means on arrival in\nFrance, you simply drive off the shuttle onto the European motorway network.\n\n#### Hotels\n\nAs we specialise in organising motorcycle tours and holidays for smaller\ngroups (12 bikes max.) and individuals, we have more choice in selecting the\ntypes of accommodation we use. We usually opt for family-run hotels where the\nowners extend a genuine welcome to motorcyclists. They are often situated in\nrural out-of-town locations, offer excellent customer service, and provide a\nhomely ambience. However, pending on tour, we also use good quality elegant\ntown hotels that are conveniently located near the city centres and tourist\nattractions. Our chosen hotels are mainly four-star with secure motorcycle\nparking.\n\n#### Food\n\nAuthentic experience is a big part of any holiday, and guided motorcycle tours\nand holidays are no exception. Each region we visit on our tours offers its\nown unique selection of historical, cultural and social aspects. And often,\nthe best way to experience all of these aspects together is through the local\ncuisine. Wherever we stay on our motorcycle tours and holidays, we make it our\npriority to include the local guest houses, restaurants, taverns and eateries\nthat serve traditional home-made specialities.\n\n#### About us\n\nRideWithUs motorcycle tours and holidays was formed by Slavica and Petar and\nhas been in business since 2002. We have extensive knowledge of Europe,\nespecially the Alpine, Central and Eastern European regions. We fluently speak\nEnglish, Hungarian, Serbian and Croatian.
