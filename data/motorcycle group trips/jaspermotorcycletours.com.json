We had fun dressing up in the leathers and\nheaded out on a beautiful crisp sunny morning, waving to everybody we went. It\nwas great to sight see with the wind in your face smelling the pine trees. We\nheaded out to Maligne lake and canyon. It was so comfortable with heated vests\nand my partner found the side car was brilliant for using the gopro and\ncomfortable even for his 6 foot, on the wide side frame. Great fun and a great\ntime.\n\n\u2013 MarkandSal39, TripAdvisor\n\nAmazing Tour!\n\nBeen there with my husband during our honeymoon in Alberta.
