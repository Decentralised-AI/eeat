Riding a motorcycle through the U.S. is\nthe epitome of freedom, life and rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\n\n### Classic No.1: USA Motorcycle Tours along Route 66\n\nRiding the most legendary route in the traditional direction on a motorcycle\nfrom east to west is the dream of many bikers, and rightly so - even if the\noriginall Route 66 no longer exists in its entirety. Nevertheless, endlessly\nlong highways, cosy biker bars and typical American burger restaurants next to\nthe big cities and national parks are the highlights of such a trip.  \n  \nThe best time to travel through the USA on a motorcycle tour are May, August\nand September. Since the route from Chicago to Santa Monica crosses different\nterritories and has to cope with different altitudes, you can expect weather\nfluctuations. You should be aware of this when packing your bike bags.  \n  \nYou can choose between guided motorcycle group tours with a tour guide,\noftentimes with an accompanying vehicle for luggage transport, which usually\ntake place on fixed dates, or tours for self-guided riders who want to start a\nfully organised tour on their own with their own or a rental motorcycle, pre-\nbooked hotels and route plan.  \n  \nYou travel to Chicago and spend the first night in a hotel so that you can\nstart your motorcycle trip the next day rested. The following day you can take\nover your motorcycle at the rental station in the morning and start your dream\nvacation.  \n  \nYou pass the \"Gateway to the West\", the pioneer city St. Louis. You look at\nthe over 600 feet high Gateway Arch, the landmark of the city, a steel arch,\ninside which gondolas take you to the top and a wonderful view of the city.\nLater, the Route 66 takes you through Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma, heading\nfor Amarillo.  \n  \nA relic of the highway\u2019s heyday awaits you here: the Cadillac Ranch. You know\nthe ten vehicles that were driven vertically into the ground as a fantastic\nphoto motif. You\u2019ll rest your motorcycle at Adrian, the geo-mathematical\ncentre of the old route, where you\u2019ll find a place for lunch and an\ninteresting car museum.  \n  \nYou ride your bike through Santa Fe, through Gallup and through Navajo Land to\nChinle. Along the way you\u2019ll encounter not only endless wideness, but also the\nFour Corners, the only point in America where four states border each other:\nArizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. On your motorcycle tour you\u2019ll visit\nthe petrified forest and the natural wonder of the Painted Desert - both of\nwhich were created out of a whim of nature and show a spectacular play of\ncolors through different shades of light.  \n  \n\n  *   *   * \n\nFurther west you reach Flagstaff between the Navajo and Hopi Indian\nreservations and are already approaching one of the greatest highlights of\nyour motorcycle tour: the Grand Canyon. It\u2019s hard to find anything more\ngigantic and impressive in this world.  \n  \nOnwards with your motorcycle via Williams to Seligman, where the historic\nroute leads to Santa Monica. On this part of the route you can still ride the\noriginal route, which you can find out about in Seligman in the Visitor Center\nof the route. Check out Angel Delgadillo\u2019s legendary barbershop, get shaved\nand buy one of the many souvenirs along the way.  \n  \nOn your way to Las Vegas, be welcomed at Lilo\u2019s Caf\u00e9, run by an emigrated\nGerman, before turning onto the dazzling Las Vegas Boulevard in the gambling\ncity.  \n  \nEnjoy the moment you enter, but don\u2019t get too distracted from traffic by these\nthousand glittering neon signs. Turn night into day, go play in the casinos,\nlet yourself drift. Las Vegas is full of surprises and superlatives. Don\u2019t\nmiss the Highroller, the biggest Ferris wheel in the world, and enjoy the wide\nview over the Las Vegas Strip at night in the closed gondolas.  \n  \nThe final part of Route 66 motorcycle tours takes you to the Sahara Oasis,\nAmboy and an old silver mine in the Mojave Desert. The place is called Calico\nand is a lovingly restored western town that really has a lot of atmosphere\nand is worth a visit.  \n  \nYou ride your bike your last stage and with it the last miles of the legendary\nRoute 66. Many motorcycle tours in the USA end here, at the Santa Monica Pier\nin Los Angeles, where the route officially ends. Here you have the chance to\nsavor the moment of your life when you could say that you have travelled\nacross the USA from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast.  \n  \nAfter handing in your motorcycles at the rental station in Santa Monica you\ncan stroll along the promenade and enjoy your fantastic impressions.  \n  \n\n### Classic No. 2: USA Motorcycle Tours along Highway No. 1\n\nMotorcycle tours in the U.S. often lead to Highway No. 1 - and rightly so.\nAmong connoisseurs some might complain about our classic ranking and instead\ndeclare Highway No. 1 without hesitation the most important of all motorcycle\ntours in the United States.  \n  \nFrom Los Angeles to San Francisco there is a beautiful route along the Pacific\ncoast. You start in Los Angeles, and after picking up the rental bikes, the\ntour starts at Santa Monica Pier towards Sunset Boulevard and Malibu.  \n  \nWhile the sun smiles on your bike and on the typical cityscape of L.A., you\nwill enjoy the passing route. The day\u2019s destination is Morro Bay and takes you\npast the Danish capital of America, with its numerous wineries, windmills,\nhorses and farms. The scenery is really worth seeing.  \n  \nThe next big destination is approaching: San Francisco. The route hugs the\nPacific to the left and lures with sights like the infamous prison Alcatraz,\nthe Golden Gate Bridge as well as Lombard Street and San Francisco\u2019s cable\ncars. As much as you enjoy riding your bike, it can\u2019t be a mistake to stay San\nFrancisco two to three days to see the city\u2019s highlights.  \n  \nHighway No. 1 connects the south and north of California from San Diego via\nLos Angeles to the north of San Francisco. It runs along particularly\nbeautiful stretches of coastline known from film and literature. The thriller\n\"Basic Instinct\" with Sharon Stone was shot there. The writer Jack Kerouac\ncreated a literary monument to the Big Sur area with his novel of the same\nname.  \n  \nSome motorcycle tours extend the classic Highway 1 tour by further impressive\ncuts along the Pacific Ocean far to the north - or start the route there going\nin the southern direction: in Seattle, where the much longer tour along the\nfamous coastal road Highway No. 1, combined with Highway 101, forms part of\nthe Panamericana, the \"dream road\" and longest road in the world. It leads\nfrom Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.\n\n### Classic No. 3: USA Motorcycle Tours in Florida\n\nIn Florida, summer, sun and sandy beaches welcome you next to the vibrant\ncities of Miami and Orlando. When not riding your motorcycle on one of our\nfantastic guided or self-guided tours, be sure to check out a sports event or\ntake a helicopter flight over Miami. In the evening you can drink a beer on\nthe famous Ocean Drive and see the most beautiful cars in the world pass by,\nwhich could only be surpassed by the even more beautiful sight of their co-\ndrivers.  \n  \nThe Florida Keys, which are especially recommended for motorcycle tours, are\nvery scenic. A long highway leads from the mainland to Key West - you and your\nbike - for a reward beer at Sloppy Joe\u2019s on Key West.
