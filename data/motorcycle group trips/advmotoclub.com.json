    "summary": "# THE ADVENTURE MOTORCYCLE CLUB\n\nJoin the Club\n\n## Who We Are\n\nBackcountry Expeditions is an exclusive Adventure Motorcycle Club with a\nunique membership of ADV enthusiasts. The ADV Moto Club delivers four\nfantastic riding opportunities for its members throughout each year, with one\nbeing run overseas. All rides are planned and supported to ensure the very\nbest experience for all riders taking part.\n\n### Why a Club?\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023 we ran tours and training opportunities but quickly\nreached capacity as demand increased. In our experience, too many incompatible\nriders undermines a great riding experience. We\u2019ve found that combining a\ngroup of likeminded riders alongside an epic location, at the right time of\nyear, on a well planned route is the secret to success. The ADV Moto Club\nbrings riders together with a bond and similar approach to their ADV riding\nambitions.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nMembership numbers are capped to guarantee we can maintain and deliver the\nhighest standards of any riding experience. Club members have access to four\nriding opportunities each year, timed to allow plenty of opportunity for\nvariety. All ride planning, delivery and support is provided by the ADV Moto\nClub. Riders either use their own motorcycle or rent one through our partners.\nThe Club also provides a logistical service that picks up, delivers and\nreturns members' motorcycles to ride locations.\n\nBackcountry Expeditions goes above and beyond again and again to make sure the\nclient is taken care of and has the best experience!  \n\nKlaus L\n\nJoin the Club\n\n### Our Experience\n\nPrior to the formation of Backcountry Expeditions in 2017, our two- and four-\nwheel expeditionary experience was honed in a military context. With over 21\nyears experience in planning and delivering global operations, we turned our\nattention to training and running tours in the western United States. Between\n2017 and 2023, we successfully delivered more than 100 motorcycle expeditions\ncovering 500,000+ miles of off-road adventures. We now focus our attention on\nrunning the best ADV Moto Club for our members.\n\n### Should I consider joining?\n\nThe ADV Moto Club is limited in numbers to protect the experience of all our\nmembers, but we are always looking for applicants to join when a place becomes\navailable. If you have the time, knowledge, experience and inclination to plan\nyour own ADV rides, then this might not be for you. But if you're looking for\nan organization to provide four great riding opportunities each year, with the\nknowledge that safety and support is assured, and that you\u2019ll be in the\ncompany of like minded riders, then we invite you to apply.\n\nNeil is a true professional who delivers a unique and exciting experience.\nHighly recommended!!!  \n\nMatthew B\n\nJoin the Club\n\n## Apply to Join the ADV Moto Club\n\nGreat adventure riding experiences depend on the motorcycle, location,\nweather, planning & most importantly, the other riders involved.
