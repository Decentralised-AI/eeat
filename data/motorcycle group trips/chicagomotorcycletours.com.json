The planning for lodging,\n> roads to travel left me truly fulfilled on the Sturgis trip 2022. Everything\n> I have ever read or seen about the South Dakota experience we saw, heard,\n> smelled and participated. The riders in our group were so much fun to be\n> around. Sharing the experience together of roads traveled for 9 days will\n> always be remembered fondly and not  \n> forgotten anytime soon.\n>\n> Lair\n\n> The tour was great, we started off not knowing anyone, and left with many\n> new friends. All my years & miles of riding I have never done such a ride\n> like that. The views of the dams were amazing, we all certainly got our\n> steps in. The hanging out at the hotels and the conversations were great.\n>\n> Ron Sodko\n\n> I loved this tour! Although I have ridden my bike in all 48 continental\n> states, I have never experienced the beauty that is the waterfalls of the\n> UP! The routes were very well planned to ensure we saw some of the best\n> waterfalls in the area without over doing it or feeling overly rushed.\n> Obviously great care was taken into the planning and execution. The ride\n> itself was very safe and I appreciate your attention to consistency and\n> safety by ensuring you communicate clearly that you do the speed limit, that\n> you accelerate gradually to limit rubber banding, and you continue to\n> reinforce the proper spacing of bikes. All led to a very safe ride for all!\n>\n> Caryl Lumpp\n\n> This year was my fourth Sturgis trip with your tour group and add in the\n> Washington DC trip, all trips have been great.\n>\n> James Wizniak\n\n> Rhonda and I had a blast. The route, weather, chase vehicle and trailer, and\n> company was terrific. Your knowledge and obvious expertise were well\n> appreciated. The accommodations were great as was the parking for the bikes.\n> The serene visits to all the waterfalls were especially enjoyed following\n> hours of Harley exhaust melodies.\n>\n> Hal & Rhonda Norman\n\n> We had a great time! The winding roads and scenery were amazing! Everybody\n> was a lot of fun!\n>\n> Cassie Nimerfroh\n\n> We booked our first Motorcycle tour with Mike and Kari the Trip around Lake\n> Michigan! Beautiful routes. Very well planned out. A nice group of people\n> that are now our new Harley family. We will definitely book another tour\n> with Mike! Great memories!\n>\n> Debbie Sammons Howie\n\n> Sturgis 2018, my first trip, had a great time, Mike Papp kept us on\n> schedule, he did a great job and Ronnie was quick to care of all of all your\n> needs, Don ran Clean up, also did a great job. A great crowd of riders,\n> everyone was quick to help each other out and welcoming to make friends. I\n> went into this trip knowing absolutely no one and made lots of friends . I\n> would highly recommend Windy City tours.\n>\n> Chris Ponce\n\n> We just retuned from the Windy City Motorcycle Lake Michigan Tour. My wife\n> and I have traveled all over the world and this trip was without a doubt the\n> best time we had. Jeff and Mike were outstanding and safe tour leaders. The\n> hotels and food were great. The people in our group were all terrific. We\n> are looking forward to our next Windy City Tour.\n>\n> Steve and Marge Anzalone\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n## Mike \"Man Of The People\" Papp\n\nContact Mike\n\n  * 2024 Tours \n
