The breathtaking landscapes and winding roads\noffered a truly exhilarating experience. The...\n\n...warmth and hospitality of Igor, Erik and Tomaz was a delightful layer to\nthe trip. Igor who made us laugh all the time and gave me (Cathi) pointers on\ncounter-steering (even touched my foot peg to the ground on turns) was a joy\nto be around. Erik was as the best leader we could ask for on the road and\nalways kept us safe. Tomaz, with his go to attitude and welcoming smile for us\nat the end of each days journey. Our connections we made with them and our\nfellow riders, enriched our adventure.Every twist and turn of the road in the\nDolomites and Tuscany was a reminder of the sheer beauty of our planet. It was\na trip that touched the soul and left an indelible mark on our hearts. If\nyou\\'re a motorcycle enthusiast and a lover of stunning landscapes, this\njourney is an absolute must.

From the time...\n\n...we arrived at our hotel in Vienna and were greeted by Mike (Owner) and Bob\nour tour guide with a nice cold local beer and a fabulous dinner I knew we\nwere in good hands. Mike, congratulations on putting together a top notch,\nfirst class tour company. From the newer bikes to the excellent accomodations\nand the awesome meals, everything exceeded my expectations. Not to mention our\namazing tour guide. Thanks again for everything Bob. You went above and beyond\nto ensure that we were happy and very well taken care of. The beautiful,\nscenic routes you chose for us were a great mix even for my limited riding\nskills. Count me in for the Balkans in 2025! I would highly recommend\nMototoursEurope for anyone considering a first class European Tour!\n\nread more \u00bb close \u00bb\n\nTed Tweedie, Burnaby, BC Canada\n\nWell, what can I say Mike you have certainly created a fantastic product with\nmototourseurope.com. We have just returned to New Zealand from 9 weeks of\ntripping around the world and part of this trip...\n\n...involved completing the 14-day Eastern European Treasures Tour from the\n27th of August to the 9th of September with Bob our guide. There ended up\nbeing 4 of us with 2 Canadian friends 2 Kiwis and Bob. From the initial\ninquiry using the website which I found easy to navigate and that\\'s saying\nsomething from a mid-60s Kiwi pensioner. Meeting both Mike and Bob at our\nhotel in Vienna quickly put our minds at ease with regard to the upcoming\ntour. Mike explained it all in detail and with the paperwork completed took us\ndownstairs to view the bikes for the first time. They were presented in\nimmaculate condition complete with top box and side panniers. Late model low\nmileage BMW\\'s and I must thank you again Mike for loaning me your own Africa\nTwin for the tour which was a pleasure to ride. We were then taken out for\ndinner and drinks which was a fantastic start to what was an absolutely top\ntrip. Bob had done all the scouting for this trip along with other tours as we\nfound out during the tour and we have seen parts of the world that I would not\nhave found had I tried to do this on my own. Now here in NZ we can end up\ntraveling 5500kms in the same time that we did 2200kms on this tour but found\nthat the average riding day of 270kms was certainly enough and allowed plenty\nof time in the afternoon to enjoy the local beers. All of the accommodation in\nthe cities was centrally located which made it easy to explore the main sites\nand all accommodation was of excellent standard including the castle stay up\nin the Tatas mountains. The food what more can I say than fantastic we ended\nup letting Bob organize a selection of local food every night which worked\nextremely well and Bob would also suggest places to dine on our layover days.\nDuring the day we would stop for morning coffee great lunches and an afternoon\ndrink break before reaching our destination for the day. If anyone out there\nis considering a motorbike tour of Europe I certainly would not look any\nfurther than mototourseurope and if I had to rate this tour out of 10 with 10\nbeing great I would have to rate it at 15. We are already looking to return in\n2025 to let Bob lead us on his favorite tour the 16-day Balkans Adriatic and\nAlbania Explorer. If anyone would like to know more please contact me directly\nand I will certainly provide any additional information. Once again Mike, Bob\nwhat a fantastic tour which I certainly will not forget and have lots of\nphotos to remember it by.Regards Dale\n\nread more \u00bb close \u00bb\n\nDale Carley, New Plymouth, New Zealand\n\nI've just finished a tour with Moto Tours Europe.
