The big advantage of Ride Free versus most any other\ntour company, is that I am completely flexible for the group. Example. On day\n2 if everyone is having a great time, feels like going for a hike/walk up a\nlittle mountain, we can do that and get back at sunset instead of afternoon. I\nam completely flexible, which is what makes it interesting. No rigid schedule\nhere. You are also welcome to stay with the group, or break away and regroup\nwhenever. Though people usually stay together because we are having such a\ngreat time.\n\n  * HOME\n    * Motorcycle Home\n    * Car Home\n  * ABOUT US\n    * The Team\n    * Our Mission\n  * TESTIMONIALS\n    * Testimonials\n    * Ride Free Motorcycle Rentals and Tours Gallery\n    * Blog Harley Motorcycle Rentals and Tours\n  * GUIDED TOURS\n    * Guided Motorcycle Tours\n    * Guided Car Tours\n    * CLASSIC CAR ROUTE 66 CHICAGO TO LA\n  * SELF DRIVE TOURS\n    * Self Drive Motorcycle Tour\n    * Self Drive Car Tours\n    * Mustang Route 66 Chicago to LA Self Drive Tour\n  * RENTALS\n    * Motorcycle Rentals\n    * Muscle Car Rentals\n    * Rent Mustang Route 66\n    * Motorcycle & Classic Car Sales\n    * Rent a Classic Car\n    * Hollywood Classic Picture Cars\n  * CONTACT\n    * Contact Us\n    * Ride Free Shirts and Merchandise\n\nSelect Page\n\n  * HOME\n    * Motorcycle Home\n    * Car Home\n  * ABOUT US\n    * The Team\n    * Our Mission\n  * TESTIMONIALS\n    * Testimonials\n    * Ride Free Motorcycle Rentals and Tours Gallery\n    * Blog Harley Motorcycle Rentals and Tours\n  * GUIDED TOURS\n    * Guided Motorcycle Tours\n    * Guided Car Tours\n    * CLASSIC CAR ROUTE 66 CHICAGO TO LA\n  * SELF DRIVE TOURS\n    * Self Drive Motorcycle Tour\n    * Self Drive Car Tours\n    * Mustang Route 66 Chicago to LA Self Drive Tour\n  * RENTALS\n    * Motorcycle Rentals\n    * Muscle Car Rentals\n    * Rent Mustang Route 66\n    * Motorcycle & Classic Car Sales\n    * Rent a Classic Car\n    * Hollywood Classic Picture Cars\n  * CONTACT\n    * Contact Us\n    * Ride Free Shirts and Merchandise\n\n**Riding on your tour was a**\n\n  \n\n**SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Julie Tran, Los Angeles, USA\n\nView Reviews\n\n**Riding on your tour was a**\n\n  \n\n**SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Julie Tran, Los Angeles, USA\n\nView Reviews\n\nThe Ride Free Tour was the\n\n  \n\n**BEST TRIP OF MY LIFE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Eric \u201cChampion du monde\u201d\n\n  \n\nThefaine, France\n\n  \n\nRoute 66\n\nView Reviews\n\nThe Ride Free Tour was the\n\n  \n\n**BEST TRIP OF MY LIFE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Eric \u201cChampion du monde\u201d\n\n  \n\nThefaine, France\n\n  \n\nRoute 66\n\nView Reviews\n\nThe tour I did with Ride Free was one of the\n\n  \n\n**BEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Fabien \u201dSpeedo\u201d Graille, France\n\nView Reviews\n\nRiding on your tour was a\n\n  \n\n**SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Julie Tran, Los Angeles, USA\n\nView Reviews\n\nRiding with Ride Free brought back all kinds of memories.\n\n  \n\n**I LOVED THE TOUR.**\n\n  \n\n\\- Elmer \u201dIronman\u201d, Alaska, USA\n\nView Reviews\n\nThank you for\n\n  \n\n**THE BEST VACATION EVER.**\n\n  \n\n\u2013 Bill and Judy Gore, Australia\n\nView Reviews\n\n# GUIDED MOTORCYCLE TOURS\n\nTOUR INFORMATION    |    WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED    |    MOTORCYCLE CHOICES    |\nWHERE WE STAY    |    GUIDED TOUR FAQ\u2019S\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\nTOUR INFORMATION  \nWHAT\u2019S INCLUDED  \nMOTORCYCLE CHOICES  \nWHERE WE STAY  \nGUIDED TOUR FAQ\u2019S\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\nWhy Choose Our Guided Motorcycle Tour?\n\nPersonal Care\n\nTalk to the owner anytime  \nWe care about your dream coming true  \nSmall family business, not corporate  \nEvery person is important to us  \nREAD MORE\n\nNo Mass Production\n\nSmall group  \nStay in small local hotels  \nGo to small local stops and restaurants  \nShorter riding days to experience more  \nREAD MORE\n\nReal American Experience\n\nAmerican tour guides and company  \nForeigners can't give the same  \nLearn what a real American ride is  \nLet us share our country with you  \nREAD MORE\n\n######\n\nRoute 66 Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nCalifornia Route 66 Grand Canyon Death Valley Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nSturgis Rally Motorcycle Tour \u2013 Denver or Vegas Loop\n\n######\n\nSturgis Motorcycle Tour Chicago to Las Vegas\n\n######\n\nCanadian Rockies Guided Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nNorthern California Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nWild West Motorcycle Tour Western Parks and California\n\n######\n\nAmerican History Washington DC Battlefields Tour\n\n######\n\nCalifornia and Northern CA Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nCalifornia Wine Guided Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nCalifornia Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nBlue Ridge Parkway Mountains Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nAmerican Music Motorcycle Tour\n\n######\n\nSan Francisco to Los Angeles Or SF to LA Guided Motorcycle Tour\n\nDEALS AND SPECIALS\n\nEARLY BOOKING DISCOUNT\n\nPASSENGERS RIDE FREE\n\nDEALS AND SPECIALS\n\n  *   Our RideFree experience was an adventure of epic proportions.

Just a short note to thank you for the \u2018BEST VACATION\nEVER\u2019. Both Brian and Andy were exceptionally professional and it is fair to\nsay that that trip would not have been as good without the professional and\nfriendly banter between the group and the guides. They were well able to cater\nfor the differences in the group and this aided the holiday. The locations,\nlodgings and roads traveled matched and, sometimes, exceeded our expectations.\nOn at least two occasions the accommodations were part of our dreams.
