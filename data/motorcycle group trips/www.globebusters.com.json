The sat nav routes\nwere perfect (with maps provided as well) and well thought through. I\nthoroughly recommend them.\n\nChris Stone\n\n2023-01-11\n\nI hear great things about thier tours website very good\n\nRichard Bowden-Doyle\n\n2022-11-27\n\nRecently back from my second expedition with Globebusters. I've ridden from\nLondon to Beijing and Nairobi to Cape Town with them. I can't think of anybody\nI'd trust more to arrange long distance trips across challenging territories.\nThey're professional, well organised and committed but most important of all,\nthey're great fun to travel with...\n\nMark Hailwood\n\n2022-11-24\n\nHaving travelled with Globebusters on two amazing Expeditions I have nothing\nbut praise for this organisation. Both trips (Trans Am and Southern Africa)\nfar exceeded my expectations and left me only wanting more of these fantastic\nexperiences. The organisation, planning, information, routes, accommodation,\nand the Globebusters team on the trip could not have been improved upon.  \nSo you may ask am I travelling with them again, well the answer is of course,\n2023 is Trans Am 2 for me it really was that good. So don't sit around\nthinking these trips are for everyone else or they will be as they are always\nin great demand, and to be honest 5 stars isn't really enough.  \nMark Hailwood\n\nRoger Andersson\n\n2022-10-28\n\nAbsolutely the best motorcycle tour operator\n\nJonathan Parrott\n\n2022-09-12\n\nI have just completed the Iceland Arctic Dessert Ride. Wow! what can I say\nfantastic. From the pre tour administration and bike shipping to the actual\nriding was all OUTSTANDING. The group leader (John) and support driver (Rhys)\nprovided guidance on riding, especially the off-road sections and were always\nthere to help; a credit to the GlobeBusters team. The accommodation was\nexcellent, and the daily rides were well thought through and of the\nappropriate distance. For a newbie to of road riding this tour provided a\nfantastic opportunity to improve, with the rides increasing progressively in\ndifficulty over the 10 days. I will definitely be booking future tours with\nGloBebusters, including some of the longer trips and will recommend them to\nothers. Thank you GlobeBusters.\n\nKen Shanks\n\n2022-09-11\n\nI just completed Globebuster's Icelandic Tour and it was fantastic. Iceland is\nthe most beautiful country I have visited and the tour Globebusters put on was\nfantastic, professionally run, organized, great, courteous, & fun tour\nleaders, very good mix of on-road and off-road rides each day, very good and\nclean hotels, great food (not a bad meal), and they provided great information\nfor each day's ride which allowed us to ride with the larger group or set our\nown pace and ride our own ride. If you are an adventure motorcycle rider, and\nwant to see some amazing places few others will ever see, you can't go with\nGlobebusters!\n\nGeorge revington\n\n2022-09-08\n\nBest Motorcycle tour out there for great routes and just the right amount of\nadventure\n\nNiall Rowan\n\n2022-06-15\n\n\u201cGlobebusters Aegean Adventure tour of Turkey is a full on cultural,\nhistorical and motorcycling experience delivered by a very professional tour\nguide.
