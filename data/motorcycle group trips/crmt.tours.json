Their location is a big plus. Cadday Rouge is moments away from\nbeautiful French villages, winding river roads, picturesque walled towns that\noverlook expansive valleys below, and impressive chateaux. Trevor is a capable\nand flexible guide, always checking in to see that the tour is going well for\nyou. He researches possible destinations and museums near your route that may\nreflect your interests. We ran across several that he had not been to before\nthat were really fun. I took the WWII tour and our destinations and\naccommodations on the trip to Rochelle and back were quite nice. Thank you\nagain to Patsy and Trevor for a great experience and some great riding. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMartin Rose\n\n _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_\n\n __Read More\n\nEverything was fabulous.

A\nbeautiful, immaculately kept house. New and well maintained motorcycles. A\nvariety of well chosen and well guided routes through a delightful part of\nFrance with time to visit churches, castles, markets and viewpoints. And a\npool to cool off at the end of each hot day's travelling before well made and\npresented meals. I'm pining for the next one already. Thanks!

The pool was amazing, just the right\ntemperature for cooling off and large enough to get in a few lengths. Trevor\nand Patsy were very accommodating and nothing was too much trouble and the\nfood was terrific. Clearly the highlight was the bike tours. We toured some\namazing places and learnt loads down to Trevors comprehensive knowledge of\nroutes and the region. We're coming back what more can I say. !!!\n\nRaymond Tabandeh\n\n _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_ _\ue934_\n\n __Read More\n\nPatsy and Trevor were great hosts. We got to see many lovely places.
