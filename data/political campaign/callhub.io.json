Barack Obama: Texting to mobilize voters\n    * Takeaways\n    * Additional Resources \n  * To conclude\n\n**The power of political marketing? $75 million on digital advertising.**\n\nThat\u2019s the amount democratic strategists plan to spend this year to counter\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign, which has already spent **$26 million on digital\nadvertising** so far.\n\nAmerican Media has undergone significant changes in the past few years,\nenabling digital media to become a more powerful political marketing tool.\n\nFor instance, there has been a major shift from traditional television to\nonline sources for those seeking political information.\n\nAs per a survey by the Pew Research Center, In 2016, **57% of the public often\ngot news on television compared to 38% who used online sources**.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, **television\u2019s regular audience declined to 50% of the\npopulation whereas the online news audience grew to 43%**\n\nThe rising trend of digital platforms is driving campaigners to spend more and\nmore on digital ads.\n\nThe WSJ reports that the total political spending on digital ads in 2018 was\nnearly $1.9 billion.\n\nThis number is expected to grow up to $2.8 billion in the year 2020.  Here\u2019s a\ngraph showing the exponential growth in digital ad spending over the years:\n\nAdvancements in digital communication have forced campaigners to innovate.\n\nHowever, they have also provided organizers with a myriad of opportunities for\noutreach and voter persuasion.\n\nGiven below are five campaigns leveraging these opportunities and setting\nbenchmarks of success.\n\n## 1\\. **Bernie Sanders: Rallying and engaging virtually**\n\nAs social distancing rules come into effect, campaigners are being pushed to\nlook for new ways for political marketing.\n\nWith this in mind, Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign organized its **first virtual\nrally** , which was live-streamed on multiple channels, including Facebook,\nPeriscope, and Twitch.\n\nThe rally featured pre-recorded performances from musicians, Jim James, Neil\nYoung, and the Free Nationals. Jim James and Neil Young also gave speeches\npersuading the public to support Bernie.\n\nThe event also featured recordings of campaign surrogates, including Phillip\nAgnews, Brianna Westbrook, Rep. Chuy Garcia, and Nina Turner, speaking about\nwhy they supported Bernie.\n\nLastly, it featured Bernie Sanders talking about medicare and his plan to\nimprove the country\u2019s medical facilities.\n\nA day before the virtual rally, the campaign also live-streamed a fireside\nchat. It included Bernie Sanders discussing his vision for the country and\nalso taking questions from the public through the comment section.\n\nThe objective of these virtual events was to reach voters while following the\nrules of social distancing. The campaign successfully engaged with a huge\ncommunity online and collectively drew **over 4.4 million viewers** for these\nevents.\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n  * **Leveraging influencers to draw crowds.**  \n\nCampaign surrogates have a positive impact on elections. If used right, these\ninfluencers can help campaigners persuade and mobilize voters relatively\neasily.\n\n  * **Break the monotony during online rallies**  \n\nListening to hour-long speeches can be dull. Plus, the absence of social\npressure in online events can make it even more tempting to disconnect.\n\nBy alternating between speeches and musical performances, Bernie\u2019s virtual\nrally ensures that the audience is hooked throughout the event.\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n  * Planning a successful virtual event in times of social distancing\n  * Digital Strategy for Political campaigns during the coronavirus\n  * A Comprehensive List of Tips, Tools, and Examples for Event Organizers\n  * Getting started with live-streaming on social media\n\n## 2\\. **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Connecting over Instagram-Live  **\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez leverages social media to connect with her voter\nsegment, using Instagram as her go-to social channel.\n\nShe frequently uses Instagram\u2019s live-streaming feature to engage with her\naudience and answer questions. She even adds a unique touch to them by\nconducting these streams in a very casual manner.\n\nFor instance, she recently conducted an AMA session with her followers while\nassembling IKEA furniture.\n\nThe scope of the questions ranges from her view on various political issues to\ngeneral questions about her life.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CNZitrKqs\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Instagram stories and live streams help her engage\nwith young tech-savvy supporters, a segment that has been crucial for her past\nvictories.\n\nThe casual, gaiety posts also reflect her as an average person, thereby\npositioning her as a relatable candidate.\n\nCongresswoman Alexandria\u2019s strong social media presence has helped her gain\nover **4 million followers** on Instagram. Her Twitter account also saw a\n**600% increase** in followers since June 2018.\n\n### **Takeaway**\n\n  * **Choosing live streaming over other forms of engagement**\n\n82% of viewers prefer viewing live streams over social media posts. While\ncandidates can express their opinions through posts (tweets, blogs, website\ncopy), mixing it up with live streams improves reach and nurtures a sense of\ncommunity with voters.\n\nLive streams also let candidates convey their message directly and with the\nintended intent It eliminates the possibility of the message being tainted and\nspread by others with biased commentary.\n\n  * **Positioning yourself to appeal to your target audience**\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez targets her message at young voters, a group\nincreasingly disillusioned by the idea of politicians as corporate stooges.\n\nTo appeal to this segment of voters, she portrays herself as an average person\n(through the different casual setup of her live-streams) trying to bring\nchange.\n\nTo top that, she also does that through a channel her supporters are\ncomfortable with. In doing this, she appeals to her niche rather than seeking\napproval from the masses.\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n  * How to Get Out The Vote with Social Media\n  * Social Media Guide for Political Campaigns\n  * Personalized Campaigns in Party-centered politics \u2013 Facebook and Twitter\n  * Political persuasion on social media: Tracing direct and indirect effects of news use and social interaction\n  * How Political Campaigns can use Instagram \n  * 21 Tips for Creating a Social Media Political Campaign\n  * Twitter tips for political candidates and campaigns\n  * How to use Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to create an effective Political Campaign\n\n## 3\\. **Jagmeet Singh: Canvassing and phone banking for persuasion**\n\nFor the NDP leadership in 2017, campaigners for Jagmeet Singh organized their\noutreach in three phases.\n\nThe first phase focused on onboarding as many new members for NDP as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, organizers utilized supporter networks for face-to-face\ncontact and canvassing efforts. Volunteers then followed up with these\ncontacts over phone calls or digital media to encourage them to register.\n\nThe second phase of the campaign was to classify existing members of the party\nas supporters and non-supporters of Jagmeet Singh.\n\nVolunteers called these members (who were not engaged earlier during the\ncampaign), filled up surveys based on their interactions, and classified them\naccordingly.  \n\nThe final phase of the campaign was getting new and existing members who\nsupported Jagmeet Singh out to vote.\n\nTo achieve this, volunteers followed up with all supporters over phone calls,\nemails, and social media encouraging and guiding them to cast their ballot.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, volunteers had brought in **47,000 new members** ,\nwhich was **38% of the total 124,000 members eligible to vote.   **\n\nThe personalized canvassing and GOTV efforts led to an overall **turnout of\n52.8%** , which led Jagmeet Singh to his victory.\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n  * **Leverage personal connections for more impact**\n\nWhile door-to-door canvassing in itself is quite beneficial for voter\noutreach, leveraging personal connections add to the impact.\n\nVolunteers from within the community have a better chance of reaching and\npersuading voters.\n\nWould you rather listen to a campaign volunteer you\u2019ve never met or a neighbor\nfrom across the street about your voting preferences?  \n\n  * **Have an omnichannel approach for voter contact**\n\nOmnichannel contact in political marketing is key to converting prospects into\nstrong supporters. While face-to-face contact is a great initial touchpoint,\nadditional touch points are required to nurture and motivate prospects.\n\n98% of Americans switch between devices every day and it\u2019s easy for your\nmessage to get lost in the digital noise. An omnichannel approach reinforces\nyour message ensuring that it\u2019s delivered and retained.\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n  * Strategies for effective voter outreach\n  * Guide to political phone banking\n  * Canvassing scripts for political campaigns\n  * Research-backed strategies for GOTV\n  * Creating the perfect phone banking script\n  * A guide to digital GOTV\n  * Relational organizing in the electoral context\n  * Relational organizing best practices\n  * Our Complete A-Z Guide To Boost Your Electioneering Efforts\n\n## 4\\. **Democrats Abroad:** **Personalized conversations for impact**\n\nPolitical marketing isn\u2019t just about the channels of communication, but also\nabout the communication itself.\n\nTo mobilize overseas votes during the 2018 midterms, Democrats Abroad ran\nremote phone banking campaigns. The objective of the campaign was to increase\nvoter turnout overseas.\n\nThe primary reasons for low voter turnout earlier were lack of information and\nguidance.\n\nMoreover, each case was different. While some supporters were unaware of the\nvoting process, others were unclear about updating their information, and some\nweren\u2019t clear about the documentation needed.\n\nThe CallHub call center solution allowed volunteers to note down these details\n(issues voters were facing) during their interactions. With this information\nat hand, volunteers could follow up with these voters with more resources and\na complete plan of action.\n\nFor instance, a voter had moved to a new district and was unclear about the\nstate laws on updating his information.\n\nDuring their first interaction, a volunteer noted this down. The next time, a\nvolunteer called, she had all the details that the voter needed to update his\nregistration information.\n\nWith a complete picture of the voter, volunteers were able to make each\ninteraction more valuable and personalized. They were able to better navigate\nvoters through the barriers that were keeping them from voting.\n\nThe result; Democrats Abroad was able to **reach out to over 150,000 members\nabroad** and drive a **300% increase** in overseas voter turnout in the 2018\nmidterms.\n\n### **Takeaway**\n\n  * **Have personalized conversation for greater impact**\n\nDemocrats Abroad volunteers collected all details about the voters in the\nfirst interaction itself. This allowed them to craft their follow-ups with a\nplan of action that voters could actually go through.\n\nWith more actionable data to work with, each interaction became more valuable.\nThis, in turn, got voters to be more invested in the campaign.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you rather be more interested in conversations on how you can bring\nchange rather than just the importance of change?\n\n  * **Leveraging the right tool for campaigning.  **\n\n**52% of people** are frustrated when callers don\u2019t have the information they\nprovided earlier while **59% of people** are irritated by generic pitches.\n\nDemocrats abroad were able to avoid both by using a tool that allowed them to\ntake down notes during a call that reflected in the membership database in\nreal-time.\n\nWith this information at hand, any volunteer could craft a follow-up for the\nsame voter with exactly what they wanted to know. This helped eliminate\ndependencies and made the process faster and more seamless.\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n  * Guide to political phone banking\n  * How to use calling and texting for supporter outreach\n  * Creating the perfect phone banking script\n  * How to vote as an American living abroad\n  * Preparing volunteers for phone-banking\n\n## 5\\. **Barack Obama: Texting to mobilize voters**\n\nWhile the Obama campaign understood the importance of digital communication in\npolitical marketing, they wanted to expand their reach to new channels.\n\nThus, watching the growing trend towards mobile, they decided to use texts to\nenhance communication.\n\nIn order to entice people to sign up for text updates, the campaign used a\nvariety of tactics. They offered free campaign ringtones, wallpapers, and even\nbumper stickers to those who signed up.\n\nOne of their most successful SMS marketing tactics was when Obama stated that\nhe would announce the vice-presidential choice to his supporters via text.\n\nThe campaign also engaged with the community deeply, by allowing them to text\nquestions over the same thread and receive answers.\n\nFor example, if someone texted a question about the Iraq War, everyone would\nget back a response with Obama\u2019s position on it along with the link to his\nwebsite for more specific information.\n\nObama prioritized his followers by conveying information to them before\ninforming the general public through mass media.\n\nBy making them feel part of an exclusive community that was closer to the\ncandidate, he made his supporters feel more appreciated and valued.\n\nWith these strategies, the campaign was able to drive over **3 million sign-\nups** and mobilize them during the campaign.\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n  * **Offer incentives to build SMS lists.  **\n\nBuying lists don\u2019t get you in front of the right audience. However, by\nproperly incentivizing sign-ups, you\u2019ll draw in a more targeted and authentic\nuser base.\n\n  * **Make supporters feel appreciated to mobilize them.  **\n\nThe campaign ensured that supporters were recognized by establishing a\ndialogue with them and prioritizing them for updates.\n\nBy building a relationship with the voters as an exclusive community, they\nwere able to mobilize them with relatively lesser effort.\n\n### **Additional Resources  **\n\n  * How political campaigns can use calling and texting for outreach\n  * How to choose the best SMS marketing service for your political campaign\n  * Guide to P2P Texting for GOTV\n  * Are you making these five political text messaging mistakes?\n  * Text message marketing for political campaigns\n\n## **To conclude**\n\nA strong digital strategy for political marketing has become a necessity\nrather than a good-to-have option.\n\nThe time individuals are spending on digital media is on a steep incline and\ndeclining quickly for traditional media (like newspapers, television, radio,\netc.).\n\nSo why do you need to be more present on digital media? The answer is simple\nbecause all your supporters are there.\n\nThe longer you spend off of digital mediums, the more voters you lose to\ncandidates leveraging the opportunity and reaping the benefits of digital\nengagement.\n\nPlus, in times of crisis like these, digital engagement is turning out to be\nthe only sustainable method of outreach.\n\nWhile making a switch to a digital-first political marketing strategy might\nseem daunting at first, you can start with simple steps.\n\nUsing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as inspiration, conduct a live-streaming Q&A\nsession for your supporters\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Political Campaign\n\nNandhaan Verma\n\nNandhaan is a marketer with nearly 5 years of experience researching & writing\nabout communication for nonprofits, advocacies, & political campaigns.
