Acknowledgments\n\n# Election Campaigns\n\n### What are election campaigns?\n\nElection campaigns are the means by which candidates and political parties\nprepare and present their ideas and positions on issues to the voters in the\nperiod preceding election day. Contestants use a variety of techniques to\nreach voters and deliver their messages, including through traditional and new\nmedia, public events, written materials, or other means. In some countries,\npublic media and/or space are allocated to contestants for these purposes\n(considered indirect public campaign financing). The dates of an official\nelection campaign period, usually a period of a month or several months\nleading up to election day, are often legally defined. In many countries, the\nlegal window for campaigning will end a day or two prior to election day,\nproviding a so-called \"black-out period\" immediately before voting begins.\nParties and candidates will establish physical premises from which they carry\nout campaign activities and overall operations.\n\n### Why do election campaigns matter?\n\nDemocratic elections require an informed as well as a free vote and a fair\nchance for contestants to win support and motivate supporters to help them\ngain office. Election campaigns are vital to achieving those goals. Elections\nthat are genuinely competitive offer equitable opportunities for contestants\nto convey their positions to citizens and compete for votes. Election\ncampaigns provide candidates and political parties with opportunities to\npresent their message to citizens, helping voters make educated and informed\ndecisions on election day. In order to help ensure an even playing-field and\nan election that ultimately reflects the will of citizens, any public\nresources allocated to election contestants must be equitable. Decision-making\nprocesses about how those resources are allocated should be transparent, so\ncontestants and the broader public can understand and trust the outcomes. With\naccess to information about election campaigns, including the official\ncampaign window and public resource allocations, parties and candidates can\ndesign their campaign activities and understand what they are entitled to from\nthe state, if anything. Access to data about election campaigns allows\ncontestants and civil society to explore whether candidates have equitable\naccess to whatever public campaign resources are provided in a given context,\nif any, including media and space for campaign events like rallies. Where\npublic media is allocated to contestants, then parties, candidates and\ncitizens can consider whether the allocation process was credible and the\nresulting allocations, equitable. Even in contexts in which there is no\nallocation of public resources for campaigns, contestants and civil society\ncan examine whether there was any unfair or biased treatment in how\ncontestants were allowed to conduct their operations. This might include\nwhether party offices were permitted to operate, or whether permits were\ndistributed in an unbiased manner for rallies or other campaign events.\nTransparency in these areas boosts confidence in the election process on the\npart of contestants and voters, and may serve to shed light on any unfair\npractices or potential abuses of state power where they exist.\n\n### Example election campaign data\n\nElection campaign data includes information about the timetable for official\nelection campaigns, as well as campaign regulations or restrictions.\nInformation also includes official data on party and candidate operations,\nsuch as their ability to rent space. Additional campaign data includes\ninformation about how contestants are allocated public resources for\ncampaigning, such as media or use of public spaces. Data about media\nallocations includes information relating to the decision-making process (the\nsystem used for the allotment, such as a lottery) and outcomes (i.e. who has\nwhich slots). Relevant data can also include information about applications\nfor rally permits -- including who applied, when, why, whether the application\nwas accepted or denied, and, if denied, why.\n\n  * __Ballot Qualification\n  * Campaign Finance __\n\n# Sign up for updates\n\n\u00d7  Please enter your email to receive updates when new modules or tools are\nadded Sign up\n\n  * Election  \nData Guide\n\n  * Data  \nInventory\n\n  * Data  \nAcademy\n\n  * Assessment  \nGuide\n\n  * Contact\n\n  *   *   * \n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n\u2014 Content licensed under a CC Attribution 4.0 International License\n\n",
