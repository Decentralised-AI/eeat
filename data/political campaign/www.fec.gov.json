Contributions are subject to the limits listed in this chart.\n\n### Contribution limits for 2023-2024\n\n|  | Recipient  \n---|---|---  \n|  | Candidate committee | PAC\u2020 (SSF and nonconnected) | Party committee:\nstate/district/local | Party committee: national | Additional national party\ncommittee accounts\u2021  \nDonor | Individual | $3,300* per election | $5,000 per year | $10,000 per year\n(combined) | $41,300* per year | $123,900* per account, per year  \nCandidate committee | $2,000 per election | $5,000 per year | Unlimited\ntransfers | Unlimited transfers |  \nPAC: multicandidate | $5,000 per election | $5,000 per year | $5,000 per year\n(combined) | $15,000 per year | $45,000 per account, per year  \nPAC: nonmulticandidate | $3,300* per election | $5,000 per year | $10,000 per\nyear (combined) | $41,300* per year | $123,900* per account, per year  \nParty committee: state/district/local | $5,000 per election (combined) |\n$5,000 per year (combined) | Unlimited transfers | Unlimited transfers |  \nParty committee: national | $5,000 per election** | $5,000 per year |\nUnlimited transfers | Unlimited transfers |  \n  \n_*Indexed for inflation in odd-numbered years._\n\n_\u2020\u201cPAC\u201d here refers to a committee that makes contributions to other federal\npolitical committees.Independent-expenditure-only political committees\n(sometimes called \u201cSuper PACs\u201d) may accept unlimited contributions, including\nfrom corporations and labor organizations._\n\n_\u2021The limits in this column apply to anational party committee\u2019s accounts for:\n(i) the presidential nominating convention; (ii) election recounts and\ncontests and other legal proceedings; and (iii) national party headquarters\nbuildings. A party\u2019s national committee, Senate campaign committee and House\ncampaign committee are each considered separate national party committees with\nseparate limits.

Communications over the internet are not considered\n\"public communications,\" except for communications placed for a fee on another\nperson\u2019s website, digital device, application or advertising platform.\nCommunications over the internet are discussed in the section \"Using a\ncomputer for political activity.\"\n\nLearn more about advertising and disclaimers\n\n### Coordinated communications\n\nWhen an individual or group pays for a communication that is coordinated with\na campaign, a candidate, a political party committee, or with an agent of a\ncampaign, candidate, or political party committee, the communication results\nin an in-kind contribution subject to limitations and prohibitions, and must\ndisplay a disclaimer notice.\n\nLearn more about coordinated communications\n\n### Independent expenditures\n\nIndividuals and groups may support or oppose candidates by making independent\nexpenditures. An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication\nthat expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate and which is not made in coordination with any campaign, candidate,\npolitical party committee, or with an agent of any campaign, candidate, or\npolitical party committee.\n\nIndependent expenditures are not subject to any contribution limits, but may\nbe subject to reporting requirements. (The campaign of a candidate benefiting\nfrom an independent expenditure has no reporting obligation.) An independent\nexpenditure must display a disclaimer notice.\n\nLearn more about making and reporting independent expenditures\n\n### Acting as a group\n\nA group of persons must register as a political committee within 10 days of\nraising or spending more than $1,000 in contributions or expenditures during a\ncalendar year if the group\u2019s major purpose is federal campaign activity (that\nis, the nomination or election of federal candidates). Groups that wish to\navoid registration and disclosure should make certain that their activities do\nnot exceed this registration threshold.\n\nLearn more about the requirements for political committees\n\n## Volunteering\n\n### Personal services\n\nAn individual may help candidates and committees by volunteering personal\nservices. For example, a volunteer may want to take part in a voter drive or\noffer skills to a political committee. Volunteer services are not considered\ncontributions as long as the volunteer is not paid by anyone. (If services are\ncompensated by someone other than the committee itself, the payment is\nconsidered a contribution by that person to the committee.)\n\nA volunteer may spend unlimited money for normal living expenses.\n\n### Home events\n\nIndividuals may use their homes and personal property for activities\nbenefiting a candidate or political party without making a contribution. For\ninstance, an individual might want to hold a fundraising party or reception in\nhis or her home. Costs for invitations and for food and beverages served at\nthe event are not considered contributions if they remain under certain\nlimits. These expenses on behalf of a candidate are limited to $1,000 per\nelection; expenses on behalf of a political party are limited to $2,000 per\nyear. Any amount spent in excess of the limits is a contribution to the\ncandidate or party committee.\n\n###  \nCorporate or union facilities\n\nIndividuals who are employees, stockholders or members of a corporation or\nlabor union may use the organization's facilities\u2014for example, the phone\u2014in\nconnection with personal volunteer activities, subject to the rules and\npractices of the organization. The activity, however, cannot prevent an\nemployee from completing normal work, nor can it interfere with the\norganization's normal activity.\n\nIf volunteer activity exceeds \"incidental use\" of the facilities\u2014one hour a\nweek or four hours a month\u2014a volunteer must reimburse the corporation or union\nthe normal rental charge within a commercially reasonable time. If a volunteer\nuses the organization's equipment to produce campaign materials, reimbursement\nis required regardless of how much time is spent. Any reimbursement for use of\nfacilities is considered a contribution from the individual to the political\ncommittee that benefits.\n\n## Using a computer for political activity\n\nAn uncompensated individual or group of individuals may engage in internet\nactivities for the purpose of influencing a federal election without\nrestriction.\n\nThis exemption applies to individuals acting with or without the knowledge or\nconsent of a campaign or a political party committee. Possible internet\nactivities include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Sending or forwarding email\n  * Providing a hyperlink to a website\n  * Creating, maintaining or hosting a website and paying a nominal fee for the use of a website.\n\nPlease note that these exemptions apply regardless of whether the individual\nowns the computer he or she is using.\n\n### Using a work computer for online political activity\n\nPersonal use of computers and internet access is allowed, subject to the\nemployer\u2019s rules and so long as the individual is not compensated for the\nactivity.\n\n### Sending personal emails regarding political topics or federal elections\n\nIndividuals may send unlimited emails on any political topic without\nidentifying who they are or whether their messages have been authorized by any\nparty or campaign committee.\n\n### Posting comments to a blog in connection with a federal election\n\nUncompensated blogging, whether done by individuals or a group of individuals,\nincorporated or unincorporated, is exempt from regulation, even in those cases\nwhere a nominal fee is paid.\n\n### Paying to place an ad on someone else\u2019s website\n\nInternet communications placed on another person\u2019s website, digital device,\napplication or advertising platform for a fee are considered \"general public\npolitical advertising,\" and are thus \"public communications\" under the law. As\nsuch, these payments may result in contributions or expenditures. Other\nregulations regarding coordinated communications and disclaimer requirements\nwould also apply. Refer to the previous section on public communications for\nmore information.\n\n## Presidential elections\n\nPresidential elections are subject to many of the same funding rules as House\nand Senate campaigns. For information on how to support a presidential\ncandidate, see the information on this page regarding contributions, public\ncommunications and volunteering.\n\nGet information on topics unique to the presidential election process\n\n## Filing a complaint\n\nAnyone can submit a complaint if he or she believes a violation of the law has\noccurred or is about to occur.
