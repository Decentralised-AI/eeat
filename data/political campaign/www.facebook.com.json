Fortunately, there are a lot of robust offerings on our platforms\nto help with your launch. We want to make sure that you have the information\nyou need to seamlessly get set up. Use the checklist below for an overview of\nthe basics for organic and advertising products so you can successfully launch\nyour campaign.\n\n###  **Secure your profile**\n\nBefore you create your campaign or organization\u2019s Page, make sure that your\nprofile is secure:\n\n  *  **Privacy Checkup** will help you determine who can see what you share and who can find your profile on Facebook.\n  *  **Security Checkup** will help you log out of unused apps and browsers, set up two-factor authentication and strengthen your password.\n  *  _Two-Factor Authentication_ is a security feature that helps protect your Facebook account in addition to your password.\n\n###  **Create your campaign Page**\n\nA Page is a public presence designed for connecting with people at scale who\nyou may or may not know personally. We recommend people and organizations\ninvolved in politics create a Facebook Page, rather than a profile. Your Page\nis managed by profiles (such as your own profile, and that of employees at\nyour organization or on your campaign team) and will have access to tools such\nas Page Insights and the ability to advertise. Be sure to add a profile\nPicture or organizational logo, and a Cover Photo. Learn more about how to\ncreate your Page here and how to request a verified badge here.\n\n###  **Secure your Page**\n\nThe best way to secure your Page is to enroll the profiles that manage your\ncampaign Page in **Facebook Protect** **,** which offers candidates and all of\ntheir staff a way to further secure their own accounts. By enrolling, we help\nyou (1) adopt stronger account security protections, like two-factor\nauthentication, and (2) monitor for potential hacking threats.\n\n###  **Start posting to your Page**\n\nThere are many ways on Facebook to show what your campaign or organization\nstands for. You can add your perspective on breaking news, solicit input from\nyour community, share a candid photo or Story to highlight your personality,\nor even bring your followers along on your campaign with Live video. Keep in\nmind that Facebook is where people connect with friends, family and\ncommunities that matter to them. Authenticity is key\u2014one of the best ways to\nconnect with supporters is to show them who you are and what you are about.\nLearn more content best practices here.\n\n###  **Understand our advertising requirements**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the important steps above, including securing your\naccounts and setting up a Page, follow the below requirements if you decide to\nrun ads:\n\n  * Ensure you have admin access to your campaign Page, either through your profile or through Business Manager (see below)\n  * Set up a Business Manager, which will house all of your campaign\u2019s assets and manage permissions. If you work with an agency, you\u2019ll be able to create a partnership with their business.\n  * If you\u2019re running ads yourself, create an Ad Account in your Business Manager.\n  * Ensure you have set up a payment method for your Ad Account.\n  * Comply with our policies for ads about social issues, elections or politics:\n    * Get individually authorized to run ads\n      * This process may take up 2 weeks so make sure to get started early.\n    *  _Create a disclaimer_ by going to the \u201cIssue, Electoral or Political Ads\u201ds tab in Page Settings\n    * Link your disclaimer to your newly created Ad Account for your campaign\n    * Assign a Page Owner. Once you create your disclaimer, you can use your disclaimer to indicate your Page Owner. You can also set your Page Owner to be your verified Business Manager, if your Business Manager is verified.\n    *  _Note: you must complete all of these steps in order to run ads_\n  * When you create your first ad, ensure that you select the \u201csocial issues, elections, or politics\u201d special ad category in Ads Manager at the campaign level, before submitting your ad for review.\n\nIf you are partnering with an agency, we still encourage you to follow all the\nsteps above -- especially if you plan to ever _boost posts_ or run ads in\naddition to your agency\u2019s work. However, if your agency is handling all\nadvertising, you can allow them to set up the ad account. You can also assign\nassets, including an Ad Account, within your Business Manager to your agency.\n\nIf you need any help when getting started with your campaign, you can review\n_this checklist_ for running ads about social issues, elections, or politics;\nand you can also reach out to our team.\n\nMay 7, 2023\n\n### US: Launching Your Campaign on Meta Technologies\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\n### Defining Your Campaign Presence on Facebook\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\n### Troubleshooting Disclaimers for Ads About Social Issues, Elections or\nPolitics in the United States\n\nBest Practices\n\nBest PracticesAdvocacy GroupsAgenciesElected OfficialsElection\nRegulatorsGovernment OrganizationsIntergovernmental\nOrganizationsNonprofitsPolitical Organizations and Candidates for Office\n\nGoals\n\nDrive Website TrafficEngaging Your CommunityGrow Your CommunityIncrease\nAwarenessInspire Your Community to Take Action\n\nInspiration\n\nCreativeInsightsOn-Demand Video Library\n\nResource Center\n\nBlog\n\nGet Help\n\nPolicies\n\nCommunity StandardsAdvertising StandardsDeveloper PoliciesPlatform Terms\n\nMeta \u00a9 2024\n\n",
