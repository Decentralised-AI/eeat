The law requires detailed\ndisclosure of the role of money in California politics. This includes the\ndisclosure of contributions and expenditures in connection with campaigns\nsupporting or opposing state and local candidates and ballot measures as well\nas the disclosure of expenditures made in connection with lobbying the State\nLegislature and attempting to influence administrative decisions of state\ngovernment.\n\nMore about the Political Reform Division\n\n##  Filing Information and Requirements\n\n### Electronic Filing Information\n\n  * Application for Password\n  * Cal-Online Free Online Filing Forms\n  * Approved Vendor Information\n\n### Campaign Filing Requirements\n\n  * Getting Started\n  * Current Filing Schedules\n  * Where to File\n  * Penalties\n\n### Campaign Disclosure Forms\n\n  * Campaign Forms and Instructions\n\n### Lobbying Filing Requirements\n\n  * Ethics Training\n  * Filing Deadlines\n  * Required Documents for Registration, Amendment, Termination, and Withdrawal\n  * Required Documents for Quarterly Disclosure Reports\n  * Penalties\n\n### Lobbying Forms\n\n  * Lobbying Forms and Instructions\n\nMore CAL-ACCESS Resources\n\n##  What is Cal-Access?\n\nCal-Access provides financial information supplied by state candidates,\ndonors, lobbyists, and others.
