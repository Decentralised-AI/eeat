Becoming a\ncandidate is only the beginning of the election process. Successful candidates\nmust both persuade voters that they deserve their individual votes and garner\nthe critical votes of electors in the Electoral College.\n\nPersuading voters is the essence of a political campaign. Advertising, theme\nsongs, stump speeches, and even negative campaigning have been around since\nour country began, and each advance in technology since then has offered new\nopportunities for candidates to persuade voters. Study the campaign poster of\nMillard Fillmore from 1850. Would the figures of Justice and Liberty wearing\ngowns and tiaras surrounding Millard Fillmore sway a modern voter? Probably\nnot, but notice the American flags in both of these posters. We certainly see\nthat imagery in advertisements for candidates running in current presidential\nelections.\n\n    Left: Millard Fillmore; right: Page 1 of Honest old Abe: song & chorus words by D. Wentworth, Esq.; music by a Wide Awake.\n\nDevelopments in photographic techniques sparked new campaign strategies. For\nexample, in 1860, photographs of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin were\nfeatured on campaign buttons. Campaigns still relied on tried and true ways to\npersuade voters, such as sheet music, and direct contact between voters and\ncandidates. One voter sent these specific questions to Abraham Lincoln:\n\n> Sir,  \n>  1st-- Suppose you should be elected President of the United States and the\n> South would not submit to your inauguration: What would you do? --  \n>  2nd -- Are you opposed to slavery as it now exists in the slave states, and\n> if so, do you believe that Congress has more power to remove it from those\n> states than to protect it in the Territories?  \n>  3rd -- Were you in favor of J[ohn] Brown the Traitor, or do you now\n> occasionally drop a silent tear or two in honor to his memory?  \n>  I am a voter and I want to know exactly every inch of ground you stand upon\n> -- I want to know for I want to vote for the right kind of a man -- If you\n> suit me I'll go for you -- If not away with you!!\n>\n> From Thomas T. Swan to Abraham Lincoln, June 15. 1860\n\nAnd That is How Benny Got In A Song for the Coming Campaign\n\nListen to an audio clip of candidate Calvin Coolidge on the subject of Law and\nOrder. It's hard to imagine this monotone voice, this \"man of few words\"\nappealing to modern voters. Coolidge faced a public appeal challenge even in\nhis own day, yet voters elected Coolidge when he ran. Coolidge's emphasis on\ntraditional values, frugality and economy in government would be familiar\ntopics in a presidential debate today. If a candidate's message speaks to the\npeople, if they choose their issues wisely, the office of president may be\ntheirs. This was true in Coolidge's time; is it still true today?\n\nOver time the media has changed, and today's campaign strategies reflect the\nuse of statistical analysis and the science of influence and affect. Today, a\ncandidate's every word, every action, and even their perceived thoughts are\nparaded before the public. However, many of the methods for persuading voters\nremain essentially the same.\n\n  * __ Previous Section Political Primaries: How Are Candidates Nominated?\n  * __ Next Section What is the Electoral College?\n\n## Part of\n\n  * Primary Source Sets\n  * Lesson Plans\n  * Presentations\n\n  * Elections \n  * The Presidential Election Process \n    * Requirements for the President of the United States \n    * Political Parties \n    * Political Primaries: How Are Candidates Nominated? \n    * Persuading Voters: Political Campaigns \n    * What is the Electoral College? \n  * The Right to Vote \n  * Issues from Past Presidential Campaigns \n\n## Additional Navigation\n\n  * Teachers Home \n\nThe Library of Congress offers classroom materials and professional\ndevelopment to help teachers effectively use primary sources from the\nLibrary's vast digital collections in their teaching.\n\n  * Analysis Tool & Guide \n\nTo help your students analyze these primary sources, get a graphic organizer\nand guides.\n\n__ Back to top\n\nFollow Us\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * Take our survey _External_\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Legal\n  * Inspector General\n  * External Link Disclaimer\n  * USA.gov\n  * Careers\n  * Contact\n  * Media\n  * Donate\n  * Shop\n\n  *   * \n\n",
