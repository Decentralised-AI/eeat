Kasschau\n\nMember\n\n## More on Our Practice\n\n__Political Law\n\nTwitter __ Facebook __ Linkedin __\n\nRunning for office is a long and arduous process. Politics can be messy.\nCandidates can encounter numerous landmines. One misstep can sink a campaign.\n\nWith that in mind, here are eight steps integral to a political campaign:\n\n## Gather Support\n\nTalk to people. Family, friends, neighbors. Make sure those closest to you are\non board and willing to help. But don\u2019t stop there. Attend neighborhood and\ncivic group meetings. Listen to the issues that come up. Establish yourself as\nsomeone who cares and wants to help on those issues.\n\nVisit with the political party of your choice. Ask if endorsement and\nresources are a possibility. An endorsement can be the difference between\nfailure and success. Resources help you tell your story and generate support.\n\n## Do Your Research\n\nTalk to people who have run for, or held, office, especially the office you\nare seeking. How did they build their campaign? How much help did they need?\nHow much money did they raise? What did they learn \u2013 good or bad? Are there\nlocal \u201cbootcamps\u201d that can help you learn how to campaign?\n\nFigure out how to get on the ballot. What are the requirements for the seat\nand do you meet them? What is the deadline for filing? What paperwork must be\nsubmitted? Do you need to collect signatures? Visit your state\u2019s secretary of\nstate website for details. An experienced election attorney can help with this\nprocess.\n\nVisit your local elections office and ask for the party registration and\naddresses of voters. You might have to pay for it, but it is a treasure trove\nwaiting to be analyzed and utilized by your campaign to target strategy and\ncommunications.\n\n## Build Your Campaign Staff\n\nIf you\u2019ve gathered your support, you\u2019ll no doubt have many you know well\nwilling to help. But you might need more \u2013 people with experience and\nexpertise.\n\nIt all starts with a campaign manager to plot overarching strategy and ensure\neffective oversight of all campaign activity. Then other key positions, such\nas a communications leader to help hone messaging and a finance leader to\nmanage contributions and help you stay in compliance with complicated campaign\nfinance laws. A volunteer coordinator for strategic deployment of your\nfaithful friends and family who will pass out literature, knock on doors and\nplant signs.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll be responsible for a lot of these duties yourself, as a\ncandidate tends to have his or her hands in everything. But putting the right\npeople in the right spots can be the key to a successful campaign.\n\n## Hone Your Messaging\n\nIdentify the issues important to the office you are seeking and prepare a\nposition on those issues. Simplify those thoughts into easily-digestible sound\nbites that appeal to voters. Be prepared for questions you might be asked.\nPractice answering, debating, interviewing.\n\nDevelop a website, social media accounts, literature and signs containing your\nkey messages so voters know how you stand on important issues.\n\n## Fundraise!\n\nPolitical campaigns require money \u2013 to pay workers, to buy advertising, for a\ncampaign office, website, signs. You\u2019ll likely need more money than you think.\n\nMake sure to pitch not only yourself when asking for money, but the changes\nyou intend to make. Connect with donors on issues that matter to them and\nthey\u2019re more likely to contribute.\n\n## Learn and Follow Campaign Finance Laws\n\nReporting requirements for political offices vary widely and each candidate\nmust ensure they are familiar with those pertaining to the office they seek.\nKnow the legal requirements, the forms that need to be filed and the deadlines\nfor reporting contributions. Make sure you know when donations can be\naccepted, donation limits and what information you must collect from donors.\n\nThen ensure your campaign stays in compliance. Hire an experienced financial\nexpert. Train those who will be charged with fundraising activity. Develop\nbasic procedures for processing and recording all contributions and\nexpenditures. Ensure required reports are filed by designated deadlines.\n\nCampaign finance laws are complex. Consider hiring an experienced attorney to\nhelp ensure you stay in compliance.\n\n## Hustle\n\nA successful candidate will need to meet and make a favorable impression on\nmany voters. That means door-to-door canvassing, phone calls, neighborhood and\ncivic meeting and a plethora of other networking opportunities. Candidates\nneed incredible stamina to ensure voters have a positive reaction when they\nstep into the voting booth.\n\nBut few can meet all voters. Candidates also need volunteers with tireless\ndevotion to distribute signs, pass our literature and conduct other campaign\nactivities. And, if you don\u2019t reach voters that way, active social media\naccounts and paid advertising are an option.\n\nThe candidates who work the hardest don\u2019t always win, but hustle is an\nimportant ingredient to many winning campaigns.\n\n## Learn Recount Rules\n\nNo one likes a sore loser, but if the race is close enough for a recount, you\nshould seek one. Familiarize yourself with the rules and hire an experienced\nelection attorney to help you navigate the process, which could be complex and\ntime-consuming. Don\u2019t lose your race because of someone else\u2019s mistakes!\n\n_This alert is not a substitute for advice of counsel on specific legal\nissues._\n\nHarris Beach has offices throughout New York state, including Albany, Buffalo,\nIthaca, New York City, Rochester, Saratoga Springs, Syracuse, Uniondale and\nWhite Plains, as well as Washington D.C., New Haven, Connecticut and Newark,\nNew Jersey.\n\n### Need More Information?\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nNote\n\nSubmit\n\n__\n\nContact us\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Legal Disclaimer\n  * Site Map\n\nAttorney Advertising.
