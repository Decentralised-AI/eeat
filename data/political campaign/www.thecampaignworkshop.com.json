While much of this may seem\nlike common sense (and it is), it's crucial to bear with me, as many of these\nessential aspects are often overlooked during campaign development.\nEssentially, a strong political campaign strategy (meaning, the overall plan\nto achieve an electoral victory) should rest on a foundation of some very\nbasic building blocks and principles that will help carry you across the\nfinish line.  \n  \n **Don\u2019t run unless you have a chance to win.** Running repeatedly is not a\nsound strategy when it comes to building name recognition or creating a road\nmap to victory. \"Oh, that person has run for office and lost nine times\u2014they\ndefinitely seem like the right choice to solve my community's problems,\" said\nno one, EVER. In fact, the more times you run and lose, the less likely you\nare to win. Do the name recognition work in advance by building your\ncredentials and credibility in your district. Before deciding to run, ask\nyourself, \"Why do I want to run for office?\" Take a hard look at what it takes\nto win (qualifications, political circumstances, fundraising metrics, etc.)\nand make an educated decision about whether there\u2019s a real path to victory.  \n  \n **Have a good motivation to run.** When you decide to run, the first thing\neveryone will ask you is \u201cwhy are you running?\u201d And what they mean is, what\nmotivates you to jump into this race specifically? You should be able to\nanswer this question clearly and succinctly, articulating your motivation, how\nit's connected to your community, and why you are the right candidate for this\nmoment. Be sure to run for the right reasons. Don't run to help your insurance\nbusiness or because you feel wronged by your opponent. Run because you have\nskills that can help your community achieve incredible things.  \n  \n **Know how many votes you need to win.** Understanding the math and its\nimpact on a particular race can mean the difference between running in the\nright race and wasting time on an unwinnable one. Vote goals don\u2019t need to be\noverly complicated, but any political campaign worth its salt needs one.\nCreating a vote goal can save you a lot of time campaigning for a race that\nisn't the right fit. Your vote goal should undergird almost everything in your\ncampaign plan, ensuring you spend your time, resources, and people power as\neffectively as possible.  \n  \n **Create a contrast.** Politics is a comparative game. Any political campaign\nstrategy should be predicated on a clear contrast between the candidate and\nanyone else in the field. You need to give voters a reason to choose you, and\nthat reason should be woven throughout your campaign activities. If you don't\noffer voters a choice, they will assume all the candidates are the same and\nmay not be motivated to cast a ballot. Give them the motivation to support\nyou.  \n  \n **Approach your campaign with an equity and inclusion lens.** This is not\njust about engaging voters from different backgrounds, although that's\nessential. It's about living our values as progressives and making equity and\ninclusion more than just transactional concepts. Beyond voter targeting and\noutreach plans, assess your entire campaign through an equity and inclusion\nlens. Think about hiring practices and who makes up your team, ensuring your\npreferences and requirements are clear and inclusive, avoiding accidental\nexclusion. Take the time to weave this into your campaign structure and\nstrategy.  \n  \n **Know that asking people for things is part of a campaign.** Candidates\noften express frustration with soliciting donations, endorsements, and\nsupport. However, if you're a candidate, asking people for things will be a\nsignificant part of your campaign activities. Embrace this reality early on,\nand your campaign will be better off.  \n  \n **Budget for a winning political campaign.** Frequently, campaigns are\nsurprised by the costs and the amount of money needed to run a successful\ncampaign. Do your homework in advance to avoid surprises and make sure you\nhave a viable plan to raise the necessary funds. Work with your team to get a\nreal understanding of what a winning campaign will cost. Ensure your budget\ncovers the expenses of executing your political campaign strategy effectively\nand getting you across the finish line.  \n  \n **Listen more than you talk.** Remember, it\u2019s not about you; it\u2019s about the\nvoters. Take the time to get to know the people you want to represent and what\nmatters to them. You\u2019re running to serve their interests and advocate for\npolicies that will improve their lives\u2014don't lose sight of that as you build\nyour political campaign strategy.  \n  \n **A written plan is key.** Write. It. Down. Seriously. Keep your campaign\nplan written down so that everyone involved knows where to find it and is\ncommitted to implementing it. A well-crafted campaign plan is your road map to\nvictory. While it will evolve over time, having a written plan as a starting\npoint ensures everyone on your campaign team is working toward the same goal\nwith the same basic parameters in place.\n\nQuestions?
