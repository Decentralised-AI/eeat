This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding\nthis feature, allowing visitors to engage with a chatbot by clicking a small\nicon on your site.\n\n## Requirements\n\n  * A website editor (this tutorial uses Wix, but the process can be applied to any website editor).\n  * A chatbot created on CustomGPT.ai.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Open Your Website Editor\n\n  * First, navigate to the editor window of your website. We\u2019ll be using Wix for this demonstration, but you can follow the same steps for other website editors.\n\n### Step 2: Accessing the Embed Options\n\n  * Click on the \u201cAdd Elements\u201d button, usually found in the top left corner of the editor page.\n\n  * Navigate down to the \u201cEmbed Code\u201d tab.\n\n  * Click on the button labeled \u201cEmbed HTML.\u201d\n\n  * A window for embedding the code will pop up. Leave it open for now.\n\n### Step 3: Enable Live Chat on CustomGPT\n\n  * Open a new tab and navigate to CustomGPT.ai.\n  * Go to your \u201cMy Projects\u201d page.\n\n  * Select the chatbot you want to use and click on \u201cProject Settings.\u201d\n\n  * Click on the \u201cSharing\u201d button.\n\n  * Select the tab that says \u201cLive Chat.\u201d\n\n  * Click on \u201cEnable Live Chat.\u201d\n\n  * You\u2019ll now see the other options appear, which you can customize according to your preference. The crucial part here is that you\u2019ve enabled live chat.\n\n### Step 4: Copy the Chatbot Code\n\nYou\u2019ll see a code related to your chatbot. Even though it may look complex,\ndon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not\n\n  *   * Click the copy button, usually located in the top right corner.\n\n  * Return to your website editor.\n\n### Step 5: Paste the Code and Customize\n\n  * Paste the code you just copied into the embed window.\n\n  * Click \u201cUpdate.\u201d\n  * Adjust the size and location of the chatbot icon as needed. Note that the size of the larger box determines the size of the chat window that pops up.\n\n### Step 6: Preview and Publish\n\n  * Click the \u201cPreview\u201d button to see how the chatbot looks on your site.\n\n  * If needed, return to the editor to make adjustments to the size or location of the chatbot.\n  * Once satisfied, click \u201cPublish\u201d to make the chatbot live on your website.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith these simple steps, you\u2019ve added a dynamic and engaging live chat feature\nto your site. Your CustomGPT chatbot is now ready to interact with visitors,\noffering support and information at the click of an icon.
