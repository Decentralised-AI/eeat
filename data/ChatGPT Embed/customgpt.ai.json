This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding\nthis feature, allowing visitors to engage with a chatbot by clicking a small\nicon on your site.\n\n## Requirements\n\n  * A website editor (this tutorial uses Wix, but the process can be applied to any website editor).\n  * A chatbot created on CustomGPT.ai.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Open Your Website Editor\n\n  * First, navigate to the editor window of your website. We\u2019ll be using Wix for this demonstration, but you can follow the same steps for other website editors.\n\n### Step 2: Accessing the Embed Options\n\n  * Click on the \u201cAdd Elements\u201d button, usually found in the top left corner of the editor page.\n\n  * Navigate down to the \u201cEmbed Code\u201d tab.\n\n  * Click on the button labeled \u201cEmbed HTML.\u201d\n\n  * A window for embedding the code will pop up. Leave it open for now.\n\n### Step 3: Enable Live Chat on CustomGPT\n\n  * Open a new tab and navigate to CustomGPT.ai.\n  * Go to your \u201cMy Projects\u201d page.\n\n  * Select the chatbot you want to use and click on \u201cProject Settings.\u201d\n\n  * Click on the \u201cSharing\u201d button.\n\n  * Select the tab that says \u201cLive Chat.\u201d\n\n  * Click on \u201cEnable Live Chat.\u201d\n\n  * You\u2019ll now see the other options appear, which you can customize according to your preference. The crucial part here is that you\u2019ve enabled live chat.\n\n### Step 4: Copy the Chatbot Code\n\nYou\u2019ll see a code related to your chatbot. Even though it may look complex,\ndon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not\n\n  *   * Click the copy button, usually located in the top right corner.\n\n  * Return to your website editor.\n\n### Step 5: Paste the Code and Customize\n\n  * Paste the code you just copied into the embed window.\n\n  * Click \u201cUpdate.\u201d\n  * Adjust the size and location of the chatbot icon as needed. Note that the size of the larger box determines the size of the chat window that pops up.\n\n### Step 6: Preview and Publish\n\n  * Click the \u201cPreview\u201d button to see how the chatbot looks on your site.\n\n  * If needed, return to the editor to make adjustments to the size or location of the chatbot.\n  * Once satisfied, click \u201cPublish\u201d to make the chatbot live on your website.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith these simple steps, you\u2019ve added a dynamic and engaging live chat feature\nto your site. Your CustomGPT chatbot is now ready to interact with visitors,\noffering support and information at the click of an icon.

(for\n\u201cword\u201d limits) or stop responding to queries (for \u201cquery\u201d limits).\n\nWe would suggest signing up to the correct sized plan based on your data and\nquery volume requirements. A good rule of thumb: 10M words is about 50MB of\ndata (your actual words might vary!)\n\n____ Are the \"word\" indexing credits monthly or lifetime?\n\nPlease note: The \u201cword\u201d indexing credits are lifetime, not monthly.  \n\nUnlike traditional systems, indexing and storing \u201cwords\u201d with LLMs (large\nlanguage models) is a very expensive operation and so the \u201cword\u201d limits are\nfor the lifetime of the plan.\n\nThis means that once you reach the limit, you\u2019ve used up your word allowance,\nand the system will stop processing new data on the account (irrespective of\nwhether you have deleted older projects).\n\nThis limit is not renewed every month; it\u2019s for the lifetime of your plan. At\nthat point, you will need to upgrade to a higher plan to add new data indexing\ncapacity.\n\n____ Does it cost anything to add my team?\n\nBasic and Standard plans are best for small teams. Pricing scales up with the\nusage of credits across your account. If you have multiple team members, then\npremium and enterprise plans are better suited to your needs and with these\nyou will receive a higher level of support.\n\n____ What is CustomGPT's refund policy?\n\nWe hold our customers responsible for managing their accounts, credit limits,\nand overages.  \nRefunds are only applicable to the current subscription charge on your\naccount, not for overage  \ncharges from the prior month or additional charges added to your account.\nPlease note that we  \nincur significant charges to index your content and respond to chatbot\nqueries.\n\n____ Is the content from CustomGPT original?\n\nThe content generated by CustomGPT is based on the content indexed in your\nproject + the  \ngeneral language models supported by ChatGPT.\n\n____ What are the available payment methods?\n\nCustomGPT supports all major credit cards and debit cards. We secure your\npayment method  \nusing Stripe for your privacy and protection.  \n  \nCustomGPT does not accept Paypal, prepaid cards, or other cash apps at this\ntime.\n\n____ Where can I read reviews of CustomGPT?\n\nEver since we built CustomGPT (for our own needs actually!), we have been\ninundated with  \nfriends and business colleagues who want their own CustomGPT. Please see the\ntestimonials\n\n____ What's the fastest way to learn how to use CustomGPT?\n\nPlease see our FAQ to get started. Even better: Just ask our CustomGPT chatbot\nin the bottom right corner. This chatbot has indexed all of our business\ncontent. If you still need help, just email hello@customgpt.ai.\n\n____ Does CustomGPT read or write in other languages?\n\nYes, CustomGPT supports 92+ popular languages.\n\n____ Do you have a free trial?\n\nUnfortunately we do not have free trials at this time, but might add free\ntrials in a couple of months.\n\nCurrently, the demand is very heavy and we just dont have the resources to\nsupport free trials. Please feel free to check out our demo or the Livechat in\nthe bottom right of this website.\n\n____ Can I remove the \"Powered by CustomGPT\" Branding?\n\nYes \u2013 you can now white-label and remove the \u201cPowered by CustomGPT\u201d branding\n(requires Premium plan or higher)\n\n#### Contact Us\n\nhello@customgpt.ai\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023\n\nFacebook-f __ Twitter __ Linkedin __ Youtube __\n\n#### Company\n\nAbout Us\n\nBlog\n\nSecurity & Trust\n\nTestimonials\n\nCase Studies\n\nContact Us\n\nAffiliate Program\n\nPricing\n\n#### Tools\n\nLive Demo\n\nUpload PDF\n\nFree Tools\n\nDocumentation\n\nAPI\n\nChatGPT Plugin Builder\n\nMake My Custom Instructions\n\n#### Most Popular\n\n#####  Introducing CustomGPT \u2013 Build Your Own ChatGPT ChatBOT\n\n#####  Exciting News: Upload Your Documents To Your ChatGPT-Powered Chatbot\n\n#####  How To White-Label A Custom ChatGPT Chatbot For Your Clients\n\n#####  How To Build Your Own Personal ChatBOT On Any Topic\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Terms and Conditions\n\nShare on\n\n"
