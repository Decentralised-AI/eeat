The most creative\nbusinesses are adding intelligent chatbots to deliver customer support, funnel\nsales, and even answer FAQs.\n\nFor example, robotics automation provider Formic uses a chatbot to answer\ncustomer questions about their products.\n\nCustomers who land on the web page can ask detailed questions and receive\ndetailed answers instantly. No waiting, no customer loss, no friction.\n\nThe embedded chatbot delivers real value to website visitors.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\n###  **How are businesses adding AI to their online presence?**\n\n **\u200d** A common question small online businesses ask is something along the\nlines of, \"How can I add ChatGPT to my website?\"\n\nThey don\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cHow do I put ChatGPT into my website\u201d. What they\nreally mean is how do I customize ChatGPT with directions, save that\ncustomized version of ChatGPT, and embed it into my website as an interactive\nchatbot?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not that hard. With prompt templates, you can create a guided\nChatGPT experience and embed it onto your website so customers can use it.\nSimilarly, you can embed AI tools into an internal workspace like Notion or\nSharepoint so that co-workers can use the ChatGPT the way you use it.\n\nPickaxe makes it easy to add AI chatbots into any website.\n\nCheck out this website that offers a personal AI writers room for\nbrainstorming, writing, and editing copy.\n\nScreenshot of Inck.ai, a personal AI-powered writing suite\n\nBefore we discuss how to add AI to your website natively, let\u2019s quickly\ndiscuss WHY.\n\n### \u200d **Why should you add AI to your website?**\n\n **\u200d** A lot of small businesses or solopreneurs offer \u201cprofessional\nservices\u201d. This includes all kinds of \u201cknowledge work\u201d like consulting,\nmarketing, coaching, etc. Services that _don\u2019t scale._\n\n _\u200d_ Or at least not historically.\n\nHowever AI, especially Large Language Models like ChatGPT, offer workers to\nability to scale previously unscalable services.\n\nIf you are a marketing consultant who helps clients rewrite their sales\npitches according to your system, you give a lot of the same advice over Zoom\ncalls, email threads, and phone calls. Your time is the limiting factor to\nyour productivity. Since you can\u2019t scale your time, you can\u2019t scale your\nbusiness and serve more customers.\n\nBut with the onset of Large Language Models, now you can. It\u2019s easy to design\na prompt that provides that same expertise you do. By turning transforming\nyour expertise into an interactive chatbot, you can now serve numerous\ncustomers at once.\n\nCustomers' basic needs can be met by your AI chatbot. For more involved needs\nthey still contact you.\n\nYou just outsourced a huge part of your job to your AI chatbot!\n\nDelivering dynamic AI content allows small businesses to scale their services.\nIf you can emulate part of your process with a chatbot, you can serve many\nmore customers simultaneously.\n\n### \u200d **How to embed AI chatbots into your website**\n\n **\u200d** Let\u2019s dive into how to embed an AI chatbot into your website.\n\n#### \u200d **Step 1 - Create a chatbot**\n\n **\u200d** The first step is to create an AI chatbot through Pickaxe. Pickaxe is a\nfree, simple way to create a chatbot that requires no code. You can build\nchatbots in the Pickaxe Chatbot Builder or you can build a widget in The\nPickaxe AI Widget Builder.\n\nMaking a tool is fairly simple. Write a prompt, add user inputs where you want\npeople to insert their own values, and then customize the design. For a more\ndetailed walkthrough, you can watch the how to make a pickaxe tutorial video.\n\nRemember, the art of prompt design is important. The better prompt you write,\nthe better your chatbot will perform. The best practices of designing a\nchatbot are debated, but generally it\u2019s good to follow OpenAI\u2019s GPT Best\nPractices guide.\n\n#### \u200d **Step 2 - Choose Embed Options**\n\n **\u200d** Embedding the chatbot into a website is easy. After you\u2019ve made a\nchatbot on Pickaxe, you can go to a page to manage the pickaxe. Just click the\n\u201cembed\u201d button.  \n\nIn the embed customization page, you can customize the look, design, size, and\nbranding of your AI tool to fit your specifications.\n\n#### \u200d **Step 3 - Paste embed code into your website**\n\n **\u200d** To add the chatbot to your website, just copy and paste the embed code.\nIt\u2019s that easy!\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you\u2019re building your own website, you can embed the chatbot directly into a\nwebsite\u2019s HTML. But Pickaxe also works on no-code website builders like Wix,\nWordpress, Webflow, and more! Users love Pickaxe because the process requires\nno code! Embedding your chatbot is as simple as copy and pasting.\n\nHere\u2019s a walkthrough for most popular website builders and workspaces.\n\n\u200d\n\n### \u200d **How to embed AI chatbots using different website builders**\n\n **\u200d** You can embed AI chatbots into Notion with ease. Just add a new block\nby clicking the \u201c+\u201d button. Scroll down to look for the \u201cEmbed\u201d option. Click\nit and paste in the pickaxe embed link!\n\n\u200d\n\nYou can embed AI tools into Webflow easily as well. It\u2019s as simple as adding\nan \u201cembed element\u201d on the add panel. Then just paste the embed link into the\nbox!\n\nThe embed block on webflow\n\nEmbedding chatbots into Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress, Sharepoint is just as\neasy. Look for adding an element for \"embed code\", dragging it into your\nwebsite, and then pasting in the pickaxe embed code.\n\n**\u200d** Adding AI widgets in a website or workspace is really that simple! Build\na tool, customize the embed, paste in the embed link!\n\nOnce a pickaxe is embedded, it's fast, flexible, and easy to manage. Users can\nalways adjust the prompt and settings without needing to change the embed\ncode. The chatbot will update automatically.\n\n### More Examples of Embedded Pickaxes\n\nAs a final bonus, we want to share two more excellent integrations of AI into\na website.\n\nMike Rosen runs an AI coaching service called Caasper AI.
