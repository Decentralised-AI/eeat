One\nAI response with gpt-4 costs 20 message credits. You can change which model\nyour chatbot uses in the chatbot settings.

Even if it was created using multiple documents.\n\n    * ### How many users can use my chatbot?\n\nIf your chatbot is private, only you have access to it. If you decide to make\nit public, anyone with the link will be able to interact with it.\n\n    * ### When are my message credits renewed?\n\nYour message credits are renewed at the start of every calendar month\nregardless of when you subscribed. So if you subscribe on the 15th of March,\nyour credits will be renewed on the 1st of April.\n\n  *     * ### How do I know how many characters are in my document?\n\nOnce you attach your document(s) for upload, chatbase will show you the\ncharacter count of all the attached documents.\n\n    * ### Can I upload multiple files to one chatbot?\n\nYes, if you have a paid plan you can upload multiple files to one chatbot.\nJust click ctrl (windows) or cmd (mac) and select as many files as you want.\n\n    * ### How much data can I give one chatbot?\n\nFree plan: 400K Characters (~5MB) | Hobby/Standard/Unlimited: 11M Characters\n(~140MB)\n\n    * ### How does the unlimited plan work?\n\nYou get 40,000 message credits included in the plan when you subscribe.
