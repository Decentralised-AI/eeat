With\nAista it's a 5 minute job now. Zero code required!\n\nchatgpt\n\nWe have significantly simplified the process of creating and embedding a\ncustom ChatGPT chatbot on your website, to the point where it almost doesn't\nrequire any technical skills at all. Watch the following video for a\ndemonstration.\n\nThe process is almost reduced down to 3 to 4 button clicks now, yet still\nproviding the same level of security. And the chatbot displays images if the\nwebsite you scrape has images. The process is based upon a wizard, that guides\nyou through creating your OpenAI API key, creating a reCAPTCHA account, and\nscrapes and creates a custom machine learning model from a simple URL.\nPreviously you had to mess around with several menu items, and complex\nconstructs. Now it's a simple wizard asking you three simple questions;\n\n  * OpenAI API key?\n  * reCAPTCHA site-key and secret?\n  * Website URL\n\nOnce you've provide the above, our Machine Learning components will do the\nrest 100% automatically for you. You can still customise your machine learning\ndata using the machine learning component, but the above should significantly\nsimplify things for you.\n\nOur latest release also fixes a lot of other issues. For instance the previous\nversion couldn't be used to _\"spice\"_ up models with Amazon pages because of\nthe way Amazon was serving content as GZipped. This version fixes that, in\naddition to dozens of other issues related to our chatbot technology. If you\nexperienced problems when spicing up your model, you might want to try again.\n\nIn addition all our themes are now applying CSS settings as important. This\nshould fix UI issues where you have global settings somehow overriding your\nchatbot UI. We also provide better error feedback now. If OpenAI is down, the\nchatbot will inform you about that. If you want to read more about our chatbot\ntechnology, you can find more information here. If you're still uncertain\nabout how to embed your custom ChatGPT chatbot on your website, you can\ncontact us and we'll help you out.\n\nI want to emphasise that when our machine learning experts creates a custom\nchatbot, we're doing much more than what's illustrated in the above video.\nWe'll go through your training data, _\"washing\"_ it, and ask your chatbot 50\nto 100 questions to sanity check it. If it answers incorrectly, we'll manually\nadd training data specific to your business in accordance to your websites,\netc, etc, etc. By using the above wizard, you can typically acquire 85%\naccuracy. Once we get to work, we can typically increase that number to 98%\n...\n\nThomas Hansen is the CEO of AISTA, an AI and Machine Learning Low-Code\nsoftware development company helping enterprises achieve their goals.

There are 3 basic prices now\nfor our bots. These are as follows;\n\n  * Basic package is \u20ac70 per month\n  * Professional package is \u20ac283 per month\n  * Enterprise package is \u20ac1,140 per month\n\nIf you chose to pay for a year in advance, we throw in 30% discount, resulting\nin the following prices.\n\n  * Basic package is \u20ac49 per month\n  * Professional package is \u20ac198 per month\n  * Enterprise package is \u20ac798 per month\n\nThe basic package is for personal usage, and small companies with no more than\n3-4 employees not actively using their websites in marketing and selling their\nservices. The professional package is for medium sized companies using their\nwebsite for marketing and sales purposes. The enterprise package is for larger\ncompanies with multiple websites, needing chatbots on multiple sites.\n\nWe can also help you setup the chatbot on your website for an additional fee\nof \u20ac498, being a one time setup fee. However, if you can manage everything\nyourself, and you've got a small website, and you're willing to pay up front\nfor a year ahead - You can get a custom ChatCPT chatbot on your website for\n\u20ac49 per month as of from today.\n\nHopefully this will give also the little man, and the mom'n'pop stores of the\nworld the ability to put a custom ChatGPT chatbot on their website. We care\nabout the mom'n'pop stores of the world. This is literally our own background\nand origins, so it gives us great pleasure providing you with a product that\nallows you to afford putting your own custom ChatGPT chatbot on your website.\n\nThomas Hansen is the CEO of AISTA, an AI and Machine Learning Low-Code\nsoftware development company helping enterprises achieve their goals.
