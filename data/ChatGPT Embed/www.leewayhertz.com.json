data and improve their performance over time without being\nexplicitly programmed. Although machine learning is a vast field with all its\ncomponents bearing special significance in its working, the importance of\nembeddings cannot be overemphasized.\n\nMachine learning has brought about revolutionary transformations in the field\nof artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn and enhance their\nabilities through data, without the need for explicit programming. And in the\nvast realm of machine learning, where different technical components come\ntogether to build ingenious solutions and applications, embeddings hold a\ncrucial place and their significance cannot be overstated.\n\nEmbeddings are mathematical representations of data that capture meaningful\nrelationships between entities. Embeddings have become an indispensable part\nof a data scientist\u2019s toolkit and have dramatically changed how natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), computer vision, and recommender systems work.\n\nDespite their widespread use, many data scientists find embeddings archaic and\nconfusing. Many more use them blindly without understanding what they are.\nHowever, understanding embeddings is crucial for anyone working in the field\nof machine learning, especially in NLP. According to a recent report by\nOpenAI, language models like GPT-3 that utilize embeddings have the ability to\nperform a wide range of natural language tasks, including language\ntranslation, question answering, and language generation.\n\nIn this article, we will dive deep into what embeddings are, how they work,\nand how they are often operationalized in real-world systems. We will explore\nthe different types of embeddings, including text and image embedding. We will\nalso examine popular embedding models like Word2Vec, PCA, SVD and BERT.\nAdditionally, we will discuss the role of embeddings in ChatGPT-like models,\nwhich are some of the most advanced language models available today.\n\nBy the end of this article, you will better understand the importance of\nembeddings in machine learning and their significant impact on natural\nlanguage processing. So, let\u2019s dive in and explore machine learning\nembeddings.\n\n  * What are embeddings?\n  * How are embeddings stored and accessed?\n  * Importance of embeddings\n  * Types of embeddings\n  * Common embedding models\n  * Various applications of embeddings\n  * How do embeddings work in a ChatGPT-like model?\n  * How to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings in an LLM like ChatGPT?\n\n## What are embeddings?\n\nAn embedding is a way of representing complex information, like text or\nimages, using a set of numbers. It works by translating high-dimensional\nvectors into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to work with large\ninputs. The process involves capturing the semantic meaning of the input and\nplacing similar inputs close together in the embedding space, allowing for\neasy comparison and analysis of the information.\n\nOne of the main benefits of using embeddings is that they can be learned and\nreused across models. This means that once an embedding is created, it can be\napplied to various applications, like text classification, sentiment analysis,\nor image recognition. For instance, if we have a sentence, \u201cWhat is the main\nbenefit of voting?\u201d We can represent it in a vector space with a set of\nnumbers. These numbers represent the meaning of the sentence and can be used\nto compare it to other sentences. By calculating the distance between\ndifferent embeddings, we can determine how similar the meaning of two\nsentences is.\n\nEmbeddings are not limited to text. They can also be used to represent images\nby creating a list of numbers that describe the image\u2019s features which can\nthen be compared to text embeddings to determine if a sentence accurately\ndescribes the image.\n\nEmbeddings are an incredibly useful tool in machine learning, especially when\ncombined with collaborative filtering to create recommendation systems. By\nrepresenting data as embeddings, we can simplify the training and prediction\nprocess while also improving model performance. In particular, item similarity\nuse cases have benefited greatly from embeddings, helping to create more\neffective and accurate recommendation systems. Embeddings are an essential\ntool in the field of machine learning and are utilized in various data-driven\nindustries. They allow the representation of high-dimensional data in a lower-\ndimensional space, which makes it possible to capture the underlying\nrelationships between data points. Embeddings are widely used for applications\nsuch as natural language processing, image recognition, and recommender\nsystems. Their ability to efficiently represent complex data structures in a\nsimplified format has made them a critical component in the development of\nmodern machine learning algorithms.\n\n## How are embeddings stored and accessed?\n\nEmbeddings represent data in machine learning applications, but how are they\nstored and accessed? This is where the concept of a vector store comes into\nplay. A vector store is a type of data structure that allows embeddings to be\nefficiently stored and accessed. By storing embeddings as vectors, we can\nperform vector operations such as cosine similarity and vector addition, which\ncan be useful in many machine-learning tasks. For example, in natural language\nprocessing, we can use vector stores to represent words as embeddings and\nperform tasks such as semantic similarity and word analogies.\n\nTo understand how vector stores work, it\u2019s helpful to consider how embeddings\nare created first.\n\nBefore we can create embeddings from text, we need to process the text to\nprepare it for modeling. One common text processing technique is dividing the\ntext into smaller pieces called chunks. These chunks can be sentences,\nparagraphs, or even smaller units such as words. Once the text has been\ndivided into chunks, we can create embeddings for each chunk using neural\nnetwork models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. These models learn to map\nwords to high-dimensional vectors based on their co-occurrence patterns in\nlarge text corpora. For example, words that appear in similar contexts (e.g.,\n\u201cking\u201d and \u201cqueen\u201d) are assigned similar vectors, while words with different\nmeanings (e.g., \u201cking\u201d and \u201ccar\u201d) are assigned different vectors. These\nembeddings capture the semantic and syntactic properties of the text in each\nchunk, which can be useful in various machine-learning tasks.\n\nChunks are particularly useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis or named\nentity recognition, where we want to classify individual parts of a text\nrather than the entire text. By processing the text in chunks, we can obtain\nmore fine-grained information about the text and improve the accuracy of our\nmodels.\n\nOnce the embeddings have been generated, they are stored in the vector store,\nessentially a database that stores the embeddings as high-dimensional vectors,\nwith each vector corresponding to a specific word. When we want to perform any\noperation on the embeddings, such as finding the most similar words to a given\nword or computing the vector representation of a sentence, we can retrieve the\nappropriate vectors from the vector store. This is typically done using a key-\nvalue lookup, where the word is used as the key, and the corresponding\nembedding vector is returned as the value.\n\nOne advantage of using vector stores is that they enable fast and efficient\nvector operations, such as computing the cosine similarity between two\nembeddings or performing vector addition and subtraction. These operations can\nbe useful in various machine-learning tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text\nclassification, and language translation.\n\n## Importance of embeddings\n\nEmbeddings play a crucial role in the functioning of transformers.\nTransformers are an essential concept to understand when discussing platforms\nlike ChatGPT that are based on language transformers. These models possess\nunique properties that differentiate them from other machine learning models.\nUnlike other models that produce static and immutable weights, transformers\nhave soft weights that can be changed at runtime, similar to a dynamically-\ntyped programming language\u2019s REPL ( read\u2013eval\u2013print loop). Embeddings in the\ntransformer model create a new layer of lower dimensionality that gives\ncadence to much larger high-dimensional vectors, allowing for more nuanced\ndata analysis and can improve a model\u2019s ability to classify and interpret\nhuman language.\n\nDimensionality, in this context, refers to the shape of the data. Embeddings\ncan enhance a model\u2019s ability to analyze complex data by creating a low-\ndimensional space to represent high-dimensional vectors. In essence,\nembeddings are a crucial tool for improving the performance of soft weight\nmodels like transformers, making them a powerful technique for natural\nlanguage processing and other machine learning applications.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why embeddings are important:\n\n  * **Semantic representation:** Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the input data, allowing for easy comparison and analysis. This can improve the performance of many natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis and text classification.\n  * **Lower dimensionality:** Embeddings create a lower-dimensional space to represent high-dimensional vectors, which makes it easier to work with large inputs and reduces the computational complexity of many machine learning algorithms.\n  * **Reusability:** Once an embedding is created, it can be used across multiple models and applications, making it a powerful and efficient technique for data analysis.  \nRobustness: Embeddings can be trained on large datasets and capture the\nunderlying patterns and relationships in the data, making them robust and\neffective for many industry applications.\n\n##  Launch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLeverage our expertise in building ChatGPT-like solutions using embeddings\n\nLearn More\n\n## Types of embeddings\n\nWhen it comes to producing embeddings in a deep neural network, many different\nstrategies are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The\nchoice of strategy depends entirely on the purpose of the embeddings and what\nkind of data is being used. Whether it\u2019s through recurrent neural networks,\nconvolutional neural networks, or some other method, the right strategy can\nmake all the difference in creating high-quality embeddings that accurately\ncapture the underlying semantic meaning of the data.\n\n### Text embedding\n\nText embedding is a technique to convert a string of characters into a vector\nof real numbers. This process creates a space for the text to be embedded,\nreferred to as an \u201cembedding.\u201d Text embedding is closely related to text\nencoding, which converts plain text into tokens. In sentiment analysis, the\ntext embedding block is integrated with the datasets view\u2019s text encoding. It\nis important to note that the text embedding block can only be used following\nan input block that requires the selection of a text-encoded feature.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to ensure that the language model chosen matches\nthe language model selected during text encoding. Several models, such as\nNNLM, GloVe, ELMo, and Word2vec, are designed to learn word embeddings, which\nare featured vectors for each real-valued word.\n\n### Image embedding\n\nImage embedding is a process that involves analyzing images and generating\nnumerical vectors that capture the features and characteristics of the image.\nThis is typically done using deep learning algorithms, which have the ability\nto extract features from the image and convert them into a vector\nrepresentation. This vector representation can be used to perform various\ntasks such as image search, object recognition, and image classification.\n\nVarious image embedding techniques are available, each of which has been\ndesigned for a specific task. Some embedding techniques require the images to\nbe uploaded to a remote server for processing, while others can be performed\nlocally on the user\u2019s computer. The SqueezeNet embedder is an example of a\ntechnique that can be run locally and is particularly useful for quick image\nreviews without an internet connection.\n\n## Common embedding models\n\n### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a type of embedding model commonly used\nin machine learning and data analysis. PCA is a technique for reducing the\ndimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of the original\ninformation as possible. It works by finding a set of linearly uncorrelated\nvariables, known as principal components, that capture the maximum amount of\nvariation in the data. These principal components can be considered a lower-\ndimensional representation of the original data and can be used as input\nfeatures for a machine learning algorithm. PCA is a powerful tool for\nvisualizing and exploring high-dimensional datasets and can be used in a wide\nrange of applications, including image and text analysis, data compression,\nand feature extraction.\n\n### SVD\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique that is widely\nused in many fields, including machine learning and data science. It is a\nmatrix factorization method that decomposes a matrix into two smaller\nmatrices, allowing for a reduction in the number of features or dimensions in\na dataset, known as dimensionality reduction.\n\nSVD is commonly applied to a matrix that contains information about user\nratings for different items, such as movies, books, or products. In this case,\nthe matrix is decomposed into two smaller matrices, known as embeddings. One\nmatrix represents users, and the other represents items. These embeddings\ncapture the relationships between users and items in the dataset. For example,\nif a user frequently rates horror movies highly, their embedding will be\ncloser to the embedding for horror movies than to the embedding for romantic\ncomedies. Similarly, if two movies have similar embeddings, they may be\nrecommended to the same user.\n\nBy multiplying these embeddings, we can predict user ratings for items by\ntaking the dot product of the user embedding and the item embedding, giving a\npredicted rating for that item. The higher the dot product, the higher the\npredicted rating.\n\n### Word2Vec\n\nWord2Vec is a computer program that can help understand how words are related\nto each other. It does this by turning each word into a special code called an\n\u201cembedding.\u201d\n\nTo create these embeddings, Word2Vec looks at how often words appear together\nin sentences. It then uses this information to guess what other words should\nappear in the same sentence, which is like a game of charades where you have\nto guess what word your friend is thinking of based on the words they use to\ndescribe it. Once Word2Vec has made these guesses, it uses them to create the\nembeddings. Words that are often used together will have similar embeddings.\nFor example, \u201cking\u201d and \u201cqueen\u201d will have similar embeddings because they are\noften used together in sentences. These embeddings can be used to create\nanalogies. For example, we can use the embeddings to answer the question,\n\u201cWhat word is to \u2018man\u2019 as \u2018queen\u2019 is to \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d The answer is \u201cking.\u201d\n\nOverall, Word2Vec is a useful tool for understanding how words relate to each\nother. Its embeddings can be used to create analogies and help computer\nprograms better understand human language.\n\n### BERT\n\nBERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers. It\u2019s a\nspecial computer program that can understand human language.\n\nBERT is better than older language programs like Word2Vec because it goes\nthrough two stages of training. First, BERT studies a lot of text from places\nlike Wikipedia to learn how words relate to each other. Then, it goes through\na second stage of training where it is taught to understand a specific type of\ntext, like medical articles. What makes BERT special is its ability to pay\nattention to the context of words. For example, BERT can tell that \u201cplay\u201d in\n\u201cLet\u2019s play a game\u201d is different from \u201cplay\u201d in \u201cI\u2019m going to see a play\ntonight.\u201d BERT does this by considering the words that come before and after\neach word it analyzes.\n\nOverall, BERT is good at understanding language and predicting what comes next\nin a sentence. This makes it a popular tool for computer programs that need to\nunderstand and generate human-like text.\n\n## Various applications of embeddings\n\nEmbeddings have transcended their initial use in research and have become a\ncrucial component of real-world machine-learning applications. They are widely\nemployed in various fields, including Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nrecommender systems, and computer vision. By enabling the efficient\nrepresentation of data in a low-dimensional space, embeddings have improved\nthe performance of many machine learning models in various real-world\napplications. For instance, embeddings have been utilized to improve search\nengines, power voice assistants, and enhance image recognition systems.\n\n### Recommender systems\n\nIn a recommender system, the goal is to predict user preferences and ratings\nfor various products or entities. Two common approaches to recommender systems\nare collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative\nfiltering involves using user actions to train and generate recommendations.\nModern collaborative filtering systems often use embeddings, such as the SVD\nmethod described earlier, to build a relationship between users and products.\nBy multiplying a user embedding by an item embedding, a rating prediction is\ngenerated, allowing similar items to be recommended to similar users.\nEmbeddings can also be used in downstream models, such as YouTube\u2019s\nrecommender system, which uses embeddings as inputs to a neural network that\npredicts watch time.\n\n### Semantic search\n\nTo provide more accurate search results, BERT-based embeddings take into\naccount the context and meaning of words, enabling search engines to\nunderstand the nuances of language and provide better results. For example,\nwhen searching for \u201cHow to make pizza,\u201d a semantic search engine using BERT\nwould understand that the user is looking for instructions on making pizza,\nnot just general information about pizza. This improves the relevance and\naccuracy of search results, leading to a better user experience.\n\n### Computer vision\n\nIn computer vision, embeddings are crucial in bridging the gap between\ndifferent contexts. In practical applications like self-driving cars, images\ncan be transformed into embeddings and used to make decisions based on the\nembedded context. This enables transfer learning, allowing models to be\ntrained using generated images from video games instead of expensive, real-\nworld images. Tesla is already utilizing this technique. Another interesting\nexample is the AI Art Machine, which can generate an image based on user input\ntext. By transforming text and an image into embeddings in the same latent\nspace, we can translate between the two using embeddings as an intermediate\nrepresentation. With this approach, it is possible to go from text to image\nand vice versa using multiple transformations, such as Image -> Embedding,\nText -> Embedding, Embedding -> Text, and Image -> Text.\n\n## How do embeddings work in a ChatGPT-like model?\n\nChatGPT, like all language models, uses a combination of natural language\nprocessing techniques and machine learning to generate text. When you prompt\nChatGPT with a command like \u201cWrite me a poem about cats,\u201d the text is first\ntokenized into individual units, which in this case might include \u201cWrite,\u201d\n\u201cme,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201cpoem,\u201d \u201cabout\u201d and \u201ccats.\u201d\n\nBecause computers cannot directly understand text, the tokenized text is then\nconverted into embeddings. These embeddings are created by training a neural\nnetwork to predict the context of a given word or phrase based on the context\nof surrounding words or phrases. Embeddings make it easier for the model to\ncompare and relate different words or phrases, as semantically similar words\nare turned into similar lists of numbers.\n\nChatGPT is a type of causal language model that predicts the next token in a\nsequence based on all previous tokens. To do this, ChatGPT uses a transformer\narchitecture. Transformers are a type of neural network that excels at\nprocessing data sequences, such as text. Transformers work by using a\nmechanism called attention to identify which words in the prompt to pay\nattention to in order to generate a response. During training, the transformer\nlayers are fed gigabytes of text data so they can learn the correct\nassociations between different tokens. This training process can take\nthousands of GPUs and several months to complete.\n\nWhen making a prediction, the transformer layers take the input embeddings and\npass them through a series of computations to generate the correct output\nembeddings. The output embeddings are then converted back into text tokens,\nwhich can be presented as the model\u2019s response. Because ChatGPT predicts one\ntoken at a time, it generates text word by word rather than all at once. To\ngenerate longer pieces of text, ChatGPT uses an autoregressive approach. After\npredicting a token, it adds that token back to the prompt and feeds the\nupdated prompt back into the model to generate the next token. This process is\nrepeated until the model outputs a special \u201cstop\u201d token, which indicates that\nit has finished generating text.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s embeddings play a crucial role in ChatGPT. When a user inputs a\nprompt or a question, ChatGPT turns the text into tokens, which are then\nturned into embeddings. OpenAI\u2019s language models use a neural network\narchitecture called transformers to generate these embeddings. These\nembeddings are essentially numerical representations of the text, where\nsemantically similar words have similar numerical values. The embeddings are\nthen passed through multiple transformer layers, which are trained to identify\nwhich words to pay attention to in order to generate a response. The output of\neach transformer layer is a new set of embeddings, which is then fed into the\nnext transformer layer. This process continues until the final transformer\nlayer outputs a special token called a stop token, indicating that the\nresponse is complete.\n\nTo explain more, embeddings in ChatGPT are used to represent text as high-\ndimensional numerical vectors. These embeddings capture the semantic and\nsyntactic meaning of the text and are crucial for training the neural network\nto generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n\nTo apply embeddings in ChatGPT, you would typically use a pre-trained language\nmodel, such as GPT-2 or GPT-3, that has already been trained on a large corpus\nof text data. You would then input your prompt or question into the model,\nwhich would tokenize the text into individual units, convert these units into\nembeddings, and then use them to generate a response.\n\n##  Launch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLeverage our expertise in building ChatGPT-like solutions using embeddings\n\nLearn More\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how this might work in practice:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to use ChatGPT to generate a response to the prompt \u201cTell\nme a joke about cats.\u201d The first step is to tokenize the text into individual\nunits:\n\n[\u201cTell\u201d, \u201cme\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201cjoke\u201d, \u201cabout\u201d, \u201ccats\u201d]\n\nNext, each token is converted into an embedding using the pre-trained language\nmodel:\n\n[0.23, -0.12, 0.54, \u2026, 0.76] (embedding for \u201cTell\u201d) [0.45, 0.21, -0.34, \u2026,\n0.09] (embedding for \u201cme\u201d) [0.67, -0.09, 0.81, \u2026, -0.56] (embedding for \u201ca\u201d)\n[-0.87, 0.76, 0.12, \u2026, 0.43] (embedding for \u201cjoke\u201d) [0.56, 0.34, -0.21, \u2026,\n-0.09] (embedding for \u201cabout\u201d) [0.76, -0.56, -0.34, \u2026, 0.21] (embedding for\n\u201ccats\u201d)\n\nThese embeddings are then passed through multiple transformer layers, which\nuse attention mechanisms to identify which words to focus on to generate a\nresponse. Finally, the output of the transformer layers is converted back into\ntext, resulting in a generated response:\n\n\u201cWhy was the cat afraid of the tree? Because it was afraid of getting treed!\u201d\n\nIn this example, the pre-trained language model has been able to generate a\nhumorous response that is contextually relevant to the user\u2019s prompt about\ncats. The embeddings have played a crucial role in allowing the model to\nunderstand the meaning of the text and generate a coherent response.\n\n## How to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings in an LLM like ChatGPT?\n\nStoring and retrieving embeddings can be a challenge, especially when dealing\nwith large datasets. One solution to this problem is using the Llama index, a\ndata structure that enables fast and efficient nearest-neighbor search in\nhigh-dimensional spaces.\n\nThe Llama index is designed to work with embeddings and other high-dimensional\nvectors, allowing for fast retrieval of similar vectors based on similarity\nmeasures such as cosine similarity. By efficiently indexing the embeddings\nusing the Llama Index, we can quickly search through large datasets and find\nthe most similar vectors to a given query vector.\n\nIn the context of natural language processing, the Llama index can be used to\nfind the most similar words or phrases to a given query word or phrase. This\ncan be useful in various applications, such as recommendation systems, search\nengines, and text classification. It works by dividing the high-dimensional\nspace into smaller cells or buckets, each containing a subset of the vectors.\nThe cells are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with each level of the\nhierarchy having a smaller set of cells that represent a more refined\npartitioning of the space.\n\nThe Llama index employs a technique known as product quantization, which\ndivides the high-dimensional vector into multiple low-dimensional subvectors,\neach of which is quantized to a finite number of values. The quantized\nsubvectors are then used to identify the cells the vector belongs to, allowing\nfor a fast and efficient lookup of similar vectors.\n\nOne of the main benefits of the Llama Index is its ability to perform fast and\naccurate nearest-neighbor searches, which is useful in various machine\nlearning applications. In ChatGPT, for example, the Llama index is used to\nfind the most similar context vectors to a given input text, allowing the\nmodel to generate more relevant and coherent responses.\n\nAnother benefit of the Llama index is its scalability, as it can handle large\ndatasets with millions or even billions of vectors. This makes it well-suited\nfor applications that involve processing large amounts of text data, such as\nnatural language understanding and sentiment analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the Llama index can reduce the embeddings\u2019 memory footprint by\nstoring only a subset of the vectors in memory and retrieving the rest on\ndemand. This can significantly reduce the memory requirements of machine\nlearning models that rely on embeddings.\n\n## Endnote\n\nEmbeddings have become crucial to various machine learning models, including\nrecommendation algorithms, language transformers, and classification models.\nThey are essentially high-dimensional numerical representations of words that\ncapture the meaning and context of the text, making it easier for models to\ninterpret and analyze language.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s embedding implementation is particularly useful for the ChatGPT\nmodel. Using embeddings, ChatGPT can easily understand the relationships\nbetween different words and categories rather than just analyzing each word in\nisolation, allowing the model to generate more coherent and contextually\nrelevant responses to user prompts and questions.\n\nOverall, embeddings are a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and\nefficiency of machine learning models, enabling them to better capture the\nnuances and complexities of language, leading to more accurate predictions and\nhighly effective algorithms. As machine learning advances, we can expect\nembeddings to play an increasingly important role in developing new and\ninnovative applications.\n\n_Ready to leverage the power of embeddings for your project?Contact us today\nto learn how we can help you create high-quality embeddings that capture the\nrelationships between words in your dataset._\n\n**Listen to the article**\n\nWhat is Chainlink VRF\n\nWhat is Chainlink VRF\n\nWhat is Chainlink VRF\n\n<iframe\nsrc='https://www.leewayhertz.com?action=embed_zoomsounds&type=player&margs=eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvZDNsa2MzbjV0aDAxeDcuY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXRcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzIwMjNcLzA0XC8yNzAwMzQwMVwvV2hhdC1yb2xlLWRvLWVtYmVkZGluZ3MtcGxheS1pbi1hLUNoYXRHUFQtbGlrZS1tb2RlbF8ubXAzIiwidHlwZSI6ImRldGVjdCIsImFydGlzdG5hbWUiOiIiLCJkenNhcF9tZXRhX3NvdXJjZV9hdHRhY2htZW50X2lkIjoiNjI1NjQiLCJwbGF5X2luX2Zvb3Rlcl9wbGF5ZXIiOiJkZWZhdWx0IiwiZW5hYmxlX2Rvd25sb2FkX2J1dHRvbiI6Im9mZiIsImRvd25sb2FkX2N1c3RvbV9saW5rX2VuYWJsZSI6Im9mZiIsIm9wZW5faW5fdWx0aWJveCI6Im9mZiJ9'\nstyle='overflow:hidden; transition: height 0.3s ease-out;' width='100%'\nheight='180' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'></iframe>\n\n#### Author\u2019s Bio\n\n\n\nAkash Takyar\n\nCEO LeewayHertz\n\nAkash Takyar is the founder and CEO at LeewayHertz.
