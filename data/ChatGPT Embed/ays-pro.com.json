Incredible,\nisn\u2019t it?\n\nThe special question builder integration for the Quiz Maker plugin is not the\nonly magic that the ChatGPT AI Assistant can show us. The ChatGPT AI Chatbot\nis here to impress your website visitors with well-written answers to their\nquestions based on the information on your website. If they have questions\nconcerning your product, there is no need for searching for the data on your\nwebsite. They just can click on the Chat window and ask their question and the\nchatbot will answer them immediately.\n\nThe **Embedding feature** for the ChatGPT AI Assistant plugin is here to\nchange the AI game. You are free to \u201cteach\u201d the plugin all the needed data and\nthen just watch how perfectly it will use all the provided data. While using\nthis feature you will be able to implement a 24/7 support chat support that\ncan quickly respond to your website visitors\u2019 inquiries without requiring any\nhuman staff.\n\nThe Embedding feature is the best way to reduce the number of emails in your\nsupport inbox. All the **pre-sale questions** can be answered via this\nChatbot.\n\nIn this step-by-step guide, you will learn how you can reach the specific\nresult for your WordPress website using the game-changing ChatGPT Chatbot\nplugin.\n\n  \n\n## The Advantages of the Embedding Feature: How it can replace a Support\nSpecialist\n\n  \n\nAs said at the beginning of the article, the Embedding feature can easily\nreplace a Support Specialist. We know that it sounds rude, but this feature is\nnot here to replace the actual humans but to make their work easier. No\noverloaded inboxes for the Support Specialist. Users who have technical issues\nwill receive their support faster than before, as the Chatbot will answer all\nthe pre-sales questions and all the Support Specialist will do is pay their\nattention to those, who are facing issues that cannot be solved with the help\nof the AI.\n\nThe main advantages of the ChatGPT Embedding features can be:\n\n  * **24/7 Availability:** From all over the world, at any time, website visitors can find the answers to their questions based on your website\u2019s info. If someone decides to buy your product but is not able to find whether you have the needed feature or not, they can just ask the chatbot and get the questions, so no need to wait for hours to receive a reply from your Support Specialists. \n  * **Rapid Learning and Adaptation:** AI is known to rapidly change and adapt. Whether we want to admit it or not, humans still are not able to learn and adapt as rapidly as AI can. So, no matter how difficult the content is, it is ready to learn within a short period of time and adapt the answers based on it. \n  * **Multilingual Support:** ChatGPT AI chatbot has the capability to provide answers in various languages. It will allow you to accommodate a varied customer base without requiring specialists for language-specific assistance. \n  * **Cost-Efficiency:** The AI chatbot doesn\u2019t need any salaries, benefits, or training expenses, but Support Specialist will indeed need them. This feature enables you to minimize support costs while upholding excellent customer service. \n\nThe above-mentioned points aren\u2019t the all advantages of the ChatGPT AI\nAssistant plugin but just a small part of it. As it can be used for all kinds\nof websites we are not able to mention all the profits it can provide. All you\nneed to do is just try it on your own and find your list of advantages.\n\n  \n\n## Step-by-Step Tutorial for Embedding\n\n  \n\nNow, if we already know the advantages of the embedding feature, let\u2019s see how\nactually it works and how it can be activated.\n\nFor the first step, of course, you will need to install and activate the Pro\nVersion of the  ChatGPT AI Chatbot plugin. After it, you will see the\nEmbeddings submenu. For activating this option, you will need to enable the\n**\u201cEnable Content Embedding\u201d** option.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nBut for using this feature another platform is needed, and it is **Pinecone**.\n\nSo first of all create a Pinecone account. You can create your account using\nyour Gmail.\n\nFor activating the feature two factors are needed index and API keys. As it\nwas shown in the image above, you will need to move to the appropriate\nsubmenus and create the indexes and API keys.\n\nFor creating the Index, all you need to do is to click on the **\u201cCreate\nIndex\u201d** button. Add the needed information and make sure to set your\ndimension to **1536** and metric to **cosine.**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNow it\u2019s time to create the API Keys. Again move to the particular tab and\nclick on the **\u201cCreate API Key\u201d** button.\n\n  \n\nSo, for now, everything is done in the Pinecone. Copy the Index and API Key\nand let\u2019s go back to the ChatGPT Chatbot plugin.\n\nAs you may remember, for enabling the embedding feature we have activated the\n**\u201cEnable Content Embedding\u201d** option. So, right after activating it you will\nsee a field where you can insert the index and API Key. And after that, just\nclick on the **\u201cConnect\u201d** button.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nSo, in case the connection is done as it should be, let\u2019s choose what we\nexactly want to \u201cteach\u201d to the plugin. There you will be able to choose among\nthe posts and pages. By clicking on these options you will choose whether the\nplugin must learn the information from the posts and pages. By ticking on each\noption all the material included in them and then provide answers based on\nthem. In case you choose the exact post or page, the plugin will learn the\nparticular page/post only.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThese simple steps are enough for you to activate the plugin and be sure that\nyour website visitors are now able to find the answers to their questions\nconcerning your website.\n\nAnd for the final step, if you want to see what page/posts are embedded in the\nplugin just move to the Embeddings submenu and see posts and used token costs.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n## Wrapping Up!\n\n  \n\nTo wrap up the following step-by-step guide the new embedding feature is a\ngreat option for you to not only engage the website visitors but also provide\nthem the ability to get the answers to their questions immediately. Get the\nChatGPT AI Assistant plugin and follow all the trends of the AI world.\n\nThe plugin is continuously updating, which means new features will be added\nsoon.
