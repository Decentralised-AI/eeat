with Urinary Incontinence\n\nMany women lose bladder control with age or pregnancies, yet few seek help.\nLearn which treatment options may work for you.\n\nContributor\n\n### Savitha Krishnan, M.D.\n\nPalo Alto Medical Foundation\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the estimated 17 million American women who suffer from\nurinary incontinence, feelings of shame, embarrassment and isolation may\ncompel you to suffer in silence. However, a growing number of treatments and\ntherapies can help improve your symptoms and restore your quality of life \u2013\neven if you\u2019ve previously had an unsuccessful procedure. According to the\nAmerican Urogynecologic Society, 80 to 90 percent of women who seek treatment\nfor urinary incontinence experience significant improvement.\n\n\u201cMany patients ask me if urinary incontinence is a normal part of aging,\u201d says\nSavitha Krishnan, M.D., a urogynecologist with the Palo Alto Medical\nFoundation. \u201cAnd it does become more common as women age. But now the\ninterventions are less invasive and the success rate higher than ever before,\nso it\u2019s worthwhile to explore solutions with your doctor no matter what your\nprior experience or your age.\u201d\n\n\n\n## Understanding Incontinence\n\nIncontinence not caused by illness or injury typically falls into three\ncategories: stress, urge and mixed. Determining which type you have is the\nfirst step in determining the right treatment.\n\n  * Stress urinary incontinence involves the involuntary or accidental loss of urine during activities that increase internal abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercise or lifting. Stress urinary incontinence is usually related to weakened pelvic floor muscles, the muscular hammock that sits between the pubic bone and the tail bone and functions to support the pelvic organs (bladder, uterus, rectum), as well as increase sexual pleasure and stabilize the body\u2019s core. In younger women, the main cause of stress urinary incontinence is vaginal childbirth. Certain surgeries and anatomic abnormalities can also play a part, as well as normal deterioration of the muscles as women age. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of women of all ages have stress urinary incontinence.\n  * Urge incontinence is a sudden, strong feeling of needing to urinate caused by overactive and uncontrolled contractions of the bladder. This urge is often accompanied by the involuntary leaking of urine, ranging from a small amount to the complete emptying of the bladder. A number of situations can serve as triggers: the sound of running water; actions such as putting the key in the door or walking by a bathroom; or consumption of certain foods and beverages such caffeinated drinks or citrus juices. The prevalence of urge incontinence increases with age and the loss of estrogen, affecting approximately 15 percent of women in their 50s, and increasing to about 50 percent of women in their 70s and 80s, according to Dr. Krishnan.\n  * If you have symptoms of both stress and urge urinary incontinence, you have mixed urinary incontinence.\n\n## Preventing Incontinence\n\nAlthough there is no magic formula to prevent incontinence \u2013 especially since\nthe causes range from genetics to natural aging to childbirth \u2013 there are a\nfew things you can do to reduce your chances of developing the problem, or to\nlimit symptoms.\n\n  * **Pelvic exercises** \u2013 A large study of Japanese women has shown that younger women who do pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) after vaginal childbirth (and continuing) have more success preventing stress incontinence, Dr. Krishnan says. Older women may also benefit from pelvic exercises, since they strengthen and retrain the nerves and muscles of the pelvic floor that control the bladder.   \n  \nThe American Urogynecologic Society recommends 4 to 8 sets of 10 Kegel\nsqueezes spread throughout the day.  \n  \n\u201cThe key is to do these correctly and to continue the exercises. Studies show\nthat 60 percent of women do not do their Kegel exercises correctly. Women who\nvisit a pelvic floor physical therapist to learn correct technique do much\nbetter,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says. Ask your doctor to refer you to someone with the\nright expertise.\n\n  * **Hormone therapy** \u2013 For women entering menopause, vaginal estrogen treatments applied locally with an applicator through a vaginal pill or cream can relieve symptoms of urge urinary incontinence.\n  * **Healthy living** \u2013 Some lifestyle changes can also help your bladder and bowel to work more effectively. First, eat a fiber-rich diet to prevent constipation, which can weaken and stretch pelvic floor muscles, nerves and tissues. Keep weight in check through exercise and a healthy diet, since extra weight increases both risk and severity of incontinence. And don\u2019t smoke, since smoking \u2013 and especially related coughing \u2013 adds to your risk.\n\nYou can also avoid caffeine and reduce liquid intake strategically to reduce\nthe episodes of urgency.\n\n## Getting the Right Diagnosis\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing urinary incontinence, don\u2019t hesitate to visit your\ndoctor and explain your symptoms. Many types of doctors can diagnose urinary\nincontinence, including a primary care physician, OB/GYN or urologist.\nUrogynecologists have special training and expertise in women\u2019s incontinence\nissues.\n\nYour doctor will take a detailed medical history and conduct a physical exam.\nThis includes a detailed pelvic exam to assess the organs and muscles. Your\ndoctor will also look for signs of underlying medical conditions that may be\ncausing incontinence and perform any necessary diagnostic tests. You may be\nasked to keep a bladder diary to keep track of when you urinate and when you\nexperience leakage. After the doctor has examined all the data, he or she will\nmake a diagnosis and discuss potential treatments.\n\n## Choosing the Best Treatment\n\nTreatment options have expanded rapidly over the last few years, making\nsolutions much more feasible for women of all ages. These include:\n\n**For both stress and urge incontinence:**\n\n  * **Physical therapy** \u2013 Considered an effective and non-invasive treatment, physical therapy that includes techniques such as pelvic floor muscle exercise (Kegels), bladder retraining and biofeedback can reduce or eliminate both stress and urge urinary incontinence in most women. You\u2019ll want to find a physical therapist specially trained in the area of incontinence; ask your doctor for a referral. The physical therapist will create a treatment plan designed to meet your needs.\n\n**For urge incontinence:**\n\n  * **Medications** \u2013 A number of drugs have proven successful in addressing urge incontinence by blocking signals that cause the bladder to contract too frequently or by helping the bladder to relax. Unfortunately, most of these have side effects including drowsiness, constipation and dry eyes. \u201cWe now have a newer medication, called Myrbetriq\u00ae or Mirabegron, that has fewer side effects. But it\u2019s not covered by all insurances,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says. Talk to your doctor to determine which drug will work for you.\n  * **Botox** \u2013 The same medication long used by plastic surgeons can be used to treat urge incontinence. In a 10-minute procedure, a specially-trained doctor will inject Botox into the back wall of the bladder. The Botox relaxes the bladder and decreases sensitivity to nerve fibers, which helps the bladder to contract more normally.  Dr. Krishnan says a small percentage of patients have difficulty emptying their bladder for a short time after surgery, but this resolves on its own. \u201cMost patients do really well,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you do have to return to your doctor every three to six months to repeat the procedure.\u201d\n  * **Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation** \u2013 Similar to acupuncture, this therapy for urge incontinence uses a small, needle electrode inserted near the ankle to send impulses to the nerves of the pelvis that control bladder function. \u201cThis therapy has been shown to be equal to medication in treating urge incontinence without the side effects,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says. \u201cBut it does involve a time commitment: 12 weeks of therapy each week for 30 minutes, and then once a month to maintain results. The good news is, Medicare does cover it and many urology and urogynecology departments now offer it.\u201d\n  * **Sacral neuromodulation** \u2013 This therapy involves implanting a system that sends electrical pulses directly to the third sacral nerve root to help improve bladder control in people with urge incontinence. If you and your doctor agree to this approach, the doctor will first test the effectiveness by implanting through the back a lead, which is attached to an external monitor. You can determine after seven to 10 days whether the therapy works, after which a long-term device will be implanted. \u201cWomen with severe urge incontinence who don\u2019t respond to medicines are good candidates for this treatment. Sacral neuromodulation also has the advantage of addressing fecal incontinence, which is a problem for about a third of women who have urinary urge incontinence,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says.\n\n**For stress urinary incontinence:**\n\n  * **Vaginal devices** \u2013 Some devices, inserted vaginally, can help improve stress urinary incontinence without the risks of surgery. A pessary is a silicone ring inserted into the vagina by your doctor, similar to a vaginal contraceptive diaphragm. The pessary helps support the urethra to prevent leakage. It can remain in place long-term but needs monitoring by the doctor to avoid problems with vaginal abrasions.  \n  \nAnother device, called Impressa\u00ae, can be inserted by a woman like a tampon to\nlift and give support to the urethra. It can reduce or prevent urine leaks for\nup to eight hours.\n\n  * **Urethral bulking** \u2013 This procedure for stress incontinence involves an injection of material around the urethra to help thicken its walls. It can be done in the doctor\u2019s office or an ambulatory surgery center using local anesthesia. The procedure may need to be repeated every two to three years as the body absorbs the material. \u201cOnly 40 percent of women are dry after this procedure, but 70 to 80 percent are improved,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good option for women who can\u2019t undergo a more invasive surgery. I think my oldest patient was 95 years old.\u201d\n  * **Surgery** \u2013 Thanks to improved methods and higher success rates, surgical intervention is now a viable option for stress urinary incontinence. The most popular surgical method, called the mid-urethral synthetic sling, involves using a thin strip of surgical mesh to lift and support the urethra, preventing the leakage of urine. This surgery can be performed in less than an hour through a small incision in the vaginal area, rather than the abdomen. This helps reduce pain and recovery time. \u201cEighty to eighty-five percent of women are still dry 10 years after this procedure,\u201d Dr. Krishnan says.\n\nAlthough most women choose to try less invasive methods first, Dr. Krishnan\nsays the advance of less invasive surgical approaches means even older women\nwith stress incontinence  or those who have had prior surgeries may want to\ngive surgery another look.\n\nFor all women, dealing with urinary incontinence no longer need be a\nhumiliating or hopeless endeavor.
