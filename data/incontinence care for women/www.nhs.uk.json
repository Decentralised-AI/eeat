It's a common\nproblem thought to affect millions of people.**\n\nThere are several types of urinary incontinence, including:\n\n  * stress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure; for example, when you cough or laugh\n  * urge (urgency) incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pee, or soon afterwards\n  * overflow incontinence (chronic urinary retention) \u2013 when you're unable to fully empty your bladder, which causes frequent leaking\n  * total incontinence \u2013 when your bladder cannot store any urine at all, which causes you to pass urine constantly or have frequent leaking\n\nIt's also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary\nincontinence.\n\nFind out more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence.\n\n## When to seek medical advice\n\nSee a GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is\na common problem and you should not feel embarrassed talking to them about\nyour symptoms.\n\nThis can also be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage\nthe problem.\n\nUrinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with a GP,\nwho will ask about your symptoms and may do a pelvic or rectal examination,\ndepending on whether you have a vagina or a penis.\n\nThe GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you\ndrink and how often you have to urinate.\n\nYou may also be referred to a specialist for more tests.\n\nFind out about diagnosing urinary incontinence.\n\n## Causes of urinary incontinence\n\nStress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening of or damage to the\nmuscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the\nurethral sphincter.\n\nUrge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor\nmuscles, which control the bladder.\n\nOverflow incontinence is often caused by an obstruction or blockage in your\nbladder, which prevents it from emptying fully.\n\nTotal incontinence may be caused by a problem with the bladder from birth, a\nspinal injury, or a small, tunnel like hole that can form between the bladder\nand a nearby area (fistula).\n\nCertain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence, including:\n\n  * pregnancy and vaginal birth\n  * obesity\n  * a family history of incontinence\n  * increasing age \u2013 although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing\n\nFind out more about the causes of urinary incontinence.\n\n## Treating urinary incontinence\n\n### Non-surgical treatments\n\nInitially, a GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve\nyour symptoms.\n\nThese may include:\n\n  * lifestyle changes such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol\n  * pelvic floor exercises, where you strengthen your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them\n  * bladder training, where you learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine\n\nYou may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent\npads and handheld urinals.\n\nMedicine may be recommended if you're still unable to manage your symptoms.\n\nFind out more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence.\n\n### Surgical treatments\n\nSurgery may also be considered. The procedures that are suitable for you will\ndepend on the type of incontinence you have.\n\nSurgical treatment for stress incontinence, such as a sling procedure, is used\nto reduce pressure on the bladder or strengthen the muscles that control\nurination.\n\nSurgery to treat urge incontinence includes enlarging the bladder or\nimplanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor\nmuscles.\n\nFind out more about surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence.\n\n## Preventing urinary incontinence\n\nIt's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some\nsteps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it happening.\n\nThese include:\n\n  * maintaining a healthy weight\n  * changing your drinking habits, including cutting down on alcohol\n  * doing pelvic floor muscle exercises\n\n### Healthy weight\n\nBeing obese can increase your risk of urinary incontinence. You may be able to\nlower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and\nhealthy eating.\n\nUse the healthy weight calculator to see if you are a healthy weight for your\nheight.\n\nGet more information and advice about managing your weight.\n\n### Drinking habits\n\nDepending on your particular bladder problem, a GP can advise you about the\namount of fluids you should drink.\n\nIf you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing\ncaffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to\nproduce more urine and irritate your bladder.\n\nThe recommended weekly limit for alcohol consumption is 14 units.\n\nA unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager or a single\nmeasure (25ml) of spirits.\n\nFind out more about alcohol units.\n\nIf you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking\nless in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink\nenough fluids during the day.\n\n### Pelvic floor exercises\n\nBeing pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow\nof urine from your bladder. If you're pregnant, strengthening your pelvic\nfloor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence.\n\nFind out more about pelvic floor muscle exercises during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone may benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles with pelvic\nfloor exercises.\n\nFind out more about pelvic floor exercises.\n\nInformation:\n\n### Social care and support guide\n\nIf you:\n\n  * need help with day to day living because of illness or disability\n  * care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled (including family members)\n\nOur guide to social care and support explains your options and where you can\nget support.\n\nPage last reviewed: 15 June 2023  \nNext review due: 15 June 2026\n\n  * Next : Symptoms\n\n## Support links\n\n  * Home\n  * Health A to Z\n  * Live Well\n  * Mental health\n  * Care and support\n  * Pregnancy\n  * NHS services\n  * Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\n  * NHS App\n  * Find my NHS number\n  * View your GP health record\n  * About the NHS\n  * Healthcare abroad\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Other NHS websites\n  * Profile editor login\n\n  * About us\n  * Accessibility statement\n  * Our policies\n  * Cookies\n\n\u00a9 Crown copyright\n\n",
