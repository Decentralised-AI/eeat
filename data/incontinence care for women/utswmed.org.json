Our teams use the\nmost advanced evaluation and treatment methods to provide compassionate care\nto relieve symptoms and treat underlying conditions.\n\n## Research-Backed Care for Female Urinary Incontinence\n\nUrinary incontinence, also known as involuntary urination or leaky bladder, is\na lack of bladder control resulting in the unexpected leakage of urine. It\noccurs more often in women than in men, with potential factors such as\npregnancy, childbirth, and menopause playing a role.\n\nWhile urinary incontinence might not be considered a disease, it can be\nassociated with other conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or\nstroke. Incontinence can greatly affect quality of life and often goes\nuntreated for years.\n\nAt UT Southwestern, our physicians offer the most effective and advanced\ntherapies to treat women with all types of urinary incontinence. Our\nphysicians were the first in North Texas to offer botulinum toxin (Botox\u00ae)\ninjections for neurogenic bladder dysfunction. In addition, our physicians\noffer unique treatments such as neuromodulation for patients who have not had\nsuccess with other therapies.\n\n## Types of Urinary Incontinence  \n\nThere are different types of urinary incontinence, each with different\nsymptoms. The five main types are:\n\n  *  **Stress incontinence** : Urine leakage occurs when efforts such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising put pressure on the bladder.\n  *  **Urge incontinence** : Often associated with overactive bladder, this type involves a sudden, intense need to urinate, and urine leaks before the person can get to a toilet.\n  *  **Overflow incontinence** : When the bladder does not completely empty during urination, it can become too full, leading to frequent urine leakage.\n  *  **Functional incontinence** : Problems such as a physical disability, mental impairment, or other barrier can prevent a person from reaching the toilet in time.\n  *  **Mixed incontinence** : People can have more than one type of urinary incontinence, called mixed.\n\n## Causes of Urinary Incontinence  \n\nSometimes, the causes of incontinence are unknown. Some known causes include:\n\n  * Blockage in the urinary tract, such as bladder stones\n  * Certain foods or drinks that act as diuretics, increasing urine production, such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, or citrus fruits\n  * Certain occupations, such as those that involve heavy lifting or exertion\n  * Dementia or other mental health issues that make it difficult to notice the urge to urinate\n  * Diuretic medications such as heart or blood pressure medications, muscle relaxants, or certain sedatives\n  * Diabetes\n  * Injuries to the urinary tract or to the nerves or muscles that control its organs\n  * Neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, or Parkinson\u2019s disease\n  * Pelvic organ prolapse\n  * Pressure on the bladder due to obesity or pregnancy\n  * Side effects of treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy\n  * Urinary tract infection\n  * Weakened pelvic floor muscle\n\n## How Patients Can Help Themselves\n\nIt\u2019s possible to improve urinary incontinence through behavioral techniques,\nlifestyle changes, and certain exercises, including:\n\n  *  **Bladder training** : When the urge to urinate arises, delay a trip to the bathroom by 10 minutes. Over time, increase the duration so that a bathroom visit is made only once every 2.5 to 3.5 hours.\n  * **Timed voiding:**  Schedule a trip to the bathroom every two to four hours rather than waiting for the urge to urinate.\n  * **Double voiding:** After urinating, wait a few minutes and try again. This can help the bladder empty more effectively.\n  * **Pelvic floor therapy/muscle training:** Kegel **** exercises can help strengthen **** the muscles that stop the flow of urine. Tighten (contract) those muscles for three seconds, then relax them for three seconds. Work toward doing at least three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions per day.\n  * **Quitting smoking** **:** A chronic cough can put pressure on the pelvic muscles. **** Smoking has also been shown to significantly contribute to the risk of stress incontinence and urinary urgency in women.\n  * **Weight loss**: Extra weight can contribute to urinary incontinence by putting pressure on the bladder or the tube that allows urine to pass out of the body (urethra).\n  * **Dietary changes** : Avoid caffeine, which irritates the bladder, and alcohol, which causes frequent urination. Cut back on spicy and acidic foods, which can also make incontinence symptoms worse.\n  *  **Smart lifting** : Whenever possible, avoid lifting heavy objects. When it\u2019s necessary to lift a heavy object, engage the pelvic floor muscles before and during the lift.\n\n## Treatment for Urinary Incontinence\n\nOur specialists design treatment plans that are customized to each patient\u2019s\nindividual needs.\n\n### Stress incontinence\n\nWe typically begin treatment for stress incontinence with conservative methods\nsuch as behavioral techniques, lifestyle changes, and pelvic floor exercises.\n\nOther nonsurgical treatment methods for female stress incontinence include:\n\n  * **Vaginal pessary:** Small plastic device that patients can insert into the vagina to support pelvic organs and improve bladder control ****\n  * **Over-the-counter vaginal devices** (such as Impressa) designed to gently support the urethra might help with mild forms of stress incontinence\n\nIf surgery is needed, our skilled specialists offer procedures such as:\n\n  *  **Injectable bulking agents:** Bulking agent injected into tissues around the upper part of the urethra to **** improve the closing ability of the sphincter\n  *  **Retropubic colposuspension** : Surgery performed either laparoscopically or by abdominal incision that closes the urethra and bladder neck \n  * **Sling surgery** : Use of tissue from elsewhere in the body or synthetic material to create a support that helps keep the bladder neck closed\n  *  **Artificial sphincter:** In rare cases, and more commonly in men, an inflatable cuff can be placed around the bladder neck (where the bladder meets the urethra); the cuff is controlled by a pump located in the labia (women) or scrotum (men)\n\n### Urge incontinence\n\nSimilar to that of stress incontinence, treatment for urge incontinence often\nstarts with behavioral techniques, lifestyle changes, and pelvic floor\nexercises.\n\nOur specialists might also prescribe medication and other nonsurgical\ntherapies to improve bladder function. These include:\n\n  * Medications to allow the bladder to hold more urine\n  * Botox\u00ae injections into the bladder to relax muscles\n  * Sacral neuromodulation: Placement of an implantable lead in the sacrum, which allows the bladder to accommodate urine and improve urinary urgency and urge incontinence\n  * Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation: 12 weekly treatments (followed by a maintenance program) using an acupuncture needle to gently stimulate the tibial nerve in the ankle to improve urinary urgency\n\nIf surgery is needed, our skilled specialists offer procedures such as\n**augmentation cystoplasty** , which is a surgery to make the bladder larger.\n\n## Clinical Trials\n\nUT Southwestern\u2019s clinical trials program gives patients access to treatments\nthat are often unavailable at other health care facilities. Depending on the\nspecific condition and the type of incontinence, UT Southwestern can offer\npatients promising therapies years before they are offered to the public. A\nvariety of clinical trials using new devices and ground-breaking agents to\ntreat stress and urge incontinence are currently available at UT Southwestern.  \n\n## Related Conditions and Treatments\n\n  * Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery\n  * Pelvic Rehabilitation\n  * Urology\n\nFind a Clinical Trial\n\nSearch for opportunities to participate in a kidney or urinary system research\nstudy.\n\nStudyFinder\n\nAward-Winning Care\n\nWe\u2019re one of the world\u2019s top academic medical centers, with a unique legacy of\ninnovation in patient care and scientific discovery.  \n\nWhy UT Southwestern\n\nMyChart\n\nOur secure online portal for patients makes it easy to communicate with your\ndoctor, access test results, and more.\n\nLog In\n\n##  MedBlog\n\nWomen's Health; Your Pregnancy Matters\n\n###  Tips to prevent involuntary urine leakage (incontinence) during and after\npregnancy\n\n  * Marlene Corton, M.D.\n\nMay 19, 2020\n\nWomen's Health\n\n###  What Women (and Their Doctors) Don't Talk About\n\n  * David Rahn, M.D.\n\nNovember 9, 2018\n\nMore Articles\n\nResults: **5 Locations**\n\n##  Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery Clinic\n\nat Outpatient Building 1801 Inwood Road, 6th Floor, Suite 210  \nDallas, Texas 75390  214-645-3848 Directions  to Female Pelvic Medicine and\nReconstructive Surgery Clinic  Parking Info  for Female Pelvic Medicine and\nReconstructive Surgery Clinic\n\n##  Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nat UT Southwestern Frisco 12500 Dallas Parkway, 1st Floor  \nFrisco, Texas 75033  469-604-9000 Directions  to Physical Medicine and\nRehabilitation  Parking Info  for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\n##  UT Southwestern Medical Group at Lewisville - Urology\n\n541 West Main Street, Suite 150  \nLewisville, Texas 75057  972-420-8500 Directions  to UT Southwestern Medical\nGroup at Lewisville - Urology\n\n##  Urology\n\nat UT Southwestern Medical Center at Richardson/Plano 3030 Waterview Parkway,\n1st Floor  \nRichardson, Texas 75080  972-669-7007 Directions  to Urology\n\n##  Urology Clinic\n\nat West Campus Building 3 2001 Inwood Road, 4th Floor  \nDallas, Texas 75390  214-645-8765 Directions  to Urology Clinic  Parking Info\nfor Urology Clinic\n\nAppointment New Patient Appointment  or 214-645-8300 or 817-882-2400\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share via Facebook facebook\n  * Share via Twitter twitter\n  * Share via LinkedIn linkedin\n  * Share via Email email\n  * Print this page print\n\nThe future of medicine, today.\n\n  * Getting Care \n    * Find a Doctor\n    * Conditions & Treatments\n    * Locations\n    * Clinical Trials\n    * Physician Referrals\n    * Contact Us\n\n  * Institution \n    * Why UT Southwestern\n    * Make a Gift\n    * Careers\n    * Texas Links\n    * Site Policies\n    * Non-Discrimination Policy\n    * Price Transparency\n\n#####  Main Location\n\n5323 Harry Hines Blvd.  \nDallas, TX 75390\n\n#####  General Inquiries\n\n214-648-3111\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n\n\u00a9 2024 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center\n\nMember of Southwestern Health Resources\n\n",
