And by the time a woman has made an appointment to talk\nabout what she\u2019s dealing with, she has had enough.\n\nIncontinence can be embarrassing, super annoying, and costly. But you don\u2019t\nhave to suffer in silence \u2013 there are many treatment options available.\n\n## When you should see a health care professional\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to wear a pad to soak up urine every day. Also ask yourself\nthese questions:\n\n  * Is the urge to urinate interfering with your work because of leaking or frequent bathroom breaks?\n\n  * Do you map out where bathrooms are when you run errands?\n\n  * Is incontinence interfering with your sex life or intimacy with your partner?\n\nThese are all signs of a problem, and that it may be time for you to talk with\na gynecologist.\n\n## Identifying the problem\n\nWhen I first meet with a patient, we determine what kind of incontinence she\nhas. The two most common types are stress incontinence and urgency\nincontinence.\n\nStress incontinence is triggered by a cough, sneeze, or physical exercise, and\nthe result is leaking urine. Urgency incontinence is leaking after a sudden,\nstrong urge to urinate that you cannot stop. If the patient has a combination\nof the two, we first target the one that\u2019s bothering her the most.\n\n## Treatments for stress incontinence\n\nStress incontinence occurs when weakened pelvic floor muscles can\u2019t hold up to\nthe pressure on the bladder and urethra. These muscles may have weakened due\nto age, vaginal birth, or obesity.\n\nIf the issue may be related to weight, we\u2019ll talk about weight loss. As little\nas an 8 percent weight loss can decrease incontinence by half. I also\nrecommend that patients work with a physical therapist who specializes in\npelvic floor exercises. These exercises strengthen the muscles that control\nurination.\n\nAnother option is a pessary, which is a device that supports the walls of your\nvagina and lifts the bladder and urethra. It\u2019s a non-surgical fix. If we\u2019re\nstill not finding relief after trying a pessary, the surgical option is a\nurethral sling, which is a type of mesh that\u2019s placed under the urethra.\n\nWhen you cough, for example, and the urethra moves, the mesh provides extra\nsupport for the muscles that aren\u2019t doing their job.\n\n## Treatments for urgency incontinence\n\nUrgency incontinence is when you get the urge to go, and if you don\u2019t make it\nto a bathroom, your bladder will empty. It can have serious effects on your\nlife and your work.\n\nExperts don\u2019t know what causes urgency incontinence, but there are different\nways to approach it. First we start with behavioral changes, which vary based\non your situation. Steps could include:\n\n  * Weight loss \u2013 again, losing even a small amount of weight can help.\n\n  * Avoiding excess fluids. If you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, we talk about limiting fluids before bedtime so sleep is less interrupted.\n\n  * \u201cTime voiding,\u201d which is retraining the bladder. If the patient is in the bathroom every hour, we\u2019ll slowly lengthen that interval so they\u2019re in the bathroom less often.\n\n  * Pelvic floor exercises, with help from a physical therapist.\n\n  * Changing your diet. I review a list of bladder irritants: coffee, chocolate, alcohol, spicy foods, and other things. We have patients skip those foods and drinks for a week or two and see what their urgency or frequency is like.\n\nIf behavioral changes don\u2019t help, there are other options to explore. We can\ntry certain medications that relax your bladder muscles and prevent leakage.\nBotox, injected into the muscles of the bladder, can help some patients\ntemporarily. And there are several medications we can try, including\nanticholinergics, which block the impulse to urinate. This can help you get\nmore sleep at night.\n\nWe also can talk about two different procedures that might help. In one\ntechnique, a thin wire is placed under the skin of the lower back. In the\nother treatment, a thin needle is inserted near a nerve in the ankle. Mild\nelectrical signals are sent through the wire or needle to the nerves that\naffect your bladder. This nerve stimulation may help improve bladder control.\n\n## In this together\n\nMy patients and I talk about all of these solutions together and see what\nhelps.\n\nJust remember: It\u2019s OK to talk about these issues. There are a lot of women\ngoing through this \u2013 and a lot of gynecologists who can help.
