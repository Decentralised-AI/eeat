This type of pelvic floor\ndisorder is very common and affects many women of all ages. Unfortunately,\nmany women are embarrassed and do not discuss their symptoms, even with their\ndoctors. Up to one in three women suffer from urinary incontinence. Some women\ndevelop urinary incontinence after childbirth, while others may develop it\nlater in life. The symptoms associated with urinary incontinence can vary in\nseverity. Lifestyle changes or medical treatment can help treat urinary\nincontinence in many women, but when those treatment options do not adequately\ncontrol a woman\u2019s symptoms, there are a variety of procedural and minimally\ninvasive surgical options which are very effective at eliminating symptoms.\n\n## Types of urinary incontinence\n\n  * **Stress urinary incontinence:**  The most common type of incontinence, stress urinary incontinence is urine leakage during exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting heavy objects. Stress urinary incontinence can also occur when other body movements put pressure on the bladder. This type of incontinence occurs when the muscle that acts to keep the urethra closed during times of increased abdominal pressure does not function well anymore and allows urine to leak during those instances.\n  * **Urgency urinary incontinence (overactive bladder):** This refers to urine leakage associated with an urgency to urinate. This type of urinary incontinence occurs when the bladder contracts without warning causing urinary leakage. \n  * **Mixed incontinence:** This type of incontinence implies that a patient\u2019s symptoms of urinary leakage are due to a combination of stress and urgency urinary incontinence types.\n  * **Functional incontinence:** This is urine leakage that occurs when a patient cannot reach a restroom in time because of physical conditions that limit their mobility such as arthritis.\n  * **Overflow incontinence:** This is urine leakage that occurs when the quantity of urine produced exceeds that bladder\u2019s capacity to hold it.\n\nNorthwestern Medicine urogynecologists offer comprehensive evaluations and\ntreatment options for women with urinary incontinence, and they offer both\nconservative and surgical options.
