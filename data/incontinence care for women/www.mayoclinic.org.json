That information\nwill guide treatment decisions.\n\nYour doctor is likely to start with a thorough history and physical exam. You\nmay then be asked to do a simple maneuver that can demonstrate incontinence,\nsuch as coughing.\n\nAfter that, your doctor will likely recommend:\n\n  * **Urinalysis.** A sample of your urine is checked for signs of infection, traces of blood or other abnormalities.\n  * **Bladder diary.** For several days you record how much you drink, when you urinate, the amount of urine you produce, whether you had an urge to urinate and the number of incontinence episodes.\n  * **Postvoid residual measurement.** You're asked to urinate (void) into a container that measures urine output. Then your doctor checks the amount of leftover urine in your bladder using a catheter or ultrasound test. A large amount of leftover urine in your bladder may mean that you have an obstruction in your urinary tract or a problem with your bladder nerves or muscles.\n\nIf further information is needed, your doctor may recommend more-involved\ntests, such as urodynamic testing and pelvic ultrasound. These tests are\nusually done if you're considering surgery.\n\n### Care at Mayo Clinic\n\nOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your urinary\nincontinence-related health concerns Start Here\n\n### More Information\n\n  * Urinary incontinence care at Mayo Clinic\n  * Cystoscopy\n  * Ultrasound\n  * Urinalysis\n\nShow more related information\n\n## Treatment\n\nTreatment for urinary incontinence depends on the type of incontinence, its\nseverity and the underlying cause. A combination of treatments may be needed.\nIf an underlying condition is causing your symptoms, your doctor will first\ntreat that condition.\n\nYour doctor may recommend less invasive treatments to start with and move on\nto other options if these techniques fail to help you.\n\n### Behavioral techniques\n\nYour doctor may recommend:\n\n  * **Bladder training,** to delay urination after you get the urge to go. You may start by trying to hold off for 10 minutes every time you feel an urge to urinate. The goal is to lengthen the time between trips to the toilet until you're urinating only every 2.5 to 3.5 hours.\n  * **Double voiding,** to help you learn to empty your bladder more completely to avoid overflow incontinence. Double voiding means urinating, then waiting a few minutes and trying again.\n  * **Scheduled toilet trips,** to urinate every two to four hours rather than waiting for the need to go.\n  * **Fluid and diet management,** to regain control of your bladder. You may need to cut back on or avoid alcohol, caffeine or acidic foods. Reducing liquid consumption, losing weight or increasing physical activity also can ease the problem.\n\n### Pelvic floor muscle exercises\n\nFemale pelvic floor muscles Enlarge image\n\nClose\n\n### Female pelvic floor muscles\n\n### Female pelvic floor muscles\n\nThe female pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, including the\nuterus, bladder and rectum. Kegel exercises can help strengthen these muscles.\n\nMale pelvic floor muscles Enlarge image\n\nClose\n\n### Male pelvic floor muscles\n\n### Male pelvic floor muscles\n\nThe male pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and bowel and affect sexual\nfunction. Kegel exercises can help strengthen these muscles.\n\nYour doctor may recommend that you do these exercises frequently to strengthen\nthe muscles that help control urination. Also known as Kegel exercises, these\ntechniques are especially effective for stress incontinence but may also help\nurge incontinence.\n\nTo do pelvic floor muscle exercises, imagine that you're trying to stop your\nurine flow. Then:\n\n  * Tighten (contract) the muscles you would use to stop urinating and hold for five seconds, and then relax for five seconds. (If this is too difficult, start by holding for two seconds and relaxing for three seconds.)\n  * Work up to holding the contractions for 10 seconds at a time.\n  * Aim for at least three sets of 10 repetitions each day.\n\nTo help you identify and contract the right muscles, your doctor may suggest\nthat you work with a pelvic floor physical therapist or try biofeedback\ntechniques.\n\n### Medications\n\nMedications commonly used to treat incontinence include:\n\n  * **Anticholinergics.** These medications can calm an overactive bladder and may be helpful for urge incontinence. Examples include oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), tolterodine (Detrol), darifenacin (Enablex), fesoterodine (Toviaz), solifenacin (Vesicare) and trospium chloride.\n  * **Mirabegron (Myrbetriq).** Used to treat urge incontinence, this medication relaxes the bladder muscle and can increase the amount of urine your bladder can hold. It may also increase the amount you are able to urinate at one time, helping to empty your bladder more completely.\n  * **Alpha blockers.** In men who have urge incontinence or overflow incontinence, these medications relax bladder neck muscles and muscle fibers in the prostate and make it easier to empty the bladder. Examples include tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), silodosin (Rapaflo), and doxazosin (Cardura).\n  * **Topical estrogen.** Applying low-dose, topical estrogen in the form of a vaginal cream, ring or patch may help tone and rejuvenate tissues in the urethra and vaginal areas.\n\n### Electrical stimulation\n\nElectrodes are temporarily inserted into your rectum or vagina to stimulate\nand strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Gentle electrical stimulation can be\neffective for stress incontinence and urge incontinence, but you may need\nmultiple treatments over several months.\n\n### Medical devices\n\nTypes of pessaries Enlarge image\n\nClose\n\n### Types of pessaries\n\n### Types of pessaries\n\nPessaries come in many shapes and sizes. The device fits into the vagina and\nprovides support to vaginal tissues displaced by pelvic organ prolapse. A\nhealth care provider can fit a pessary and help provide information about\nwhich type would work best.\n\nDevices designed to treat women with incontinence include:\n\n  * **Urethral insert,** a small, tampon-like disposable device inserted into the urethra before a specific activity, such as tennis, that can trigger incontinence. The insert acts as a plug to prevent leakage and is removed before urination.\n  * **Pessary,** a flexible silicone ring that you insert into your vagina and wear all day. The device is also used in women with vaginal prolapse. The pessary helps support the urethra, to prevent urine leakage.\n\n### Interventional therapies\n\nSacral nerve stimulation device Enlarge image\n\nClose\n\n### Sacral nerve stimulation device\n\n### Sacral nerve stimulation device\n\nDuring sacral nerve stimulation, a surgically implanted device delivers\nelectrical impulses to the nerves that regulate bladder activity. These are\ncalled the sacral nerves. The unit is placed under the skin in the lower back,\nabout where the back pocket is on a pair of pants. In this image, the device\nis shown out of place to allow a better view of the unit.\n\nInterventional therapies that may help with incontinence include:\n\n  * **Bulking material injections.** A synthetic material is injected into tissue surrounding the urethra. The bulking material helps keep the urethra closed and reduce urine leakage. This procedure is for the treatment of stress incontinence and is generally less effective than more-invasive treatments such as surgery. It may need to be repeated more than once.\n  * **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox).** Injections of Botox into the bladder muscle may benefit people who have an overactive bladder and urge incontinence. Botox is generally prescribed to people only if other treatments haven't been successful.\n  * **Nerve stimulators.** There are two types of devices that use painless electrical pulses to stimulate the nerves involved in bladder control (sacral nerves). One type is implanted under your skin in your buttock and connected to wires on the lower back. The other type is a removable plug that is inserted into the vagina. Stimulating the sacral nerves can control overactive bladder and urge incontinence if other therapies haven't worked.\n\n### Surgery\n\nBladder neck suspension Enlarge image\n\nClose\n\n### Bladder neck suspension\n\n### Bladder neck suspension\n\nThe Burch procedure, the most common suspension surgery, adds support to the\nbladder neck and urethra, reducing the risk of stress incontinence. In this\nversion of the procedure, surgery involves placing sutures in vaginal tissue\nnear the neck of the bladder \u2014 where the bladder and urethra meet \u2014 and\nattaching them to ligaments near the pubic bone.\n\nIf other treatments aren't working, several surgical procedures can treat the\nproblems that cause urinary incontinence:\n\n  * **Sling procedures.** Synthetic material (mesh) or strips of your body's tissue are used to create a pelvic sling underneath your urethra and the area of thickened muscle where the bladder connects to the urethra (bladder neck). The sling helps keep the urethra closed, especially when you cough or sneeze. This procedure is used to treat stress incontinence.\n  * **Bladder neck suspension.** This procedure is designed to provide support to your urethra and bladder neck \u2014 an area of thickened muscle where the bladder connects to the urethra. It involves an abdominal incision, so it's done during general or spinal anesthesia.\n  * **Prolapse surgery.** In women who have pelvic organ prolapse and mixed incontinence, surgery may include a combination of a sling procedure and prolapse surgery. Repair of pelvic organ prolapse alone does not routinely improve urinary incontinence symptoms.\n  * **Artificial urinary sphincter.** A small, fluid-filled ring is implanted around the bladder neck to keep the urinary sphincter shut until there's a need to urinate. To urinate, you press a valve implanted under your skin that causes the ring to deflate and allows urine from your bladder to flow.\n\n### Absorbent pads and catheters\n\nIf medical treatments can't eliminate your incontinence, you can try products\nthat help ease the discomfort and inconvenience of leaking urine:\n\n  * **Pads and protective garments.** Most products are no more bulky than normal underwear and can be easily worn under everyday clothing. Men who have problems with dribbles of urine can use a drip collector \u2014 a small pocket of absorbent padding that's worn over the penis and held in place by close-fitting underwear.\n  * **Catheter.** If you're incontinent because your bladder doesn't empty properly, your doctor may recommend that you learn to insert a soft tube (catheter) into your urethra several times a day to drain your bladder. You'll be instructed on how to clean these catheters for safe reuse.\n\n### More Information\n\n  * Urinary incontinence care at Mayo Clinic\n  * Bladder control problems: How to seek treatment\n  * Bladder control problems: Medications\n  * Surgery for stress urinary incontinence in women\n\nShow more related information\n\nRequest an appointment\n\n\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

Early studies have shown that acupuncture can provide\nsome benefit. Yoga also may provide some benefit for urinary incontinence, but\nmore study is needed.\n\n## Coping and support\n\nIf you're embarrassed about a bladder control problem, you may try to cope on\nyour own by wearing absorbent pads, carrying extra clothes or even avoiding\ngoing out.\n\nBut effective treatments are available for urinary incontinence. It's\nimportant to ask your doctor about treatment. Once you do, you'll be on your\nway to regaining an active and confident life.\n\n## Preparing for your appointment\n\nIf you have urinary incontinence, you're likely to start by seeing your\nprimary care doctor. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in\nurinary tract disorders (urologist) or a gynecologist with special training in\nfemale bladder problems and urinary function (urogynecologist).\n\n### What you can do\n\nTo get ready for your appointment, it helps to:\n\n  * **Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions,** such as restricting your diet\n  * **Write down your symptoms,** including how often you urinate, nighttime bladder activity and episodes of incontinence\n  * **Make a list of all your medications,** vitamins and supplements, including doses and how often you take the medication\n  * **Write down key medical information,** including other conditions you may have\n  * **Ask a relative or friend to accompany you,** to help you remember what the doctor says\n  * **Take a notebook or electronic device with you,** and use it to note important information during your visit\n  * **Write down questions to ask** your doctor\n\nFor urinary incontinence, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\n  * What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\n  * What kinds of tests do I need? Do these tests require any special preparation?\n  * Is my urinary incontinence temporary?\n  * What treatments are available?\n  * Should I anticipate any side effects of the treatment?\n  * Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing for me?\n  * I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment as they occur to\nyou.\n\n### What to expect from your doctor\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a few questions, such as:\n\n  * When did you first begin experiencing symptoms, and how severe are they?\n  * Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\n  * What, if anything, seems to improve or worsen your symptoms?\n  * How often do you need to urinate?\n  * When do you leak urine?\n  * Do you have trouble emptying your bladder?\n  * Have you noticed blood in your urine?\n  * Do you smoke?\n  * How often do you drink alcohol and caffeinated beverages?\n  * How often do you eat spicy, sugary or acidic foods?\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\nUrinary incontinence care at Mayo Clinic\n\nRequest an appointment\n\nSymptoms & causesDoctors & departments\n\nFeb. 09, 2023\n\nPrint\n\nShow references\n\n  1.
