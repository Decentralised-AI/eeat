It is important to\nunderstand that leakage is not a normal part of aging and that treatments are\navailable to reduce or eliminate the problem. Your health care clinician can\nhelp you with treatment if you are bothered by leaking urine, having to rush\nto the toilet frequently, or getting up from sleeping to go to the toilet.\n\nThis article discusses treatments for the two main types of leakage in women,\nstress incontinence and urgency incontinence. These treatments also apply to\nwomen who have a combination of urgency and stress incontinence, called mixed\nincontinence. Information about the different types of urinary incontinence\nand the causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of urinary incontinence is available\nseparately. (See \"Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the\nBasics)\".)\n\nMore detailed information about urinary incontinence is available by\nsubscription. (See 'Professional level information' below.)\n\nBEFORE STARTING TREATMENT\n\nCertain health conditions can worsen urine leakage. You should talk to your\nhealth care provider about treating these conditions and any medications that\nmight be worsening your urinary leakage.\n\nYour primary care clinician can help you initiate treatment, but you should\nseek treatment from a continence specialist if you experience accidental urine\nleakage that starts suddenly, particularly if it happens along with other\nsymptoms such as bowel incontinence, numbness, or weakness in your legs. Also,\nyou should seek care from a health professional if you have an inability to\nurinate, blood in the urine, multiple infections (three or more in one year),\nfevers, pain, or vaginal prolapse (a bulge) beyond the opening of the vagina.\n\nINITIAL TREATMENTS\n\nThe following treatments may be helpful for women with stress and/or urgency\nincontinence.\n\nLifestyle modification \u2014 Some changes in your lifestyle may help symptoms of\nurinary leakage.\n\n\u25cf **Weight loss** \u2013 If you are overweight or obese, talk to your health care\nprovider about strategies to lose weight. In people who are obese or\noverweight, losing weight often helps to reduce urine leakage in addition to\nimproving other chronic medical conditions that are associated with\nincontinence (eg, diabetes and hypertension).\n\n\u25cf **Fluid management** \u2013 **** If you drink large amounts of fluids, you may\nfind that cutting back on fluids will reduce your leakage. A total of 64\nounces of all liquids (water, juice, milk, etc) per day is sufficient for most\npeople; you may need more fluid when you are active and sweating or if it is\nhot. If you drink too little fluid, your urine may become very concentrated\nand darker than usual; this can irritate your bladder and increase the urgency\nto urinate. One recommendation is to drink small amounts of fluid at regular\nintervals throughout the day (rather than drinking larger amounts all at\nonce).\n\nWe also suggest reducing the amount of alcoholic, caffeinated, and carbonated\nbeverages you drink. This may help decrease urinary urgency and leakage.\n\nIf you get up frequently during the night to urinate, stop drinking fluids\nthree to four hours before you go to bed. You can also wear compression\nstockings during the day to prevent fluid from pooling in your legs during the\nday, which is eliminated at night when you are sleeping. If you have leg\nswelling, you can elevate your legs above the level of your heart before you\ngo to bed.\n\n\u25cf **Avoiding constipation** \u2013 **** Constipation can make urinary leakage\nworse. Increasing the amount of fiber in your diet to 30 grams per day may\nprevent constipation. Treatment of constipation is discussed in a separate\ntopic. (See \"Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n\n\u25cf **Scheduled voiding** \u2013 Emptying your bladder (\"voiding\") at regular\nintervals, rather than waiting until your bladder is very full, can decrease\nepisodes of urgency incontinence and prevent stress leakage during physical\nactivity with a full bladder. Try urinating every three to four hours\nregularly throughout the day.\n\nPelvic muscle exercises \u2014 Pelvic muscle exercises, also known as Kegel\nexercises, strengthen the muscles involved in controlling urine leakage. This\nis explained in a table (table 1). (See \"Patient education: Pelvic floor\nmuscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n\nPracticing these exercises on a regular basis helps to strengthen the muscles\nused to support the urethra and prevent leakage caused by stress incontinence\n(eg, coughing, laughing, sneezing). If you have sudden urges to urinate, you\ncan also perform these exercises to help temporarily control the urge. To do\nthis, you need to stop what you are doing and do three quick pelvic floor\ncontractions until the urgency subsides. Using this \"freeze and squeeze\"\ntechnique can reduce bladder contractions and give you more time to get to the\ntoilet. If you have difficulty doing these exercises there are a lot of\noptions that can help, including mobile apps, vaginal cones, pelvic floor\nexercise devices, and supervised physical therapy. Talk to your health care\nprovider to see what options are available to help you do the exercises\nbetter.\n\nBladder training \u2014 Bladder training can help you learn to go to the bathroom\nless frequently by \"retraining\" your bladder to hold more urine. Bladder\ntraining has two components: going to the bathroom on a schedule while you are\nawake and using strategies to control sudden urges. A table describes a method\nfor bladder training (table 2).\n\n\u25cfYou begin by going to the bathroom at specific intervals during the day,\nstarting with a short time interval between trips to the bathroom.\n\n\u25cfIf you have an urgent need to urinate before it is time to go the bathroom\nagain, try to suppress the urge by standing or sitting still, performing the\npelvic muscle exercise described above (\"freeze and squeeze\"), and thinking of\nthe urge as a wave that is fading away.\n\n\u25cfWhen your urine control improves, increase the time between bathroom trips by\n15 minutes. Your goal is to slowly increase this time up to a more normal\ninterval. It is normal to urinate approximately every three to four hours\nduring the day and for older adults to wake from sleeping to urinate up to\nonce per night.\n\nTopical vaginal estrogen \u2014 Vaginal estrogen may be helpful for women who are\nnear menopause or have gone through menopause and have urinary incontinence\nand vaginal atrophy (dryness). (See \"Patient education: Vaginal dryness\n(Beyond the Basics)\".)\n\nTREATMENTS FOR STRESS INCONTINENCE\n\nIf you continue to have symptoms despite the initial treatments for stress\nurinary incontinence, you can discuss other options with your health care\nprovider.\n\n\u25cf **Supervised pelvic floor physical therapy** \u2013 If you are not performing\nKegel exercises effectively, you may benefit from formal instruction on how to\ndo them. There are nurses and physical therapists specifically trained to\nassist with these exercises for your pelvic floor muscles, like having a\n\"personal trainer.\"\n\n\u25cf **Vaginal pessaries** \u2013 **** A vaginal pessary is a flexible device made of\nsilicone that can be worn in the vagina. A pessary can help to reduce or\neliminate stress incontinence to support the urethra. A pessary is a\nreasonable treatment if you want to delay or avoid surgery. When fit properly,\nyou will not feel any discomfort with the pessary.\n\nThe pessary must be removed and cleaned with soap and water periodically. Many\nwomen can learn to do this on their own and are advised to remove it overnight\nonce every week or two. For those women who cannot remove the device, the\npessary can be monitored, cleaned, and replaced by a health care provider\nevery three to six months. There is a small risk that the pessary can cause\nirritation or an erosion of the skin inside the vagina. If this occurs,\nvaginal estrogen and/or more frequent removal can resolve the problem.\n\nOver-the-counter support devices are also available for stress incontinence\nand may be an option for women who don\u2019t have access to obtain a pessary or\nwant to try something on their own before evaluation and treatment by a health\ncare provider.\n\n\u25cf **Medications** \u2013 In the United States, there are no medications that have\nbeen approved for stress incontinence. Multiple medications have been\nevaluated for stress incontinence, but none are approved by the US Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA). You should talk to your health care provider about\nwhether or not there are any medication options that are appropriate for you.\n\n\u25cf **Urethral bulking injections** \u2013 Urethral bulking injections are outpatient\n(in-office) procedures performed with local anesthesia. After numbing the\nurethra, the clinician injects a filler material in the urethra to increase\nresistance to the urine flow that occurs with activities (ie, stress urinary\nincontinence). No incisions or recovery time is needed; however, urethral\ninjections are less effective compared with traditional surgery for stress\nurinary incontinence.\n\n\u25cf **Surgery for stress urinary incontinence** \u2013 **** Surgery offers the\nhighest cure rate of any treatment for stress urinary incontinence, even in\nolder women. There are several surgical procedures for the treatment of stress\nincontinence. Each procedure has its own risks, benefits, complications, and\nchance of failure. These issues should be discussed in detail with a surgeon\nwho is experienced in performing procedures to treat incontinence.\n\nIn general, surgery for stress urinary incontinence is not recommended until\nyou are finished having children because pregnancy and childbirth can cause\ndamage, potentially allowing leakage to recur.\n\n\u25cf **Laser treatments** \u2013 There is currently not enough evidence to support the\nuse of vaginal laser treatment for stress urinary incontinence; however,\nresearch studies are underway. These treatments are not covered by insurance.\n\nTREATMENTS FOR URGENCY INCONTINENCE AND OVERACTIVE BLADDER\n\nIf you continue to have symptoms despite initial treatments for urgency\nincontinence, you can discuss other options, such as medication and nerve\nstimulation, with your health care provider.\n\nMedications \u2014 In some people, urgency incontinence is more severe and a\nmedicine is needed to get symptoms under control. There are two main classes\nof medications: anticholinergics and beta adrenergics. Examples of\nanticholinergic medications include darifenacin (brand name: Enablex),\nfesoterodine (brand name: Toviaz), oxybutynin (sample brand names: Ditropan,\nOxytrol, Gelnique), solifenacin (brand name: VESIcare), tolterodine (sample\nbrand name: Detrol), and trospium (brand name: Sanctura). There are two beta\nadrenergic medications called mirabegron (brand name: Myrbetriq) and vibegron\n(brand name: Gemtesa).\n\nSome people take medicine temporarily, until symptoms improve, while others\ntake medication indefinitely.\n\n\u25cfThe most common side effects of anticholinergic medications are dry mouth and\nconstipation. Other side effects include blurred vision for near objects, fast\nheart rate, drowsiness, urinary retention, and decreased cognitive function.\nThese medications should not be used in patients with certain heart\narrhythmias, gastric retention, myasthenia gravis (a thyroid disease), or\nnarrow angle-closure glaucoma. The Oxytrol patch is associated with the least\namount of these side effects and is available over the counter without a\nprescription. In the United States, tolterodine is also available without a\nprescription, whereas the other medications require a prescription. New\nevidence has linked long-term exposure of anticholinergics at high doses to\ndementia. Mirabegron works differently than the other medications and does not\ncause dry mouth and constipation side effects but may raise blood pressure, so\nyou should have your blood pressure monitored carefully while taking this\nmedication. Vibegron does not have the same issues with elevating blood\npressure and can be chewed or crushed for people with difficulty swallowing\npills. Some studies show that taking both an anticholinergic and a beta\nadrenergic together may be more effective than taking either one alone.\n\n\u25cfThere are several strategies to prevent and treat dry mouth and constipation.\nThese include sucking on sugar-free candy or chewing gum and using over-the-\ncounter oral lubricants. Constipation can be managed typically with fiber\nsupplementation and dietary options such as prunes and prune juice. It is\nimportant not to drink more water to combat these symptoms, as excessive fluid\nintake can result in more urine leakage.\n\n\u25cfThere is a small risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the\nbladder completely) with these medications, especially in older people. If you\ndevelop difficulty urinating or feel like you are not completely emptying your\nbladder, you should follow up with your provider for evaluation.\n\nOther therapies \u2014 If medications are not enough to improve your symptoms,\nthere are other options for treatment that you can discuss with your health\ncare provider.\n\n\u25cf **Acupuncture** \u2013 Acupuncture might improve stress and/or urgency urinary\nincontinence in some women.\n\n\u25cf **Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation** \u2013 This treatment involves placing\na hair-thin needle (like acupuncture) into a nerve near the ankle. This nerve\nis connected to nerves in the lower back that affect your bladder. The needle\nis connected to a small device that sends electrical pulses to the nerve. The\ntreatment is not painful. This treatment is performed in a health care\nclinician's office once per week for 12 weeks and, if needed, can be continued\nmonthly for maintenance. However, you must not use this treatment (it is\n\"contraindicated\") if you have a cardiac pacemaker or infection or severe\nswelling of your ankles.\n\n\u25cf **Botox** \u2013 **** Botulinum toxin A, also known as Botox, is a toxin produced\nby a bacteria that temporarily paralyzes muscles. Studies have examined using\ninjections of Botox into the bladder as a treatment for urgency incontinence,\nfor people who have not responded to other treatments. Botulinum toxin A is as\neffective as oral medication in decreasing leakage and more effective in\neliminating leakage altogether.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that botulinum toxin A will cause urinary tract\ninfections or prevent the bladder from emptying. If you are unable to empty\nyour bladder, you would need to insert a catheter (a thin tube) into your\nbladder several times per day to empty. However, the side effects are usually\ntemporary (a few weeks). The decrease in leakage with botulinum toxin A\ninjection can last six months or longer and the procedure needs to be repeated\nto not have leakage.\n\n\u25cf **Sacral neuromodulation** \u2013 **** A sacral nerve stimulator (SNS) is a\nsurgically implanted device that treats urinary incontinence. The device is\nplaced under the skin in the upper buttock and is connected by wires to a\nnerve (the sacral nerve) in the lower back. It sends electrical pulses to the\nsacral nerve, which helps people with urgency incontinence, urgency and\nfrequency, or urinary retention who have not improved with other treatments.\nIt is similar to Botox in treating incontinence and can be tested first before\nthe permanent implant is placed. Newer technology allows people with a SNS\ndevice to undergo MRI procedures if needed (in the past, a person with this\ndevice could not get an MRI). There are options of a rechargeable battery that\nis expected to last more than 15 years versus a non-rechargeable battery that\nlasts between 5 and 10 years. The devices range in size from 2.8 x 2.8 cm\n(about 1 inch square) to 4.4 x 5.5 cm (about 2 inches square).\n\nPotential risks of the surgery include pain at the site where the unit is\nimplanted (in the buttocks), movement of the device over time, infection, and\nothers. More detailed information about sacral nerve stimulation is available\nseparately. (See \"Patient education: Treatment of interstitial\ncystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)\", section on 'Electrical\nstimulation for painful bladder'.)\n\nOTHER MEASURES\n\nPads \u2014 While pads are not a recommended treatment for incontinence, they are\nnecessary in some cases. Pads and protective undergarments are available in a\nvariety of sizes and absorbencies, depending upon how much you leak. Pads\ndesigned for menstrual bleeding are usually not typically adequate.\n\nInformation on pad varieties and other urinary incontinence supplies is\navailable from medical supply companies and urinary incontinence advocacy\ngroups (see 'Where to get more information' below). The United States National\nAssociation for Continence has an online tool that can help you to choose a\nprotective garment.\n\nWhatever pad you choose, it is important to keep your skin dry and to control\nurine odor. If your skin is exposed to urine for long periods, it can become\nirritated and can potentially develop skin burns or infection. Use of zinc-\nbased barrier products can help protect the skin (ie, zinc oxide). Protective\nproducts for the bed or other furniture may also be needed.\n\nPads are expensive and are not usually covered by insurance; in the United\nStates, some state Medicaid plans cover the cost of pads for people with very\nlimited incomes. In other countries, pads may be obtained for no or little\ncost through continence advisor nurses.\n\nSuction catheters \u2014 There are commercially available devices that wick\nmoisture from undergarments using an external catheter (flexible tube) and a\nportable suction machine. These can be used at home to help minimize moisture\nand skin damage from wet undergarments or pads.\n\nPortable toilet \u2014 If you have difficulty walking, talk to your health care\nclinician. You may benefit from a portable toilet (ie, commode) that can be\nplaced close to your bed or living area. In addition, move electrical cords,\nloose rugs, or furniture out of hallways and walkways so that you do not trip\nor fall on the way to the bathroom.\n\nWHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION\n\nYour healthcare clinician is the best source of information for questions and\nconcerns related to your medical problem.\n\nThis article will be updated as needed on our web site\n(www.uptodate.com/patients).
