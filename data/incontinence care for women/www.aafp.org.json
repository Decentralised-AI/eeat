A stepped-care approach that advances from\nleast invasive (behavioral modification) to more invasive (surgery)\ninterventions is recommended. Bladder retraining and pelvic floor muscle\nexercises are first-line treatments for persons without cognitive impairment\nwho present with urge incontinence. Neuromodulation devices, such as posterior\ntibial nerve stimulators, are an option for urge incontinence that does not\nrespond to behavioral therapy. Pharmacologic therapy with anticholinergic\nmedications is another option for treating urge incontinence if behavioral\ntherapy is unsuccessful; however, because of adverse effects, these agents are\nnot recommended in older adults. Other medication options for urge\nincontinence include mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA. Sacral nerve\nstimulators, which are surgically implanted, have also been shown to improve\nsymptoms of urge incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle exercises are considered\nfirst-line treatment for stress incontinence. Noninvasive electrical and\nmagnetic stimulation devices are also available. Alternatives for treating\nstress incontinence include vaginal inserts, such as pessaries, and urethral\nplugs. Limited or conflicting evidence exists for the use of medications for\nstress incontinence; no medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration for this condition. Minimally invasive procedures, including\nradiofrequency denaturation of the urethra and injection of periurethral\nbulking agents, can be used if stress incontinence does not respond to less\ninvasive treatments. Surgical interventions, such as sling and urethropexy\nprocedures, should be reserved for stress incontinence that has not responded\nto other treatments.\n\nUrinary incontinence, defined as the involuntary leakage of urine, affects 20\nmillion persons nationwide. 1 Estimations of prevalence range from 3 to 55\npercent, depending on the definition and the population.2 Within nursing\nhomes, 60 to 70 percent of patients experience the disorder.3 These estimates\nare thought to be conservative, because at least one-half of patients do not\nreport incontinence to a physician.4\n\n### SORT: KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE\n\n _zoom_out_map_ Enlarge _print_ Print\n\n_Clinical recommendation_|  _Evidence rating_|  _References_  \n---|---|---  \nConservative therapies (e.g., behavioral therapy and lifestyle modification)\nshould be the first-line treatment for stress and urge urinary incontinence.|\nC| 6, 7, 13  \nPharmacologic interventions (e.g., anticholinergics) should be used as an\nadjunct to behavioral therapies for refractory urge incontinence.| C| 3, 9, 10  \nSurgical therapy should be considered in women with stress incontinence that\nhas not responded to less invasive treatment modalities.| C| 12, 48, 49  \n  \n_A = consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or\nlimited-quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented\nevidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series.

Two other types\nof incontinence, overflow and functional, also occur in women, but they are\nfar less common and are not reviewed here in detail. Overflow incontinence\n(urinary retention) is most often caused by adverse effects of anticholinergic\ndrugs or by impaired detrusor innervation from neurologic disease. If no\nreversible cause is found, treatment usually requires intermittent or\nindwelling catheter drainage of the bladder to avoid hydronephrosis and renal\nimpairment. Functional incontinence is caused by an inability to get to the\ntoilet because of physical limitations or cognitive impairment. Treatment is\naimed at assisting the patient with toileting.\n\n_Table 1._\n\n### Classification of Urinary Incontinence in Women\n\n _zoom_out_map_ Enlarge _print_ Print\n\n_Type_|  _Pathophysiology_|  _Symptoms_|  _Patient profile_  \n---|---|---|---  \n **Most common**  \nUrge|\n\n  * Detrusor overactivity\n\nNeurologic disorders\n\nSpinal cord injury\n\n|\n\n  * Loss of urine accompanied or preceded by strong desire to void; may be accompanied by frequency and nocturia\n\n|\n\n  * Most common in older adults\n\nStrong association with stroke\n\n  \nStress|\n\n  * Increased urethral mobility\n\nIntrinsic sphincter dysfunction\n\n|\n\n  * Loss of urine with physical exertion or increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., sneezing, coughing, laughing)\n\n|\n\n  * Most common in younger women\n\nSecond most common type in older women\n\n  \nMixed|\n\n  * Mixed etiology\n\n|\n\n  * Combination of urge and stress symptoms\n\n|\n\n  * Overall most common type\n\n  \n **Less common**  \nOverflow|\n\n  * Anatomic obstruction\n\nImpaired detrusor contractility from neurologic disorders, including diabetic\nneuropathy\n\n|\n\n  * Dribbling and/or continuous leakage associated with incomplete bladder emptying\n\n|\n\n  * Bladder outlet obstruction is uncommon in women\n\nMore often occurs because of neurologic disorders\n\n  \nFunctional|\n\n  * Cognitive, mobility, or psychological impairment\n\n|\n\n  * Loss of urine associated with inability to toilet because of impaired cognitive, psychological, or physical function\n\n|\n\n  * More often occurs in patients with arthritis, gait disturbance, or dementia\n\n  \n  \n_Information from references6 and 7_.\n\n## General Treatment Considerations\n\nGuidelines for diagnosis and treatment of urinary incontinence were published\nin 2012 by the American Urological Association.8 The usual approach to the\ntreatment of urinary incontinence is a stepped-care plan starting with\nnoninvasive behavioral modifications, followed by devices and pharmacologic\ninterventions, and finally surgery in those whose symptoms do not respond to\ninitial treatment. Treatment options are shown in _Table 2_.3,6,7,9\u201312\nLifestyle changes, including avoiding excessive fluid intake and limiting\ncaffeinated or carbonated beverages, are also reasonable recommendations for\nall types of incontinence.13 When patients have mixed incontinence, treatment\nshould be directed toward the predominant symptom.14\n\n_Table 2._\n\n### Treatment Options for Urinary Incontinence\n\n _zoom_out_map_ Enlarge _print_ Print\n\n_Type_|  _Conservative management_|  _Pharmacologic_|  _Surgical_  \n---|---|---|---  \nUrge|\n\n  * Weight loss\n\nFluid reduction\n\nConstipation management\n\nBladder training\n\nPelvic floor muscle exercises\n\nElectrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve\n\n|\n\n  * Anticholinergic drugs\n\nBeta-adrenergic agonists (mirabegron [Myrbetriq])\n\nOnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)\n\nIntravaginal estrogen*\n\n|\n\n  * Neuromodulation (implanted sacral nerve stimulator)\n\n  \nStress|\n\n  * Weight loss\n\nSmoking cessation\n\nFluid reduction\n\nConstipation management\n\nPelvic floor muscle exercises (alone or with manual or biofeedback)\n\nExtracorporeal magnetic innervation\n\nElectrical stimulation\n\nMechanical devices (e.g., pessary, urethral plugs)\n\n|\n\n  * Alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine)*\n\nDuloxetine (Cymbalta)*\n\n| Sling procedures\n\n  * Suburethral sling with tension-free vaginal tape\n\nPubovaginal sling\n\nMidurethral sling\n\nUrethropexy\n\n  * Needle urethropexy\n\nRetropubic urethropexy or colposuspension (i.e., Burch and Marshal-Marchetti-\nKrantz procedures)\n\nPeriurethral injections of bulking agents  \nMixed|\n\n  * Combination of above treatments with focus on dominant symptoms\n\n|\n\n  * Medication focused on dominant symptoms\n\n|\n\n  * \u2014\n\n  \nOverflow|\n\n  * Relief of obstruction\n\nClean intermittent catheterization\n\nIndwelling urethral catheter\n\n|\n\n  * Alpha-adrenergic antagonists or blockers (e.g., tamsulosin [Flomax])\n\n|\n\n  * Suprapubic catheter\n\n  \n  \nnote: _Treatments are listed in approximate order of priority; clinical\njudgment required_.\n\n*\u2014 _Not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of urinary incontinence_.\n\n _Information from references3, 6, 7, and 9 through 12_.\n\n## Urge Incontinence\n\nUrge incontinence is characterized by an abrupt desire to void accompanied by\nan involuntary leakage of urine. This type of incontinence is common in older\nwomen.9 The broad diagnostic category of overactive bladder encompasses the\nsymptoms of frequency, urgency, and nocturia; if these symptoms occur with\nincontinence, it is considered urge incontinence.6\n\n### BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS\n\nBehavioral strategies are first-line treatment for urge incontinence in\npersons with no cognitive impairment.13,15 Bladder training and pelvic floor\nmuscle strengthening exercises can be used, and both are described in _Table\n3_.13 Bladder training involves teaching the patient to suppress the urge to\nvoid.13 There is mixed evidence demonstrating improved outcomes with this\nstrategy, stemming from studies of variable quality.14\n\n_Table 3._\n\n### Common Behavioral Therapy for Urinary Incontinence\n\n _zoom_out_map_ Enlarge _print_ Print\n\n_Intervention_|  _Description_|  _Indication_|  _Procedure_  \n---|---|---|---  \nBladder training| Retrain pelvic mechanisms and the central nervous system to\ninhibit urge sensation between voids| Urge incontinence in patients without\ncognitive impairment| Instruct the patient as follows:  \nRemain stationary when urgency occurs  \nConcentrate on decreasing the sense of urgency through rapid successive pelvic\nmuscle contractions, mental distraction (e.g., mathematical problem solving),\nand relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing)  \nAfter controlling the sense of urgency, walk slowly to the bathroom and void  \nAfter mastering this, attempt to extend the time that urination can be\npostponed; aim to extend the interval by 30 to 60 minutes  \nContinue this process until voiding occurs every three to four hours without\nincontinence  \nHabit training| Individualized toileting scheduled to preempt involuntary\nvoiding| Urge incontinence in patients with cognitive impairment| Check for\nwetness at intervals to determine when the patient urinates  \nBring the patient to the toilet, or provide commode or bedpan at intervals\nslightly shorter than the patient's normal voiding interval  \nPelvic floor muscle exercises| Muscle contraction and relaxation to reduce\nincontinence by producing urethral closure and decreasing central nervous\nsystem stimulation of detrusor muscle| Urge and/or stress incontinence in\npatients without cognitive impairment| Assist the patient in isolating pelvic\nfloor muscles by instructing her to hold urine during urination and to feel\npelvic muscle floor contraction (while avoiding buttock, abdomen, or thigh\nmuscle contraction)  \nAsk the patient to perform three sets of eight to 10 contractions (held for\nsix to eight seconds) three to four times weekly; extend contraction time to10\nseconds, if possible  \nContinue regimen for at least 15 to 20 weeks  \nPrompted voiding| Reminder to urinate on a regular schedule| Urge incontinence\nin patients with cognitive impairment| Remind the patient to use the toilet at\nregular intervals, ideally timed to the patient's normal voiding intervals  \nScheduled voiding| Voiding on a regular schedule| Urge incontinence in\npatients with cognitive impairment| Bring the patient to the toilet at regular\nintervals (e.g., every two to three hours)  \n  \n_Information from reference13_.\n\nAlthough many physicians think of pelvic floor muscle exercises, commonly\nknown as Kegel exercises, as a treatment for only stress incontinence, they\nare also an effective treatment for urge incontinence. Properly performed\npelvic floor muscle exercises are more effective than medications for reducing\nurge incontinence.16\n\nFor patients who have cognitive impairment and urge incontinence, several\nother behavioral strategies can be used, including habit training, scheduled\nvoiding, and prompted voiding _(Table 3)_.13 Studies indicate that scheduled\nvoiding may be the most effective, with clear short-term benefits.17,18\n\n### DEVICES\n\nSeveral electrical neuromodulation devices are approved by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) for treating urge incontinence refractory to\nbehavioral interventions. Although the precise mode of action is unknown, the\neffects can be explained by modulating reflex pathways. Techniques include the\nuse of removable vaginal or anal stimulators and percutaneous stimulators of\nthe posterior tibial nerve, which shares a common nerve root with the\ninnervation of the bladder.\n\nPosterior tibial nerve stimulators are the most widely used devices. In this\noffice-based procedure, a needle electrode is applied near the medial\nmalleolus, and electrical stimulation is administered in 30-minute sessions.\nPosterior tibial nerve stimulation works at least as well as medication,\nreducing urge incontinence in up to 75 percent of patients.19 A demonstration\nof the technique can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0drKILgxhiM.\n\n### PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY\n\nMedications can be used to treat urge and mixed incontinence if behavioral\ntherapy is unsuccessful. Cure is rarely achieved solely with drug therapy,\nhowever, and in many studies improvement over placebo is modest.6,7\nCombination therapy with medication and behavioral treatments is more\neffective than either modality alone.6,7\n\n_Anticholinergic Drugs_. Anticholinergics are the preferred agents for the\ntreatment of urge incontinence14 _(Table 4_3,9,10,20,21 _)_. They reduce\ndetrusor overactivity by antagonizing M2/M3 muscarinic receptors in the\nbladder.3 M2/M3-selective agents are preferred over nonselective agents, which\nalso bind M1 receptors in the brain and can unmask cognitive dysfunction,\nalthough both selective and nonselective agents may do so.22,23 A trial of\nfour to eight weeks is recommended. Although no one drug is clearly superior,\nlong-acting agents are generally preferred because of greater effectiveness\nand fewer adverse anticholinergic effects.3,24,25 However, anticholinergic\neffects may occur with any of these medications, and patients commonly stop\ntaking them.3,6,24\n\n_Table 4._\n\n### Anticholinergic Drugs for Treatment of Urge Incontinence\n\n _zoom_out_map_ Enlarge _print_ Print\n\n_Drug_|  _Formulations_|  _Unique factors_  \n---|---|---  \n **Nonselective agents**  \nFesoterodine (Toviaz)| Extended release|\n\n  * High drug levels in persons with poor metabolism of cytochrome P450 2D6\n\n  \nOxybutynin (Ditropan)| Extended release|\n\n  * Originally the preferred medication\n\nHighest rate of anticholinergic adverse effects\n\n  \nImmediate release  \nTopical gel  \nTransdermal patch  \nTolterodine (Detrol)| Extended release|\n\n  * Fewer adverse effects than oxybutynin\n\n  \nImmediate release  \nTrospium (Sanctura)| Extended release|\n\n  * Renally cleared\n\n  \nImmediate release  \n **M2/M3-selective agents**  \nDarifenacin (Enablex)| Extended release|\n\n  * Higher selectivity for M3 muscarinic receptors\n\n  \nSolifenacin (Vesicare)| Extended release  \n  \nnote: _Adverse effect profile of these drugs includes tachycardia,\npalpitations, edema, confusion, psychomotor retardation, nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, constipation, urinary retention, blurry vision, and dry\nmouth_.\n\n _Information from references3, 9, 10, 20, and 21_.\n\nBecause of adverse effects, the American Geriatrics Society recommends\navoiding these medications in older adults unless no alternatives are\navailable.26 Furthermore, the anticholinergic action of these medications can\ncounter the procholinergic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat\ndementia. Dementia is a contraindication to the use of anticholinergics, as\nare narrow-angle glaucoma and gastrointestinal obstruction/gastric retention.3\n\n_Beta-Adrenergic Agonists_. Approved by the FDA in 2012, mirabegron\n(Myrbetriq) is from a new class of drugs used to treat urge incontinence.\nMirabegron acts on beta3-adrenergic receptors to relax the detrusor.27 Studies\nhave shown that use of mirabegron results in one to two fewer incontinence\nepisodes per day, similar to sustained-release tolterodine (Detrol).28 Common\nadverse effects are nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and headache.27\nIncreased blood pressure can also occur, and mirabegron should not be used in\npatients with uncontrolled hypertension.27 When used with an anticholinergic,\nthe risk of urinary retention increases.27\n\n_OnabotulinumtoxinA_. Also recently approved by the FDA, injection of\nonabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) into the detrusor muscle can be considered for\ntreating urge incontinence that has not responded to conservative\ntreatments.7,9,25,29 OnabotulinumtoxinA is superior to placebo in reducing\nincontinence as well as in improving quality of life.29 Symptom reduction\nlasts three to six months.9,29 Optimal doses for effectiveness and long-term\nsafety have not yet been determined.14,29\n\n_Estrogen_. Although intravaginal estrogen is sometimes used to treat urge\nincontinence, neither intravaginal nor systemic estrogens are FDA-approved for\nthis. Systemic estrogen has been shown to worsen incontinence.10,30\n\n### SURGERY\n\nUrge incontinence can be treated with surgically implanted devices that\nstimulate the sacral, paraurethral, and pudendal nerves.31 Sacral nerve\nstimulators are most commonly used, and up to two-thirds of patients\nexperience improvement in symptoms, which is notable because these devices are\nused only for symptoms that are refractory to all other treatment.14\nImplantable devices are costly and carry a risk of surgical complications.31\n\n## Stress Incontinence\n\nStress incontinence is characterized by the involuntary loss of urine with\nincreases in intra-abdominal pressure. It is the most common type of\nincontinence in younger women, but also occurs in older women.9 Key risk\nfactors include childbirth, medications that relax the urethral sphincter,\nobesity, lung disease (from chronic cough), and prior pelvic surgeries.9\nNumerous treatments are available, although few studies compare one treatment\nwith another.\n\n### WEIGHT LOSS\n\nWomen who are overweight or obese and who experience stress incontinence\nshould be encouraged to lose weight, which has been shown to reduce the\nfrequency of incontinence symptoms.32\n\n### BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS\n\nPelvic floor muscle exercises are the mainstay of behavioral therapy for\nstress incontinence11,13 _(Table 3_13 _)_. Up to 38 percent of patients with\nstress incontinence alone who follow a pelvic floor muscle exercise regimen\nfor at least three months experience a cure.14,33 Increased effectiveness is\ndemonstrated in women undergoing longer training and in those following\ncomprehensive clinic-based training rather than self-help booklets.34,35\n\nManual feedback (palpating the pelvic muscles during the exercises) and\nbiofeedback (using a vaginal or anal device that provides visual or audio\nfeedback about pelvic muscle contraction) have been used to teach patients the\ncorrect technique.13,36 Weighted intravaginal cones have also been used for\nimproving technique when women have difficulty identifying their pelvic floor\nmuscles. Although these strategies may improve technique and, consequently,\nsymptoms in the short term, there is no evidence that they result in higher\nrates of long-term improvement or cure than the exercises alone.37,38\n\n### ELECTRICAL AND MAGNETIC STIMULATION\n\nElectrical stimulation of the pelvic floor muscles with a vaginal or anal\nelectrode can be used in women who cannot voluntarily contract pelvic floor\nmuscles.13 This can be done at home and typically consists of two 15-minute\nsessions daily for 12 weeks. Medicare has approved its use in patients who\nhave incontinence that does not respond to structured pelvic floor muscle\nexercise programs.\n\nExtracorporeal magnetic innervation involves a series of treatments in which\nthe patient sits, fully clothed, on a chair that generates a low-power\nmagnetic field. Patients typically undergo two or three treatments per week\nfor six to eight weeks. One early study showed this method to be most\neffective for women who have mild stress incontinence (i.e., using three\nsanitary pads per day or fewer).39 A more recent study found it to be more\neffective than sham treatment for women who are unable to generate adequate\npelvic floor muscle contractions.40\n\n### DEVICES\n\nVaginal inserts, including incontinence pessaries and incontinence tampons,\ncan be used for treating stress incontinence in pregnant women, in those who\nare not surgical candidates, and in those whose symptoms have not responded to\nprevious surgeries.41 Vaginal inserts compress the bladder neck and urethra,\nthus decreasing urine loss caused by stress incontinence. Although pessaries\nare not widely used, their associated risks and costs are low, and they\nachieve results quickly. There are few contraindications to pessary use (e.g.,\nactive pelvic infection, severe ulceration, allergy to product materials,\nnoncompliance).41 Incontinence tampons, which also place pressure on the\nbladder neck, are available in Europe.\n\n[ corrected] Urethral plugs are devices that are inserted into the urethra to\nprevent urine loss during activities that cause stress incontinence (e.g.,\nrunning).42 They are available in two lengths: 3.5 cm and 4.5 cm. There is\nlimited evidence promoting or discouraging their use,43 and they are\nassociated with a number of adverse effects, including urinary tract infection\n(occurring in up to 31 percent of women over a two-year period), hematuria (3\npercent), and migration into the bladder (1 percent).42 Despite this, multi-\nyear studies indicate a high degree of patient satisfaction, and the\nlikelihood of significant adverse effects diminishes with continued use.43\n\n### PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY\n\nNo medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of stress incontinence.\nAlpha-adrenergic agonists, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, cause\nurethral constriction and, in theory, should decrease stress incontinence.3\nHowever, there is only weak evidence to support their superiority over\nplacebo.3,44 Adverse effects range from insomnia and anxiety to hypertension,\narrhythmias, and stroke.44\n\nAlthough it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of stress incontinence, the\nantidepressant duloxetine (Cymbalta) has been shown to reduce stress\nincontinence,45 but there is no evidence that it generates cure. Most women\ndiscontinue therapy within four weeks, citing adverse effects (45 percent) or\nlack of effectiveness (24 percent).10,35 Given some evidence of benefit,\nhowever, a patient who has stress incontinence and who is a candidate for\nantidepressant treatment may receive dual benefit from duloxetine. Other\nantidepressants demonstrate no objective improvement in incontinence.35\n\n### MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES\n\nRadiofrequency denaturation is a nonsurgical modality that uses a device\ninserted into the urethra to deliver radiofrequency energy. This energy\ndenatures collagen in the bladder neck and proximal urethra, causing a\nreduction in compliance of those structures. The onetime procedure can be\nperformed with local anesthesia in a physician's office. Cure rates range from\n22 to 67 percent, and more than 50 percent of patients report symptom\nimprovement up to three years after a single treatment.11,46,47 The procedure\nis safe, with the most common adverse effects including dysuria and urinary\ntract infections.11,47\n\nInjection of bulking agents is a minimally invasive procedure for women with\nintrinsic weakness of the urethral sphincter whose symptoms do not respond to\nnoninvasive treatments and who cannot undergo surgery. Agents such as\nautologous fat, collagen, or carbon beads are injected through a needle placed\ntransurethrally or periurethrally. Cure or improvement rates range from 18 to\n40 percent, with repeated injections required to maintain effectiveness.\nAdverse effects include urinary retention, urgency, dysuria, and urinary tract\ninfections.11\n\n### SURGERY\n\nSurgery is reserved for incontinence that does not respond to less invasive\ntreatments.6 About 30 percent of women with stress incontinence ultimately\nelect to undergo surgery.48 Adverse outcomes include perioperative\ncomplications, development of urgency and urge incontinence, pelvic organ\nprolapse, and need for repeat surgery.\n\nSurgical options include slings and urethropexy. Sling procedures include\npubovaginal slings and midurethral slings (i.e., retropubic sling, single\nincision sling [mini-sling], tension-free vaginal tape, and transobturator\nsling). Urethropexy options include needle urethropexy and retropubic\nurethropexy (i.e., Burch and Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedures). There is\nno consensus on the best surgical approach. All methods aim to augment\nurethral closure, or support and stabilize the bladder neck and\nurethra.12,33,48,49 One of the most commonly performed approaches is the use\nof tension-free vaginal tape. In this outpatient procedure, with the patient\nunder local anesthesia, the tape is inserted to create a sling around the\nurethra. Because of its acceptable adverse effect profile, demonstrated\neffectiveness, and durability, some are considering tension-free vaginal tape\nthe new standard for surgical treatment of stress incontinence.12\n\n**Data Sources:** We consulted general clinical review articles on the\nsubject, and searched the Cochrane database, Agency for Healthcare Research\nand Quality, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse, as well as pertinent\narticles from reference bibliographies.
