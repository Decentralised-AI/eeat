DeFi\n\n# Native Bitcoin in DeFi \u2014 This DEX Wants to Boost Trust\n\nThorChain teams up with Trust Wallet to capture millions of potential new DeFi\nusers\n\nby Macauley Peterson /\n\nDecember 15, 2022 03:30 pm\n\nMuhammed AKAN/Shutterstock.com modified by Blockworks\n\nshare\n\nThe hidden costs of centralization have been on display in spades this year,\nbetween the bankruptcies of centralized lending platforms and exchanges,\nespecially FTX. Non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX) ThorChain,\nmeanwhile, has flown under the radar \u2014 despite its unique connection to\nBitcoin and growing user base.\n\nThe DEX is known for being the first \u2014 and by far the largest \u2014 to facilitate\ncross-chain swaps between native bitcoin and other networks. Previously, this\nkind of cross-chain asset transfer required a centralized exchange like\nBinance or Coinbase: Deposit bitcoin, sell for ether and withdraw to Ethereum\n\u2014 or use a custodial wrapped asset, such as WBTC, on Ethereum.\n\nThat\u2019s the main problem that developers of ThorChain \u2014 which is based on the\nCosmos software development kit (SDK) \u2014 set out to solve. The network beta\nversion launched in April, 2021.\n\n> **\u201cInstead of trying to bring bitcoin to DeFi via a wrapped asset, let\u2019s\n> bring DeFi to bitcoin,\u201d Chad Barraford, the project\u2019s technical lead, told\n> Blockworks.**\n\nThe DEX is conceptually \u201casset agnostic,\u201d with Barraford likening the notion\nof being locked into any one crypto ecosystem as \u201clike being a computer\nmanufacturer that will only sell to Japan.\u201d\n\nThere have been some forks \u2014 attempts to improve on ThorChain\u2019s open-source\ncode \u2014 such as Maya Protocol, and Chainflip, but, according to Barraford,\n\u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a design for interacting with bitcoin that maintains\neconomic security, other than ThorChain.\u201d\n\n### Improving the utility of Bitcoin and DeFi user experience\n\nThorChain\u2019s integration with Trust Wallet, a self-custodial, multi-chain\nwallet provider, is a move to expand the user base of both: Trust Wallet \u2014\nwhich is owned by the world\u2019s largest centralized exchange, Binance \u2014 brings\n10 million active users, a spokesperson told Blockworks. Thorchain, meanwhile,\nhas logged about 62,000 addresses and 9.3 million transactions over its\nhistory, according to the latest data.\n\nBlockworks Research analyst Dan Smith said the integration is a significant\nstep.\n\n\u201cPeople like simplicity,\u201d Smith said. \u201c[You] don\u2019t have to use a site you are\nunfamiliar with.\u201d\n\nThorChain, after all, hovers among the top four options in terms of bridge\nvolume, and even did a stint at No. 2 during the peak of the November FTX-\ndriven sell off.\n\nThe biggest problem, as many DeFi projects are discovering, is liquidity,\naccording to Barraford.\n\n\u201cThe more shallow the pools are, the higher the swap fees will be,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe do a slip-based fee model, not a straight 30 [basis points] like Uniswap].\nAt some stage it\u2019ll be uncompetitive, like right now the pools are very very\nshallow, largely because it\u2019s a bear market.\u201d\n\nThat pushes up transaction fees as a result of slippage between traded assets.\nIf ThorChain can attract enough liquidity, the swap fees can drop to become\neven cheaper than Binance, as they already were during the height of the last\nbull market.\n\nA new product, \u201cSavers\u201d, launched in November, allows native bitcoin to be\nincluded in liquidity pools \u2014 without the risk of impermanent loss, or the\nneed to whole any of Thorchain\u2019s native token, RUNE.\n\nThat should appeal to bitcoiners, Barraford said, \u201cwho want to earn BTC on\ntheir BTC\u201d but have no interest in RUNE as an asset.\n\nThe eventual goal, he said, is DEX aggregation \u2014 giving users the ability to\nconduct multiple cross-chain swaps in a single transaction, would be a huge\nimprovement to user experience.\n\n### Promoting DEX benefits\n\nThe turmoil associated with the downfall of FTX and other centralized parties\nmay help refocus attention on truly decentralized projects.\n\n\u201cUsers are now more motivated than ever to capitalize on the benefits of self-\ncustody,\u201d Barraford said in a statement. \u201cThe latest market developments\nemphasize the importance of transparency and self-custody, features that are\ninherent in decentralized finance (DeFi).\u201d\n\nThere are even efforts to bring institutional capital into the ThorChain\nsphere, with firms such as Nine Realms, whose CEO Gavin McDermott commented\nthat, \u201cbeyond the philosophical appeal of self-custody, people will use\nTHORChain because it provides an excellent user experience and feature parity\nwith centralized counterparts.\u201d\n\nThe biggest risk to the ThorChain narrative seems to be its complexity. Even\nsophisticated crypto builders like Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko\nhave been confounded by its economic design.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThis claim \u2014 that \u201cit carries similar risks as [Wormhole]\u201d \u2014 is objectively\nfalse according Smith, who said, \u201crisks do certainly exist, but very\ndifferent,\u201d with ThorChain.\n\n\u201cEconomic security is so important,\u201d Barraford said. Theoretically, a hacker\nwould need to simultaneously compromise the private keys of all of ThorChain\u2019s\ndecentralized active nodes \u2014 currently 86 of them \u2014 to steal the network\u2019s\nassets. But the validators themselves must escrow a security bond in RUNE such\nthat their own economic incentives prevent malicious action.\n\nOtherwise, it would certainly spell trouble for the ThorChain token, but\nthat\u2019s by design \u2014 it also keeps network participants honest. Thus, the token\nis a critical part of what makes native cross-chain swaps possible.\n\n\u201cThe value of the RUNE that I bought would go to zero\u2026We needed an asset that\nwould go to zero, in order to maintain economic security.\u201d Barraford said.\n\n_**Update, Dec. 15, 11:54 p.m. ET** \u2014 Yakovenko elaborated in a follow-up\ntweet that he was referring not to ThorChain\u2019s economic design, but to the\nrisk of an unnoticed remote code execution (RCE) \u2014 a malicious bug \u2014 in the\nnode software or hardware._\n\n* * *\n\n**Don\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our  free daily newsletter.**\n\nTags\n\n  * Binance\n  * Bitcoin\n  * bridges\n  * DEX\n  * ThorChain\n  * Trust Wallet\n\nNewsletter\n\nBlockworks Daily\n\nSubscribe\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nPermissionless III\n\nWED - FRI, OCTOBER 9 - 11, 2024\n\nPack your bags, anon \u2014 we\u2019re heading west!
