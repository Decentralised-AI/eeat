Just scroll down to the next section, if you\u2019re already well-versed in\nthat topic._\n\nA cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where you can buy and/or sell crypto\nassets, like BTC or DOT. You might have had some experience with regular\ntrading platforms, and crypto exchanges function quite similarly to them. Some\nexchanges offer advanced trading features like derivatives trading. For\nexample, Dexilon provides its users with the ability to trade crypto options,\ncrypto futures, and also some exotic derivatives.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of the TOP decentralized exchanges:\n\n  1. Dexilon \u2013 Best DEX for Crypto Derivatives\n  2. Bisq \u2013 Best DEX for Smaller Trades\n  3. dYdX \u2013 Best Exchange for Margin Trading\n  4.

Curve Finance \u2013 Best DEX for Stablecoins \n  8. DODO \u2013 Best Proactive Market (PMM) Maker Exchange\n  9. Balancer \u2013 Best Flexible DEX\n  10. Apex Protocol \u2013 Best New DeFi Platform\n\nIf you wonder what are the types of crypto exchanges, there are roughly two of\nthem \u2013 centralized and decentralized exchanges, and we\u2019re going to focus on\nthe second one in this article. But let us describe both of them briefly to\ncompare.\n\n## Best decentralized Bitcoin exchanges \u2013 is it better to choose a DEX or a\nCEX?\n\nThis part might not be helpful for those who have already decided on either of\nthe two types of crypto exchanges, but if you still try to decide if you\nshould choose the best decentralized bitcoin exchange or the best centralized\none, here are the main distinctions between them.\n\n**Centralized exchanges** (CEXs) are controlled by an organization. One of the\nbiggest advantages of centralized exchanges is that they allow users to trade\ntheir fiat currency like EUR or USD into crypto assets.\n\nAs a user of the CEX, you will have to go through the KYC (Know Your Customer)\nprocess. This means that before you get to exchange your crypto, you will have\nto get verified by the platform which involves providing them with your\npersonal information, like your address and ID details. This KYC policy is\naimed at tackling cyberattacks and securing everyone\u2019s assets. However, the\nmoney being held by a centralized entity inevitably puts it at risk of being\nstolen by hackers.\n\nThese days, the majority of crypto trading transactions are being performed on\ncentralized exchanges. Primarily because this type of exchange appeared first.\nHowever, it has some disadvantages, including security issues, which became\nthe reason why decentralized exchanges appeared on the market over time.\n\n**Decentralized exchanges** (DEX) are much more autonomous than centralized\nexchanges. They run on smart contracts, and computer protocols that execute,\ncontrol, and document transactions under specific circumstances. DEXs allow\nanonymity and flexibility for users since there are usually no KYC\nrequirements.\n\nWhen you hold your crypto on a centralized exchange, it takes control of your\nfunds. With the DEX though, you stay in control of your assets and, thus, this\nis considered a safer way to trade crypto. With most DeFi exchanges, you trade\ndirectly from the wallet connected to the platform. One of the biggest\ndownsides of decentralized exchanges is that you won\u2019t be able to exchange\nyour fiat currency for crypto, so you need to hold some crypto in your crypto\nwallet, like MetaMask before you try to exchange it for the other currency on\nthe platform.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to learn about the biggest benefits of the best decentralized\nexchanges.\n\n## Best decentralized crypto exchanges \u2013 what are their advantages?\n\nBest decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges have several benefits that make\nthem more and more attractive to users. Take a look at the list below.\n\n  * **The range of assets available.** One of the biggest perks of DEXs is that you usually get access to a tremendous number of coins. It\u2019s much easier to add new coins to a decentralized exchange, as centralized ones require going through a complicated verification process. So new coins usually emerge much faster on decentralized exchanges and before this coin grows in price, you can be one of the lucky dogs, who gets it for a very reasonable price.\n  * **Anonymity and better privacy**. DEXs usually don\u2019t follow a KYC protocol, so you do not need to submit your personal data to a decentralized exchange, so your data won\u2019t be stolen or violated. \n  * **Much lower fees**. The exchange does not hold your assets as an intermediary, which means that there\u2019s less work involved on their side, so the fees are usually lower.\n\nDecentralized exchanges were created as a response to the restrictions of the\ncentralized ones and made them available to a wider audience of crypto\nenthusiasts and, despite their own limitations, they are gaining more\npopularity. Since there\u2019s a huge number of decentralized exchanges these days,\nyou need to know the most important criteria to choose the best dex\ncryptocurrency exchange available on the market. Keep reading to learn more.\n\n## Best DEX exchanges \u2013 the criteria for choosing a perfect platform you won\u2019t\nregret joining\n\nWhen choosing the best dex crypto exchanges, you need to be aware of what you\nshould be looking at. To be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, there\nare roughly 7 factors you need to check to make sure the platform is reliable\nand legit. You are free to prioritize them depending on your needs and\npreferences.\n\n  * **Fees and their transparency**. Fees are never a pleasant thing, but they are deeply frustrating if they eat up a lump sum of your rewards. So make sure you study the fees of the exchange you\u2019re choosing before you invest any money. If the platform doesn\u2019t openly describe its fees, it\u2019s automatically a red flag \u2013 you came to DeFi for transparency, didn\u2019t you?\n  * **Security**. Even though your money is not held by the exchange, it\u2019s essential to choose an exchange that takes safety seriously. Cybercriminals are evolving along with security measures, so choose an exchange that uses the latest and most reliable achievements of security software.\n  * **Supported coins.** If you\u2019re into trying new assets, and it\u2019s important for you to be able to trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies, you should look for a platform that supports a wide range of coins. However, if you\u2019re one of those who prefer to let others test the waters, and usually stick to the trusted assets, choose any of the five exchanges below, they have more than enough.\n  * **Payment methods.** It\u2019s important when you can buy crypto using a convenient way of payment. Especially, if you\u2019re new to crypto, it\u2019s important to have at least a small area where you know what to do and how to do it. So look for an exchange that supports the most suitable payment method personally for you.\n  * **Customer service**. Seems like one of the least important factors on the list, but, believe me, you don\u2019t want to have an indifferent person on the line or, which is even worse, didn\u2019t get any response when you have some issues with your transactions. \n  * **Customer reviews**. I doubted if I have to write it because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now \u2013 gathering information and trying to figure out what is the best decentralized exchange for crypto. But you can go one step further. For example, type in Google \u201cbest decentralized exchange Reddit\u201d to read the real discussions of the crypto enthusiast who tried different exchanges and chose the one.\n\nAnd now the moment came \u2013 we\u2019ll break down 5 crypto DEXs and let you define\nyour best decentralized exchange for crypto. They all have their benefits and\ndownsides, so as I\u2019ve written earlier, we can\u2019t decide which one suits your\nneeds best \u2013 you\u2019ll need to do it on your own.\n\n## Best decentralized exchange to buy crypto\n\nWe\u2019ve studied the market and prepared a list of 10 exchanges that are worth\ntrying.

The taker fee\nranges from 1,5 to 5 bps, whereas there is a rebate of 1 bps. 20% of this\ndifference is an oracle reward. If we take a median of 3 bps, the oracle will\nreceive 0,4 bps (3-1)*20% of a taker fee. These rewards are accumulated on the\nDexilon chain and are redistributed every 8 hours.\n\nDexilon oracle requires a set of nodes that will validate the data collected\nfrom data providers. For this, this chain will get 30% of the rewards. The\nrest will go to data providers.\n\nAnother cool thing about this exchange is that they also provide the users\nwith the chance to learn about how the exchange works without investing a\nsingle Bitcoin \u2013 a Testnet they launched recently, despite not being packed\nwith multiple features, teaches you the basics.

For example, it\u2019s a first-of-\nits-kind crypto derivatives exchange that focuses exclusively on crowdsourced\nliquidity. This means that when you deposit collateral in order to open a\nleveraged trading position, you\u2019re borrowing funds from a liquidity pool that\nconsists fully of the crypto deposited by traders. **  \n**\n\n  \n**Pros**\n\n    * No gas costs are charged\n    * Ease of use \u2013 well-thought UX\n\n******Cons**\n\n    * Limited number of trading pairs\n    * Deposits and withdrawals are only in crypto  \n\n  4. ### PancakeSwap\n\nPancakeSwap seems to be the most popular exchange for finding new\ncryptocurrencies due to the platform\u2019s simple listing process.
