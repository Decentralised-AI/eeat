Read less\n\nA decentralized exchange (DEX) is a digital currency exchange that allows\nusers to buy crypto through direct, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions,\nall over a online platform without an intermediary. It differs from a\ntraditional centralized exchange, where a typical transaction involves a\nthird-party entity (e.g. bank, trading platform, government institution, etc.)\nthat takes custody of user funds, and oversees the security and transfer of\nassets between two parties.\n\nDecentralization is a fundamental philosophy of blockchain technology and the\ncrypto space. It redistributes authority from a central power, and places it\nin the hands of users. And the concept of decentralization is reengineering\nhow many conventional financial services operate.\n\nDecentralized exchanges have also grown in popularity over the past couple of\nyears, with spot trading volume slowly shifting away from centralized\nexchanges, up until early 2022, when \u201ccrypto winter\u201d set in.\n\nSpot Trading Volume Percentage, DEX vs. CEX  \n---  \nTimeframe\n\n| CEX\n\n| DEX  \n  \nJanuary 2020 | 98.93% | 1.07%  \nJune 2020 | 97.01% | 2.99%  \nJanuary 2021 | 93.22% | 6.78%  \nJune 2021 | 93.2% | 6.8%  \nJanuary 2022 | 77.08% | 22.92%  \nJune 2022 | 82.93% | 17.07%  \n  \n## How a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Works\n\nDecentralized exchanges provide a decentralized platform that allows users to\nexchange assets without having to trust their funds with another entity.\n\nWith a decentralized exchange, a blockchain, or distributed ledger, takes the\nplace of the third party. By moving critical operations onto a blockchain, the\nunderlying technology may help to eliminate single points of failure, allowing\nusers to have greater control of their assets, and support safer and more\ntransparent trading.\n\nDEXs use smart contracts to execute market transactions by allocating\ntransactions\u2019 operations to autonomous code, but there are multiple variations\nof order fulfillment with differing degrees of decentralization.\n\nLike digital currencies, decentralized exchanges were created in response to\nflawed and archaic financial systems that passed along risks of a centralized\nsystem to its users. Those risks often include insufficient security,\ntechnical issues, and a lack of transparency.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 _**Recommended:Crypto Guide for Beginners**_\n\n## Different Types of Decentralized Exchanges\n\nFull decentralization is more of a philosophy than a rule of thumb, as it\u2019s\nnot very practical based on first-layer blockchain scalability limits. As a\nresult, most decentralized exchanges are actually semi-decentralized, using\ntheir own servers and off-chain order books to store data and external\nprograms or entities for the exchange of user assets.\n\nDue to this reliance on centralized components, semi-decentralized exchanges\u2019\noperations may be subject to government oversight. However, and perhaps most\nimportantly, users still maintain control of the private keys to their funds.\n\nAlthough DEXs continue to evolve and operate cross-chain with other DApps,\nDEXs typically operate a single blockchain. One thing all decentralized\nexchanges have in common is that they execute orders on chains with smart\ncontracts, and at no point do they take custody of users\u2019 funds.\n\nThe Different Types of DEXs  \n---  \nType\n\n| Features  \n  \nOn-Chain Order Books | Processes transactions on a blockchain network, without\nthe inclusion of a third-party  \nOff-Chain Order Books | Utilizes an off-chain, centralized entity to process\ntransactions and govern the order book  \nAutomated Market Makers | Uses algorithms to automatically price asset pairs\nin real-time  \nDEX Aggregators | Compile data from numerous DEXs to increase options and\nliquidity for traders  \n  \n### On-Chain Order Books\n\nFor some decentralized exchanges, transactions are processed on-chain,\nincluding modifying and canceling orders. Philosophically, this is the most\ndecentralized and transparent process, because it circumvents the need to\ntrust a third party to handle any orders at any time. However, this approach\nis not very practical in execution.\n\nBy placing all stages of an order onto the blockchain, DEXs go through a time-\nconsuming process of asking every node on the network to permanently store the\norder via miners, as well as pay a fee.\n\nSome criticize the decentralized crypto exchange model because its slow\ntransaction times allow for front-running, which is when an investor watches\nthe price of an asset closely, waiting at the last minute to buy or sell right\nbefore they anticipate the price rising or falling. (Note that this type of\n\u201cfront-running\u201d is different from stock front-running, where an investor\npurchases a security based on insider information, such as a future event that\nwill impact stock price.)\n\nOthers counter that since all orders are published on a public ledger, there\nis no exclusive opportunity for any select individual to front-run from a\ntraditional perspective. However, it has been questioned whether a miner can\nfront-run by noticing an order before it\u2019s confirmed and force their own order\nto get added to the blockchain first.\n\n### Off-Chain Order Books\n\nDEXs with off-chain order books are still decentralized to some degree, but\nare somewhat more centralized than their on-chain counterparts. As opposed to\norders being stored on the blockchain, off-chain orders are posted elsewhere,\nsuch as a centralized entity that governs the order book. Such an entity could\nexploit access to the order books to front-run or misrepresent orders,\nhowever, users\u2019 funds would still be protected from the DEXs non-custodial\nmodel.\n\nSome ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain provide a DEX that operates\nsimilarly. Though some degree of decentralization is sacrificed, a DEX can\nprovide a framework for parties to manage off-chain order books through smart\ncontracts. Hosts can then access a larger liquidity pool and relay orders\nbetween traders. Once the parties are matched, the trade can be executed on-\nchain.\n\nThese models can be more advantageous for users than relying on slower on-\nchain order books. With less congestion and quicker confirmation times caused\nby primitive blockchain iterations, off-chain order books can provide faster\nspeeds.\n\n### Automated Market Makers (AMM)\n\nAn automated market maker (AMM) reinvents order books with pricing algorithms\nthat automatically price any asset pairing in real-time (e.g. Bitcoin-U.S.\ndollar).\n\nUnlike traditional market-making, whereby firms provide an accurate price and\na tight spread on an order book, AMMs decentralize this process and allow\nusers to create a market on a blockchain. No counterparty is needed to make a\ntrade, as the AMM simply interacts with a blockchain to \u201ccreate\u201d a market.\nInstead of transacting directly with another person, exchange, or market-\nmaker, users trade with smart contracts and provide liquidity. Unfortunately,\nthere are no order types on an AMM because prices are algorithmically\ndetermined, resulting in a sort of market order.\n\nAs with other DEX models, an on-chain transaction must occur to settle any\ntrade. As opposed to some DEXs, AMMs tend to be relatively user-friendly and\nintegrate with popular cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n### DEX Aggregators\n\nDEX aggregators are precisely what they sound like: aggregators that compile\nvarious trading pools. Their main advantage is that they can increase\nliquidity for traders, particularly for those who are looking to expand their\noptions or trade smaller tokens.\n\nHow these aggregators work is similar to a search engine, in that they compile\nand accumulate information and data from different exchanges to give users\nmore options.\n\n## Tips for Using Decentralized Exchanges\n\nUsing a DEX has its advantages and risks. While you\u2019re likely using a DEX for\nits advantages, it\u2019s important to keep those risks in mind. Perhaps most\nimportantly, remember that decentralized exchanges are, for all intents and\npurposes, operating off the radar and outside of regulatory authorities.\n\nAlso remember that as the popularity of DeFi as a whole grows, so too will the\nuse of DEXs, and their features and functions. These are changing platforms\nand technologies, so do some research to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing,\nand that you\u2019re keeping your keys, phrases, and assets safe.\n\n## Pros of Decentralized Exchanges\n\nThere are many reasons fans and followers of crypto have embraced\ndecentralized exchanges. These are some of the pros of decentralized\nexchanges:\n\n### No KYC/AML or ID Verification\n\nDEXs are trustless, meaning users\u2019 funds, privacy, and limited personal data\nare well preserved. Decentralized exchange users can easily and securely\naccess a DEX without needing to create an on-exchange account, undergo\nidentity verification, or provide personal information.\n\n### No Counterparty Risk\n\nBecause users don\u2019t have to transfer their assets to an exchange (or third\nparty), decentralized exchanges can reduce risks of theft and loss of funds\ndue to hacks. DEXs can also prevent price manipulation or fake trading volume,\nand allow users to maintain a degree of anonymity due to a lack of Know Your\nCustomer (KYC) cryptocurrency rules and regulations.\n\n### All Tokens Can be Traded\n\nWith a DEX, users can trade new and obscure cryptocurrencies that may be\ndifficult to exchange elsewhere. Typically, centralized exchanges only support\na dozen or so projects, and most only support the most popular\ncryptocurrencies, making smaller and less popular tokens more difficult to\ntrade, especially as those exchanges restrict users from other countries.\n\n### Reduced Security Risks\n\nAs mentioned, decentralized exchanges may be more secure than their\ncentralized counterparts. That\u2019s because no single entity is in charge of\nassets, and instead, smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps)\nautomate transactions. It\u2019s all handled by users, in other words, making it\nvery difficult for a hacker or bad actor to infiltrate a centralized pile of\nassets and steal them.\n\nThat said, a bad or poorly developed smart contract could cause issues, which\nis something to be aware of.\n\n### Utility in the Developing World\n\nMany parts of the world lack basic financial services, nevermind access to the\ncrypto markets. That\u2019s another pro for DEXs, which can be used by individuals\nanywhere in the world regardless of financial infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, DEXs may be the most beneficial to users in the developing world,\ngiving businesses a way to transact assets without the need for a third party,\nwhere those parties may not be available or willing to operate.\n\n## Cons of a Decentralized Exchange\n\nWhile decentralized exchanges offer some groundbreaking benefits, they also\ncome with a few drawbacks.\n\n### Specific Knowledge Is Required\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around it: You\u2019ll need to know what you\u2019re doing, at least\nto a degree, to use a decentralized exchange. Centralized exchanges exist for\na reason: They\u2019re relatively easy to use, and handle most of the complicated\nstuff for users. But when using a DEX, it\u2019s all on the user. There\u2019s no hand-\nholding, and as such, you\u2019ll want to be confident that you know the ropes\nbefore using a DEX.\n\n### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities\n\nAnother thing we previously mentioned is the fact that smart contracts may be\npoorly constructed, leading to problems on a DEX. A smart contract is only as\nsmart as the person or entity that created it, and there\u2019s no guarantee that\nit will work as hoped all of the time.\n\nSmart contracts themselves are similar to bits of code or commands that\nautomate a process, and if there\u2019s an error in the smart contract, it could\nproduce unanticipated results.\n\n### No Recovery Ability\n\nUnlike centralized exchanges run by private companies with employees, DEXs\nfundamentally have no recovery ability for lost, stolen, or misplaced funds.\nDue to a lack of a KYC process or ability to cancel a transaction in the event\nof a compromised account or loss of private key, users are unable to recover\ndata or be returned their assets.\n\nAs discussed, there is no support team or help hotline to notify of missing\nfunds or a lost private key, as users themselves are in control of the\nprocess. Because all transactions are processed and stored in smart contracts\non the blockchain without any owners or overseers, refunds are incompatible\nwith the network\u2019s model and users are generally unable to regain access to\ntheir assets.\n\n### Unvetted Token Listings\n\nThe crypto space is rife with scams and junk tokens, and given that there\u2019s no\ncentral authority in a DEX, it\u2019s relatively easy for some of those junk tokens\nor coins to find themselves in the listings. Put another way: There is little\nor no vetting process for what\u2019s listed on a DEX (though it may differ from\nexchange to exchange). Making sure you\u2019re not falling for a scam coin, then,\nis on the user.\n\n### Low Liquidity\n\nMany traders prefer centralized services with a greater liquidity pool, choice\nof instruments, currency pairs, and order types. Decentralized exchanges\nusually have lower liquidity than centralized platforms because they are newer\nand smaller, with a smaller potential client base (since DEXs are more\ndifficult to use than CEXs). Yet, paradoxically, they must also attract new\nusers to generate more liquidity.\n\n### Limited Speed\n\nTransactions take time to be checked and validated on a blockchain network,\nand the processing speed depends on the network\u2019s miners or validators, not\nthe exchange itself.\n\n### Limited Trading Functionality\n\nDecentralized exchanges tend to focus on executing simple buy and sell orders.\nAs such, users may find advanced trading functions such as stop losses, margin\ntrading, and lending are unavailable on most DEXs.\n\n### Scalability Issues\n\nDEXs have suffered from the same network congestion issues relating to\nscalability issues as their underlying blockchain networks like Ethereum.\nEthereum\u2019s first network iteration, like other blockchains, was built to\nfunction securely at a smaller scale before scaling solutions were later\nimplemented. Though a transformative network upgrade designed with massive\nscalability solutions has been in development since 2018, DEXs remain subject\nto first-layer network transaction ceilings.\n\n## Challenges to DEX Adoption\n\nWith sophisticated technology, potentially fewer blockchain security risks,\nand the ability to self-custody funds, further adoption of decentralized\nexchanges seems likely. But DEXs, for the most part, remain out of the\nmainstream. Despite the launch and rise in popularity of numerous DEXs within\nthe past few years, some factors may slow down adoption.\n\nMany investors may lack awareness surrounding:\n\n\u2022   The security risks of centralized exchanges\n\n\u2022   Self-custody as a security option\n\n\u2022   How to securely self-custody funds (managing private keys)\n\n\u2022   The existence of decentralized exchanges\n\n\u2022   The advantages of decentralized exchanges\n\nDEXs also present a few technical barriers to entry:\n\n\u2022   Not user-friendly enough\n\n\u2022   Network congestion during periods of high volume\n\n\u2022   Transactions on current network iterations take time to be validated on\nblockchains\n\n\u2022   High transactions fees during periods of high volume\n\n\u2022   Users will only join a DEX with high liquidity\n\n\u2022   Cross-chain interoperability must exist for DeFi platforms to interact\nwith each other\n\n\u2022   The need for fiat on-ramps and less volatile token prices\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nDecentralized exchanges are a trustless solution that allows users to buy and\nsell cryptocurrency without roping in a third party. Though full\ndecentralization is not yet a reality, different types of DEXs provide varying\nlevels of security, privacy, and efficiency from which crypto traders can\nchoose.\n\nAs DEXs continue to develop, evolve, and become more practical for users, user\nadoption may become a focal point as DEXs look to offer greater liquidity. The\ngood news is that DEXs present only one of numerous ways to get involved in\nthe crypto space.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do DEX fees work?\n\nA DEX facilitates peer-to-peer trading, and levies network fees in order to\nfacilitate those transactions. While fees from DEX to DEX may vary, they\ndiffer from centralized exchanges, which may charge trading fees or\ncommissions for executing transactions.\n\n### What\u2019s the difference between a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a\ncentralized exchange (CEX)?\n\nA decentralized exchange allows individual users to connect and transact\nassets without a third party. A centralized exchange, conversely, acts as a\nthird party and takes custody of funds or assets during the transaction. The\nkey difference is that a CEX acts as a central authority.\n\n### Are decentralized exchanges legal?\n\nYes, DEXs are legal, though they do operate in something of a gray area (like\nmost of the crypto space) in that they\u2019re unregulated by a central government\nauthority. Some exchanges may be illegal in certain jurisdictions, too. That\nmay change in the future, though, as regulators outline plans and potential\nrules for the crypto space.\n\n### How can I create a decentralized exchange?\n\nIf you want to create your own DEX, you\u2019ll need a lot of background knowledge\ninvolving blockchain architecture and more. You would need to know how to\ncode, identify key features that your DEX would have, and much, much more.\nYou\u2019re likely better off using an existing DEX, rather than creating one from\nscratch.\n\n* * *\n\n**SoFi Invest\u00ae**  \nThe information provided is not meant to provide investment or financial\nadvice.
