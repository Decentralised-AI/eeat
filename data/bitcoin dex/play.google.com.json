Which I would love to see. However it's\nadvertised as a multi chain wallet. And currently everything is in bep20. I\nknow its still being developed, but probably should focus on adding other\nchains. It would be really interesting to see the active bridge concept and\nalso being able to connect the wallet to outside defi products. Could be a\ngame changer to be able to cash out/buy crypto in the wallet instead of an\nexchange. Cutting the middle man out.\n\n8 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nGyanex Emmanuel\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nThis project will make people millionaires very soon. The reason giving four\nstar is, I can't see dapp and some function I saw on the pictures provided\nhere on the real app I have now. The team is superp. The app run fast too.\nLooking forward to see more function on the app as seen in the pictures.\n\n5 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nShindoux\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n\nDecember 3, 2022\n\nThis crypto wallet is very neat and smooth.
