Unlike\ncentralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs do not require a trusted third party, or\nintermediary, to facilitate the exchange of cryptoassets.  \n  \nA core tenet of crypto is the disintermediation of finance, because it\nincreases the economic freedom of individuals everywhere in the world no\nmatter who they may be.
