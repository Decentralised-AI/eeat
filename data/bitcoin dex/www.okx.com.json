While crypto projects sought\ndecentralization, users could only trade assets on centralized exchanges\n(CEXs). Over the years, developers tried to build decentralized exchanges\n(DEXs), but these attempts were largely unsuccessful. The main issue with DEXs\nback then was the need for more liquidity.\n\nThis changed with the launch of Uniswap, which started using Automated Market\nMaker (AMM) to build up liquidity. Suddenly, a new era of DEXs started, and\ntoday, there's a wide selection of DEXs. This guide will explain what DEXs are\nand how they work. It will also include a list of some of the best\ndecentralized exchanges available.\n\nGet started\n\n## What is a decentralized exchange?\n\nDecentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer (P2P) swapping platforms not run by a\ncentralized entity. DEXs are similar to centralized platforms in some ways\nbut, for the most part, are significantly different. Some of the major\ndifferences include that they are not owned and operated by a single entity.\nThey do not require you to deposit funds into their wallet to trade. In other\nwords, they are non-custodial trading platforms.\n\nDEXs also only offer assets that run on the same blockchain as the exchange.\nHowever, cross-chain DEXs can also use assets from different chains.\nDecentralized exchanges are run via smart contracts and do not require order\nbooks to match traders. Instead, they use AMMs and liquidity pools from where\nthey draw the funds offered by other users. DEXs also tend to provide\nsignificantly lower trading fees and greater security.\n\n## 17 Best decentralized exchanges available right now\n\n### 1\\. Uniswap\n\nThe first on the list of the best decentralized exchanges is Uniswap \u2014\nEthereum's first and largest DEX. Uniswap is a strong choice for those who\nwish to grow their assets. The platform is extremely popular; its average\ndaily volume often exceeds $4 billion. As an AMM DEX, Uniswap manages its\ndecentralized liquidity pool through an algorithm. Its purpose is to determine\nthe best swap rate for each trading pair.Customers can use established\nliquidity pools or even create their own. Those who provide liquidity \u2014\nliquidity providers \u2014 earn by receiving a portion of the trading fees. The\nplatform is entirely governed by a decentralized autonomous organization\n(DAO), meaning its users are in control.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Offers more than 400 tokens\n\n  * A large, reputable, and established exchange platform\n\n  * High trading volume\n\n  * DAO-governed\n\n  * Users can generate passive earnings through staking\n\n  * Transaction fees from 0.1% to 1%\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * No fiat transactions\n\n  * The risk of impermanent loss is always present\n\n  * Gas fees\n\n###  **2\\. OKX DEX**\n\nNext, we have _OKX DEX_ \u2014 a cross-chain, multi-chain DEX aggregator that aims\nto provide users with the optimal transaction from across 20+ chains, 300+ DEX\nand 200,000+ coins. OKX's DEX features a decentralized, borderless trading\nplatform that is secure and non-custodial.\n\nThe _OKX DEX_ can offer a seamless trading experience and relatively low\ntrading fees. Its chain focuses on providing a better, more dedicated\ninfrastructure than Ethereum. This makes it an attractive option for DApps,\nDEXs, and other blockchain products.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * High security\n\n  * Non-custodial platform\n\n  * Great exchange rates\n\n  * Order matching through a call auction mechanism\n\n  * User-friendly design\n\n  * Decentralized governance\n\n  * Approval-free listing\n\n  * Cross-chain gateway\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Low liquidity for certain cryptocurrencies\n\n  * Commissions are not displayed until the order is created\n\n###  **3\\. ApeX Pro**\n\nApeX Pro is known as one of the best decentralized exchanges due to its\nelastic AMM model. This model improves capital efficiency and makes\ntransactions feel like spot trading. It also features an order book interface,\nwhich makes it easier for beginners to use. The platform integrates\nStarkWare's layer 2 scalability engine, contributing to the exchange's\nsecurity. If the DEX is ever out of service, traders can use the engine to\nretrieve their funds. It even features up to 20x leverage for any token on the\nderivatives market.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * High performance\n\n  * Security and privacy\n\n  * Low fees\n\n  * High leverage\n\n  * Order book model\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Limited trading instruments\n\n  * It doesn't have tiered fees\n\n###  **4\\. Curve**\n\nCurve is one of the best DEXs for traders worried about volatility. Curve is\nanother AMM DEX, and like Uniswap, it uses Ethereum's decentralized network.\nHowever, it's also unique in some aspects. It features its token, CRV, which\nis used for governance by granting voting rights to its holders.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Offers over 45 tokens\n\n  * Transaction fees are at around 0.04%\n\n  * Token holders get to vote on important decisions\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * A steep learning curve due to complex interface\n\n  * High gas fees\n\n###  **5\\. KyberSwap**\n\nFifth on the list of the best DEXs is KyberSwap. This is the flagship product\nof the Kyber Network. Commonly compared to Uniswap, this is also an AMM DEX,\nalthough it has some features that make it stand out. The exchange platform\noperates with multiple liquidity pools. Furthermore, its pools are more\nprofound than most other DEXs. This is why numerous DeFi applications use\nKyberSwap as their underlying protocol. The platform rewards each liquidity\nprovider with a 0.3% fee when a specific pair is traded. All rewards and\ntrading fees are paid in KNC, the exchange platform's native token.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Supports over 1,500 tokens\n\n  * Thousands of available swap pairs\n\n  * Liquidity providers receive a 0.3% fee\n\n  * Offers staking, farming, and DApp solutions\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * No fiat deposits\n\n  * No mobile app\n\n  * May be difficult for new traders to use\n\n###  **6\\. dYdX**\n\nUnlike most other DEXs, dYdX is an order book DEX. As such, it offers a more\ntraditional crypto market trading experience. However, it does still have some\nunique features. One is leveraged trading up to 5x the invested amount if\nusers go long or short on ETH. The platform also doubles as a _lending\nplatform_. It features cross-margin lending and borrowing. This lets users\nearn passively if they leave their funds on the platform. Assets that are\nactively used in trading can also generate interest. Also, dYdX's trading\nvolume is second only to Uniswap.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * User-friendly\n\n  * Second-highest trading volume among DEXs\n\n  * It has a mobile app\n\n  * The trading fee is only 0.1%\n\n  * Offers trading with leverage\n\n  * It lets you generate passive earnings in multiple ways\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * No fiat deposits\n\n  * Limited trading options\n\n###  **7\\. 1inch**\n\nThe seventh platform on the list is 1inch, which offers effortless crypto\ntrading. This is also the best DEX aggregator on the list. The platform scans\nmultiple DEXs before each transaction, allowing users to use the lowest prices\nwhen buying tokens. Its liquidity pool allows users to stake tokens and earn\nrewards in 1INCH token. By holding onto these native tokens, users also gain\nvoting rights.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * More than 400 tokens on offer\n\n  * Zero transaction fees\n\n  * 1INCH holders can participate in governance\n\n  * Excellent exchange rates\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Other DEXs might charge transaction fees\n\n  * May be difficult for new traders to use\n\n###  **8\\. Balancer**\n\nNext, we have another Ethereum-based DEX called Balancer. This is a platform\nthat executes quick trades by using smart contracts and liquidity pools. It's\nan AMM and provides users with several liquidity pools. Users can even build\ntheir own pools and select one of three types. These include smart pools,\nprivate pools, and shared pools.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Gas-free payments despite being on Ethereum\n\n  * Multiple pool types to choose from when creating your own pool\n\n  * Quick and easy to use\n\n  * It lets you generate passive earnings\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Transaction fees can vary depending on pool owners, going from 0.0001% to 10%\n\n###  **9\\. Bancor**\n\nNext up is Bancor \u2014 another credible DEX. Bancor was among the first AMMs to\nemerge on Ethereum back in 2017. The platform finalizes trades immediately\nwith automatic liquidity. This feature makes Bancor one of the best\ndecentralized exchanges for many traders. Apart from that, the platform's\nnative token, BNT, facilitates fast, effortless payments. The exchange\nprevents impermanent loss through staking, which is possible via multiple\npools. Both staking rewards and BNT contributions return excellent rewards.\nHowever, the best rewards come to those who simultaneously stake BNT and other\ncryptos.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * It's a trustworthy and established platform\n\n  * Protects users from impermanent loss\n\n  * Exchange fees vary but remain low\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * No fiat support\n\n  * Users must keep their assets in Bancor wallet\n\n###  **10\\. Slingshot**\n\nSlingshot is a popular Ethereum-based swapping protocol that features 0% fees.\nFounded in 2020, the platform can search for, send, receive, or swap crypto.\nThe platform is available on both mobile and desktop. It features multi-chain\nand bridging support for several networks. Those include Canto, Polygon,\nArbitrum, Binance BNB Chain, Arbitrum Nova, and Optimism.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Intuitive interface\n\n  * Advanced trading tools\n\n  * It lets you compare prices across multiple exchanges\n\n  * Stop loss and limit orders are available\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Needs verification\n\n  * You must meet a minimum deposit requirement to participate\n\n###  **11\\. CowSwap**\n\nThe eleventh DEX on the list is CowSwap, a DEX that facilitates the trade of\nEthereum-based tokens. It does this by matching supply and demand. It also\nprevents slippage and fees. However, orders that fail to find a Peer-to-Peer\nmatch are sent to the underlying AMM. CowSwap, therefore, allows users to\nexperience both approaches. Users get to execute trades with the best price\non-chain across all aggregators and exchanges.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Fully permissionless Meta DEX aggregator\n\n  * High security and privacy to protect trades\n\n  * Maximized liquidity\n\n  * Numerous token pairs\n\n  * Gas-less trading for off-chain order submissions\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Exploited in a hacking attack\n\n  * Still relatively new\n\n###  **12\\. IDEX**\n\nNext up, we have IDEX, which also runs on Ethereum's network. This is the\nperfect platform for active traders with high trading volume, as they can\ncomplete multiple trades simultaneously. Cancellations are also possible with\nno gas fees. Also, the platform features both market orders and limit orders.\nSecurity is also high due to advanced protection mechanisms. It's also worth\nnoting that IDEX uses CEXs and DEXs to support trades and improve security.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * It supports around 26 tokens\n\n  * Staking is available\n\n  * Gas-free cancellations of trades\n\n  * Minimal risk of security breaches\n\n  * Transaction fees are only 0.1%\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Complex interface\n\n  * No fiat support\n\n  * Users must confirm trades with private keys\n\n###  **13\\. DEX.AG**\n\nNext on the list is DEX.AG, which is an aggregator that gets liquidity from\nother DEXs. Some of them are even on this list. Combing these platforms before\nexecuting trades allows users to get some of the best prices. Not only that,\nbut users can save time and energy.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Zero fees\n\n  * Superior UI\n\n  * Saves time and energy\n\n  * Offers the best prices\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * You might have to pay fees from other DEXs\n\n###  **14\\. AirSwap**\n\nIn the next spot we have AirSwap, which operates on Ethereum, so users must\npay ETH gas fees. Other than that, there are no fees charged by the platform.\nThe exchange has its native token, AST, which can be swapped with any ERC-20\ntoken. Deposits and withdrawals are instant, so the user experience is\nexcellent.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Zero fees\n\n  * Minimal risk of security breaches\n\n  * Multiple tokens supported\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Peer-to-Peer trading is only completed when a suitable trader has been located\n\n###  **15\\. SushiSwap**\n\nSushiSwap is one of the best-known DEXs in the crypto industry. It evolved\nfrom Uniswap and deserves to be on the list of the best decentralized\nexchanges for several reasons. Its native token, SUSHI, allows users to\ngenerate passive earnings through staking. Various governance benefits are\ngained, and SushiSwap also has a unique DEX architecture that reduces the\ncentralization of the market.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Low transaction fees\n\n  * Works with most ERC-20 tokens\n\n  * Highly intuitive interface\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Complicated rewards structure\n\n  * Limited in cutting-edge technology\n\n###  **16\\. PancakeSwap**\n\nPancakeSwap is next on our list. This is the largest DEX on the Binance Smart\nChain, known for its very low-cost liquidity pools. The platform also features\nminimal risk of slippage. This non-custodial DEX offers automatic trading\nthanks to its liquidity pools. The pools run via smart contracts on the BSC.\nMeanwhile, the exchange's native token, CAKE, is used in staking, yield\nfarming, or governance.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * More than 50 supported DeFi tokens\n\n  * Low transaction fees\n\n  * Slippage risks are significantly reduced\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Possibility of impermanent loss\n\n###  **17 WX. Network**\n\nNext on the list is WX.Network. This DEX, formerly known as Waves, uses\ndigital assets such as BTC and LTC. The platform also offers an initial coin\noffering feature, which enables crowdfunding. Its interface has been designed\nto be easy to use and has a unique design. It can also reduce slippage by\ncombining centralized and decentralized functions.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Low risk of slippage\n\n  * It uses its own blockchain\n\n  * Extremely low trading fees (0.03%)\n\n  * Intuitive UI\n\n  * Multiple supported assets\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * No fiat support\n\n  * It is not regulated\n\n### 18\\. Xfai\n\nNext up is Xfai, a unique DEX that adopts an automated market maker model to\ncreate entangled liquidity pools. The DEX uses a system of on-chain constant\nfunction market maker (CFMM) smart contracts, rather than the token-pair-based\nconstant product market maker approach. This aims to address the challenges of\nliquidity fragmentation (where liquidity is fragmented across different\nplatforms, making price discovery difficult) and high slippage. Hosted on both\nthe Ethereum and Linea chain, Xfai also offers 'Infinity Staking' to users \u2014 a\nunique form of liquidity provisioning.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Custom built to avoid liquidity fragmentation and minimize slippage\n\n  * Allows users to trade any digital asset\n\n  * Simple dashboard for managing all assets in one place\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Risk of impermanent loss from AMMs\n\n  * Relatively high swap fee of 0.4%\n\n### 19\\. ParaSwap\n\nFinally, ParaSwap is a popular multi-chain DeFi aggregator that aims to give\ntraders and DApps access to the best prices, high liquidity, and fast\ntransactions. ParaSwap achieves this by curating the liquidity of DEXs and\nlending protocols into a single and secure interface and API for intuitive\nusability. The platform combines a yield optimizer, independent smart contract\naudits, and advanced charts with its API functionality to help users find the\nmost favorable prices with little effort.\n\n **Pros:**\n\n  * Aggregator functionality presents users with the best prices\n\n  * Simple access to fragmented liquidity pools\n\n  * High liquidity\n\n **Cons:**\n\n  * Unable to purchase cryptocurrencies directly\n\n  * Cannot use fiat currency to make trades\n\n## Should you trade cryptocurrency on DEXs?\n\nDEXs have grown to be a massive part of the crypto trading scene. Thanks to\ntheir non-custodial nature, your funds are never put in danger during trading.\nThe trades are instant, and everything is done through smart contracts. With\nthat being said, even the best decentralized exchanges have their downsides.\nThis is why it's essential to research any platform before you begin to use\nit.\n\nGet started\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Which is the best decentralized exchange?\n\nEach DEX has its pros and cons, so none can be described as the best.
