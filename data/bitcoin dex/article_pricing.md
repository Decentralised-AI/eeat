I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to current data, including the latest pricing plans or features of specific Bitcoin decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Additionally, without specific names of Bitcoin DEXs and their corresponding pricing plans or features, I cannot create a comparison review.

However, I can guide you on how to create a comparison review once you have the necessary data. Here's a template you can use to compare Bitcoin DEXs once you've gathered the relevant information:

## Summary

In conclusion, each Bitcoin DEX has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. DEX 1 may offer lower fees but might lack in liquidity compared to DEX 2. DEX 3 might have the highest number of trading pairs but could have a more complex user interface. Users should consider their own trading habits, security preferences, and the importance of features such as anonymity and customer support when choosing a DEX.

Remember to conduct your own due diligence and consider the latest updates from each platform before making a decision.
