One too many exchanges went\ndown due to an external or internal hack, with attackers making it off with a\nsignificant portion of exchange funds.\n\n## #What is Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?\n\nA decentralized exchange (DEX) is an online peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency\nexchange service which operates without central authority responsible for the\nasset storage and swapping. This service allows quick and easy cryptocurrency\ntransactions between two interested parties without unnecessary movement of\ncrypto funds with attached fees and complete anonymity.\n\nThe benefits of decentralized exchange of cryptocurrencies are numerous -\n\n  *  **Security:** Users don't have to deposit their funds to the crypto exchange wallets, removing the risks of theft, and attached network fees.\n  *  **No price manipulation:** It is impossible to manipulate crypto asset prices since supply is always tied to the demand and backed by the pair of cryptocurrencies.\n  *  **No fake volumes:** It is impossible to counterfeit trading volumes with wash trading since all transaction information is on the public ledger. Besides, there is simply no central authority that would be interested in faking the trading volumes.\n  *  **Independence from regulations:** Since it's a peer-to-peer service, there is no need for identity checks (KYC), and any local authorities do not bound the decentralized exchange. The consent and responsibility to commence trading between two individuals are theirs alone.\n  *  **Accessibility for new crypto assets:** Sometimes, it takes ages and enormous fees for a typical cryptocurrency exchange to list a new crypto trading pair. The decentralized exchange is an open market, making it possible to trade existing cryptocurrencies or adding new crypto assets on the fly directly in the platform.\n\n## #What is OpenDEX?\n\nOpen-Source Decentralized Crypto Exchange (OpenDEX) is an inventive solution\nto deploy a cost-effective Uniswap-based cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) in\nrecord time.\n\nThe decentralized exchange platform developed by Openware is flexible, fast,\nand scales well.
