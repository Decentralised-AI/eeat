However, did you know that there\u2019s two types of exchanges?\nCentralized ones, where you are not in full control of your own crypto, or\nDecentralized ones also known as a DEX. Today, we\u2019re taking a closer look into\nwhat a DEX is and what it brings to the table._\n\nLooking to start your journey into the wondrous world of cryptocurrencies?\nMost likely, you\u2019ll find yourself using a crypto exchange to get your very\nfirst Bitcoin or other crypto of your choosing. After this, that crypto\nexchange can still be pretty useful to you, since you can trade one digital\nasset for another there. For example, you could swap your Ethereum for XRP if\nyou want.\n\nHowever, did you know that the crypto you keep on an exchange is actually not\nin your control?\n\nYou cannot do what you want with your own crypto. The exchange holds a vital\npiece of data: your Private Key. Remember the famous crypto saying _Not your\nkey, not your coins_? Since the exchange holds your key, they own your crypto\nand have control over them.\n\nNow, imagine if there are security issues on the exchange\u2019s platform. We\u2019ve\nseen several of them being hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars over the\nyears. Part of the reason is that these exchanges are _centralized_ : there\u2019s\na single place where their huge crypto wealth is stored \u2013 a great target for\nhackers.\n\nThat\u2019s where Decentralized Exchanges come in.\n\n## What Is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?\n\nA decentralized exchange \u2013 or DEX in short is an exchange where YOU hold your\nkeys. Remember that _Private Key_ we mentioned earlier? With a DEX, you\nactually hold the Private Key. This means you remain in total control of your\nown crypto, and you decide how its security is handled. Also that single point\nof failure we mentioned for normal exchanges? A DEX doesn\u2019t have that:\neveryone keeps their own keys, so the wealth is completely dispersed. It is\n_decentralized_. That said, a DEX doesn\u2019t offer the same services. Let\u2019s dive\ndeeper into it.\n\n## What Is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) For?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most important part: How can you hold your Private Key,\nbut still trade your cryptocurrencies for another? Well, with centralized\ncrypto exchanges, you used to have to make an account to log in and use their\nservices. With a DEX, your Private Key counts as your login. Once you log into\nthe DEX with your Private Key, you\u2019ll immediately see your crypto balances.\nYou won\u2019t have to provide any personal information \u2013 great for those who value\ntheir privacy!\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that a DEX doesn\u2019t come with its own challenges. Let\u2019s go\nover the pros and cons of using a Decentralized Exchange.\n\n## Benefits of Decentralized Exchanges\n\nYou\u2019re probably aware that traditional crypto exchanges handle the swap of one\ndigital currency for another for you. So how\u2019s this different for a DEX?\n\nThey actually don\u2019t handle the exchange itself: it\u2019s purely peer-to-peer. This\nmeans that the platform is basically there to help you trade your crypto with\nsomeone else directly, rather than getting involved in it. Ok, sounds great,\nbut what does this mean for you? Two advantages: 1. You don\u2019t need to trust\n_anyone_ for the trade to take place. 2. The fees paid for the trade are\nusually lower than with normal exchanges.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s talk security. A DEX is decentralized, meaning each individual\nperson keeps their own crypto secure. You don\u2019t have to entrust the security\nof your crypto to someone else \u2013 you\u2019re completely in control of it.\n\n_This is a blessing\u2026 but can also be a curse if you don\u2019t take this\nresponsibility seriously._\n\n## Risks of Decentralized Exchanges\n\nReading this article, you might be thinking that you prefer to start your\ncrypto journey through a DEX, right? Well\u2026 that\u2019s not going to happen\nunfortunately. A DEX is an amazing tool for trading. On the other hand, it\ndoesn\u2019t allow you to buy your crypto currencies there though. There might be a\nfeature to buy crypto on their page, but it\u2019ll be an outside service: it\u2019s not\nactually within the DEX platform itself. Decentralized exchanges only provide\nthe option to trade your crypto assets, not to purchase some with Euros or US\nDollars.\n\nBeing in charge of the security of your private keys can be an amazing thing,\nbut it also means you are completely responsible for it. A problem when using\na DEX is that most methods require you to enter your private keys on a\ncomputer or smartphone. This makes them vulnerable to online attacks.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to first get a good grasp of how you can secure your private keys.\nThe best and easiest way to secure your private keys is with hardware wallets,\nlike the ones we create. We recommend everyone wanting to use a DEX to read\nthis article showing the different ways you can secure your private keys.\n\nLastly, a decentralized exchange is pretty different to use from usual\nexchanges. It\u2019s not as simple as logging in and clicking just two buttons to\ntrade your Bitcoin for Ethereum. Use-cases for a DEX are often a bit limited:\ndue to its complexity, it\u2019s more for advanced users. Also the assets you can\ntrade on a DEX are usually somewhat limited. That said, it can be used to help\ndiversify your crypto portfolio while maintaining ownership and privacy.\n\n## Stay Secure: Access DEXs With Your Ledger\n\nSo the best and easiest way to secure your Private Keys is using a hardware\nwallet. Why? The answer is pretty simple: your computer or smartphone is\nconnected to the internet. This can look completely harmless, though the\nopposite couldn\u2019t be more true. Someone can use this to hack your computer or\nsmartphone and gain access to all the data that\u2019s on it, including your\nprivate keys. If they get access to this, they can steal all of your crypto\nassets.\n\nHardware wallets make sure that your private keys never end up on your PC or\nphone. It remains completely offline, out of reach from hackers.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering to yourself: can Ledger devices be used with\ndecentralized exchanges? Well good news: Yes, Ledger hardware wallets can be\nused with multiple DEXs! Back in the beginning of 2019, our devices became the\nfirst hardware wallet that can be used with the famous Binance DEX. The list\nof DEXes that the Ledger Nano X and Ledger Nano S can connect to is endless:\nIDEX, Waves Platform and many more!\n\n_Keep learning!
