You can\nimagine a CEX to be similar to a stock exchange but for digital assets.\n\nPopular Crypto Exchanges are Binance, Coinbase Exchange, Kraken and KuCoin.\nMuch like stock trading websites or apps, these exchanges allow cryptocurrency\ninvestors to buy and sell digital assets at the prevailing price, called spot,\nor to leave orders that get executed when the asset gets to the investor\u2019s\ndesired price target, called limit orders.\n\nCEXs operate using an order book system, which means that buy and sell orders\nare listed and sorted by the intended buy or sell price. The matching engine\nof the exchange then matches buyers and sellers based on the best executable\nprice given the desired lot size. Hence, a digital asset\u2019s price will depend\non the supply and demand of that asset versus another, whether it be fiat\ncurrency or cryptocurrency.\n\nCEXs decide which digital asset it will allow trading in, which provides a\nsmall measure of comfort that unscrupulous digital assets may be excluded from\nthe CEX.\n\nDecentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (\u201cDEX\u201d)\n\nA decentralized exchange is another type of exchange that allows peer-to-peer\ntransactions directly from your digital wallet without going through an\nintermediary. Examples of DEXs include Uniswap, PancakeSwap, dYdX, and Kyber.\n\nThese decentralized exchanges rely on smart contracts, self-executing pieces\nof code on a blockchain. These smart contracts allow for more privacy and less\nslippage (another term for transaction costs) than a centralized\ncryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOn the other hand, even though smart contracts are rules-based, the lack of an\nintermediary third party means that the user is left to their own, so DEXs are\nmeant for sophisticated investors.\n\n### Advantages of Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\n#### 1\\. User-friendly\n\nCentralized exchanges offer beginner investors a familiar, friendly way of\ntrading and investing in cryptocurrencies. As opposed to using crypto wallets\nand peer-to-peer transactions, which can be complex, users of centralized\nexchanges can log into their accounts, view their account balances, and make\ntransactions through applications and websites.\n\n#### 2\\. Reliable\n\nCentralized exchanges offer an extra layer of security and reliability when it\ncomes to transactions and trading. By facilitating the transaction through a\ndeveloped, centralized platform, centralized exchanges offer higher levels of\ncomfort.\n\n#### 3\\. Leverage\n\nOne of the other benefits of certain CEXs is the option to leverage your\ninvestments using borrowed money from the exchange, called margin trading. It\nallows investors to reap higher returns, but losses can also be amplified.\n\n### Disadvantages of Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\n#### 1\\. Hacking risk\n\nCentralized exchanges are operated by companies that are responsible for the\nholdings of their customers. Large exchanges usually hold billions of dollars\nworth of bitcoin, making them a target for hackers and theft.\n\nAn example of such an incident is Mt.Gox, which was once the world\u2019s largest\ncryptocurrency exchange company before it reported the theft of 850,000\nbitcoins, leading to its collapse.\n\n#### 2\\. Transaction fees\n\nUnlike peer-to-peer transactions, centralized exchanges often charge high\ntransaction fees for their services and convenience, which can be especially\nhigh when trading in large amounts.\n\n#### 3\\. Custody of digital assets and risk of fraud\n\nLastly and most importantly, most CEXs will hold your digital asset as a\ncustodian in their own digital wallet rather than allow you to store your\nprivate keys on your own digital wallet. While more convenient when you want\nto trade, there are drawbacks, namely the risk of the centralized\ncryptocurrency exchange failing and fraud.\n\nRecent examples include the failure of the 50 USD billion algorithmic\nstablecoin TerraUSD and sister token Luna, the bankruptcies of hedge fund\nThree Arrows Capital, lender Celsius Network, broker Voyager Digital and the\nsudden collapse of FTX and Alameda Research.\n\n### Advantages of Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\n#### 1\\. Custody\n\nUsers of decentralized exchanges do not need to transfer their assets to a\nthird party. Therefore, there is no risk of a company or organization being\nhacked, and users are assured of greater safety from hacking, failure, fraud,\nor theft.\n\n#### 2\\. Preventing market manipulation\n\nDue to their nature of allowing for the peer-to-peer exchange of\ncryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges prevent market manipulation,\nprotecting users from fake trading and wash trading.\n\n#### 3\\. Less censorship\n\nDecentralized exchanges do not require customers to fill out know-your-\ncustomer (KYC) forms, offering privacy and anonymity to users. Since DEXs\ndon\u2019t exercise censorship, more cryptocurrencies and digital assets are\navailable than through a CEX. As a matter of fact, many Altcoins are only\navailable on DEXs.\n\n### Disadvantages of Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\n#### 1\\. Complexity\n\nUsers of decentralized exchanges must remember the keys and passwords to their\ncrypto wallets, or their assets are lost forever and cannot be recovered. They\nrequire the user to learn and get familiar with the platform and the process,\nunlike centralized exchanges, which offer a more convenient and user-friendly\nprocess.\n\n#### 2\\. Lack of fiat payments\n\nDEXs are best for investors looking to switch from one digital asset to\nanother and not well suited for someone looking to buy or sell digital assets\nwith fiat currency, called on and off-ramping. It makes them less convenient\nfor users that do not already hold cryptocurrencies.\n\n#### 3\\. Liquidity struggles\n\nSome 99% of crypto transactions are facilitated by centralized exchanges,\nwhich suggests that they are accountable for the majority of the trading\nvolume. Due to the lack of volume, decentralized exchanges often lack\nliquidity, and it can be difficult to find buyers and sellers when trading\nvolumes are low.\n\n### The 10 Top Cryptocurrency Exchanges, Ranked by Volume (as of Nov. 2022)\n\n#### Top Centralized Exchanges[1]\n\nThe following are the top centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, according to\ntraffic, liquidity, and trading volumes.\n\n  1.
