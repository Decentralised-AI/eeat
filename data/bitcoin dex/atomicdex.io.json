Although many network\nusers see fees as undesirable, they are essential to the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n##  Why Do Blockchain Transaction Fees Exist?\n\nTransaction fees perform two main functions on blockchain networks. Firstly,\nthey make large-scale spam attacks on blockchain networks almost impossible,\nas doing this will cost money. The incurred fee reduces the number of\npotential malicious actors because people are less likely to spam if it comes\nat a cost.\n\nSecondly, blockchain fees incentivize miners and validators who process\ntransactions. The role of miners is to validate crypto transactions and add\nthem to the blockchain. These miners use powerful computers that make up a\nportion of the network to confirm and validate all blockchain transactions.\nMiners then receive rewards for the large amounts of computing power and\nenergy they use to validate transactions. For every block (a collection of\ntransactions) they add to the blockchain, miners get payment from transaction\nfees.\n\nIt is worth noting that miners have a financial incentive to prioritize\ntransactions with higher fees. This is because the average miner will not\nspend more computing power than it is worth to process a transaction with low\nfees.\n\n##  How Do Cryptocurrency Transaction Fees Work?\n\nFees depend mainly on the transaction's size and the blockchain network's\noverall throughput. Generally, the more complex the transaction, the higher\nthe transaction fee. When a blockchain is heavily congested, users can opt to\nadd a higher fee so that miners will prioritize their transactions. Naturally,\nminers will quickly process transactions with the highest fees over others.\nThis creates a bidding war for network users who want to have their\ntransactions validated and subsequently pushes the fee price up.\n\nHowever, unlike traditional payment methods, the fees paid for a crypto\ntransaction depend not only on the amount sent but also on two other factors:\n\n  * The complexity of the transaction\n  * How many people are using the blockchain network at the time of the transaction\n\n##  Crypto Transaction Fees Comparison\n\nCalculating fees paid for crypto transactions is quite straightforward. The\namount paid per transaction varies between exchanges and may depend on the\namount of crypto sent. The blockchain network used also plays a vital role in\ndetermining transaction fees.\n\n###  Bitcoin Transactions Fees\n\nAs the first blockchain network, Bitcoin inadvertently set the standard for\ntransaction fees for all other cryptocurrencies. Unlike some other cryptos,\nBitcoin (BTC) fees don't depend on the amount sent, but on the transaction\nsize (in bytes). Complicated transactions with more inputs and outputs involve\nmore data and are therefore more expensive.\n\nBTC traders and miners measure their fees in 'Satoshis', the smallest\ndivisible unit of Bitcoin, equal to 100 millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001\nBTC). The measuring unit for BTC transaction fees is sats/vByte, which means\nsatoshi per unit of data used in the transaction. If a transaction consumes\n400 bytes, and the average transaction fee is 80 satoshis per byte, the user\nwould pay 32,000 satoshis (or 0.00032 BTC) to have their transaction validated\nand added to the next block. _ ****_\n\n###  Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\n'Gas' is the internal monetary unit of the system used to conduct a\ntransaction suh as sending ERC-20 tokens or interacting with decentralized\napplications on the Ethereum network. While the amount of gas required for a\ntransaction does not usually change, gas prices can fluctuate. Regardless, the\nprice relies mainly on the congestion of the Ethereum network. Similar to\nBitcoin miners, users who pay higher gas prices are prioritized for\ntransaction validation.\n\n##  How To Minimize Crypto Transaction Fees\n\nUnderstanding the transaction fees for crypto trades helps to predict and plan\nexpenditures. Users who understand these charges can accurately estimate the\ntransaction's fee and minimize costs. In addition to knowledge of transaction\nfees, here are a few other ways that users can reduce charges:\n\n **Check Average Blockchain Fee:** If the transaction is not time-sensitive,\nthe trader can wait until the average fee amount drops.\n\n **Opt For Decentralized Exchanges:** Decentralized exchanges like AtomicDEX\ncut out any intermediaries, allowing for peer-to-peer crypto transactions and\nlower platform fees.\n\n **Hold Coins That Offer a Trading Discount:** Some exchanges offer discounts\nto holders of their native tokens. For example, AtomicDEX offers holders of\nKMD (KMD) a 10% discount on trades involving KMD and another cryptocurrency.\n\n##  Congestion on the Network\n\nTransaction fees are integral to blockchain networks, as they incentivize\nminers to secure the network and keep it running. However, because of network\ncongestion caused by a rising number of crypto users, these fees can sometimes\nspike. If there are a large number of users trying to validate transactions at\nthe same time, each person will likely pay high transaction fees regardless of\nthe actual transaction amount.\n\n##  Try AtomicDEX \u2014 Hold and Trade Cryptocurrencies\n\nAtomicDEX is a non-custodial wallet, cross-chain/protocol bridge, and cross-\nchain/protocol DEX rolled into one app that supports 99% of cryptocurrencies.\n\nMany trading pairs offer very low transaction fees, even for trading\ncryptocurrencies across two different blockchain networks. Try AtomicDEX\nwallet to hold and trade cryptocurrencies such as Avalanche (AVAX), Zcash\n(ZEC), Ravencoin (RVN), and much more all from one app.\n\nDownload AtomicDEX\n\nPlay Video\n\n## Komodian Knight\n\nCrypto Essentials\n\n## Get More Updates\n\nSubscribe to the Komodo Wallet newsletter to get the latest project news on\nreleases, partnerships, and events sent to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Thank you!\n\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\n\nRead Our Cryptocurrency Blog - Blockchain News, Crypto News, User Guides,\nAnnouncements, & More\n\n### Related articles\n\nSee all articles\n\n12 May 2023\n\n### How to Buy Land in the Metaverse\n\nMetaverse land: a new frontier for investors.
