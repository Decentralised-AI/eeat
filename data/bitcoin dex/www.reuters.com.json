Decentralized exchanges, that is.\n\nThe spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, a major centralized\ncrypto exchange, has unleashed a wave of calls for more regulation from\nmainstream bankers and investors.\n\nBy contrast, some crypto players are channeling bitcoin creator Satoshi\nNakamoto's original crypto vision by cutting out the financial middleman and\ntaking to decentralized exchanges, where investors trade peer-to-peer on the\nblockchain.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nOn Nov. 10, as FTX imploded, overall daily trading volumes on DEXs including\nthe likes of Uniswap leapt as high as $12 billion, their highest level since\nMay, according to data from market tracker DeFi Llama, though they have since\npared gains.\n\nFour days later, November volumes had surpassed the whole of the month before,\naccording to CryptoCompare.\n\nMeanwhile, weekly bitcoin flows from centralized exchanges, or CEXs, recorded\ntheir largest-ever net outflow, with 97,805 coin moved off platforms in the\nseven days to Nov. 13, CryptoCompare data shows.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\n\"It is now clear that there can be risk associated with holding assets in a\ncentralized entity,\" said Varun Kumar, CEO of decentralized crypto exchange\nHashflow. \"Data is showing that users are turning to decentralized trading\nsolutions.\"\n\nNonetheless, DEXs are not necessarily safer than their centralized rivals,\nwith inexperienced investors potentially exposed to huge risks.\n\nUsers trade tokens directly with each other using blockchain-based smart\ncontracts instead of passing funds through an intermediary or central\nauthority.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nThus, as with other platforms in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) or\nWeb3, there is no central oversight and - for good or for ill - investors are\nresponsible for their trades, settlements and safe-keeping of coins or tokens.\n\nBy comparison CEXs, such as Coinbase (COIN.O), Binance and FTX, are more akin\nto traditional exchanges on Wall Street, acting as the middleman in\ntransactions, thus making trading more user-friendly especially for new\ninvestors, and sometimes offering coin custody services, as FTX did.\n\nMany centralized players have also been pushing to boost user confidence with\nmeasures to increase transparency, such as demonstrating proof of their\nreserves.\n\nCoinbase, Binance and FTX didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\n## FTX SHENANIGANS\n\nThat said, advocates of decentralization say DEXs could offer investors some\nprotection from the kind of shenanigans that appear to have gone on at FTX,\nwhere as much as $1 billion of customer funds are reported missing.\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrencies plunge into water in this illustration\ntaken, May 23, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Acquire\nLicensing Rights\n\nDEXs cannot halt withdrawals, they require users to retain custody of their\nfunds, and trading activity and reserves can be traced directly on the\nblockchain.\n\n\"There are definitely elements of DEXs appealing to people as they mitigate\nthe chances of some nefarious operator or a single point of failure in the\nsystem,\" said David Wells, CEO at crypto exchange Enclave Markets, which\noffers elements of both centralized and decentralized services.\n\nThe FTX crash certainly pumped up trading volumes on decentralized exchanges\nat the time.\n\nVolumes at the largest DEX, Uniswap, spiked to $17.2 billion in the week of\nNov. 6-13, from just over $6 billion the week before, while other smaller\ndecentralized exchanges also reported higher volumes.\n\nGMX saw over $6 billion in the week after Nov. 6, when FTX's troubles came to\nlight, three times recent its weekly averages. Hashflow saw $110 million on\nNov. 9, the day Binance dropped a plan to bail out FTX, versus a daily average\nof $25 million.\n\nDespite the recent surge, crypto isn't migrating en masse to DeFi exchanges,\nand daily DEX volumes have fallen back near October levels of below $3\nbillion.\n\nNonetheless, there has been a broader, more subtle shift to decentralized\nexchanges, with data from Chainalysis showing overall monthly trading volumes\non DEXs were between $181.5 billion and $240.3 billion from August through\nOctober, compared with a range of $173 billion to $203.5 billion for CEXs.\n\n## LOWER TRADE SPEEDS\n\nThe renewed interest in DEXs ties into the debate at the heart of crypto since\nSatoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper 14 years ago: the role, if any, that\ncentralization and regulation should play in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhile some investors prefer the transparency of decentralized exchanges, the\nplatforms aren't suitable for investors such as traditional financial\ninstitutions and specialized trading firms, said Wells at Enclave Markets.\n\nFor example, DEXs typically have slower transaction speeds, while hedge funds\nmight not want their trading strategies to be publicly traceable on the\nblockchain.\n\nMany traditional finance institutions are also legally required to hold\nexternal funds with an external custodian and would not be able to \"self-\ncustody\" investors' assets to trade them on decentralized exchanges.\n\nSo is the future DEX or CEX?\n\nMany market participants see both centralized and decentralized exchanges\ncoexisting.\n\n\"The interconnectedness is critical,\" said Chris Kline, co-founder of Bitcoin\nIRA, which offers cryptocurrency retirement accounts, referring to DEXs and\nCEXs growing together as crypto trading expands.\n\n\"Both will exist in the future.\"\n\nReporting by Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by\nVidya Ranganathan and Pravin Char\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nAcquire Licensing Rights, opens new tab\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * article with video\n\nFuture of MoneycategoryCryptoverse: Bitcoin miners get stuck in a bear pit\n\nSpare a thought for the beleaguered bitcoin miner.\n\n  * article with video\n\nFuture of MoneycategoryCryptoverse: Ether snaps at bitcoin's heels in race for\ncrypto crown\n\nFor years, ether could barely dream of challenging its big brother bitcoin.\nNow, its ambitions may be becoming more realistic.\n\n  * article with gallery\n\nFuture of MoneycategoryCryptoverse: Blockchain bridges fall into troubled\nwaters\n\nAnother day, another hack - and another blockchain bridge burned.\n\n  * article with gallery\n\nFuture of MoneycategoryCryptoverse: What crisis?
