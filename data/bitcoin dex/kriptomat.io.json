Both publications have begun covering decentralized\ncryptocurrency exchanges, or DEXs, the attention-getting services that promise\nto give users and investors more control over their crypto funds.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the media. Researchers at Messari report that DEXs handled $122\nbillion in transactions during crypto\u2019s record-breaking April 2021 bull market\n\u2013 compared to just $1 billion in April 2020.\n\nAnalysts at DEX Metrics report that as of July 2021, decentralized exchanges\nlike Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Binance DEX are handling about $15 billion in\ntransactions each week. That\u2019s less than 10% of overall crypto transaction\nvolume, but the technology\u2019s rapid growth and market acceptance are\nimpressive. It\u2019s no wonder people are talking.\n\n## Dex and Crypto: Why All the Fuss?\n\nDecentralization is one of the core values of the crypto movement. Crypto\ntransactions are conducted freely without the approval, regulatory oversight,\nor high fees of banks and other financial institutions. That\u2019s one of the\nbenefits of using and investing in cryptocurrencies. Every DEX crypto is\nintended to bring the benefits of decentralization to crypto buying, selling,\nand portfolio management.\n\nDEX enthusiasts argue that centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and\nKriptomat bring many of the features of traditional banks into the crypto\nworld. They envision a future in which users rely on smart contracts to\nconduct business with each other on the blockchain, with no centralized\nexchange to compromise user anonymity, impose fees, hold funds, regulate\ntransactions, decide which coins and tokens to support, or attract hackers.\n\nOthers worry that those who leave traditional exchanges behind are throwing\nout the baby with the bathwater. Centralized exchanges provide essential\nservices: user education, customer support, trading-partner validation, lower\nfees, security, managed liquidity pools, coin background info, price\nhistories, and much more. Reputable exchanges comply with consumer safeguards,\nincluding laws, financial regulations, and licensing requirements in the\ncountries where they do business. These features are not part of the DEX\nworld. Even the best decentralized exchange can\u2019t match the support and ease\nof use found at conventional platforms like Kriptomat.\n\nWhat is a decentralized exchange? Wall Street Journal financial reporter\nAlexander Osipovich may have said it best in a May 2021 article. Osipovich\nsaid decentralized exchanges \u201clook less like the New York Stock Exchange and\nmore like Napster, the defunct music-sharing service.\u201d\n\n##  \nHow Does a Decentralized Crypto Exchange Work?\n\nAt a conventional cryptocurrency exchange, you start by creating an account\nand satisfying the site\u2019s Know Your Customer conditions. After you have\ndeposited funds or connected your existing crypto wallet, you can buy, sell,\nand trade cryptocurrencies, making a quick transaction or building a long-term\nportfolio.\n\nAt a decentralized crypto exchange, you connect your cryptocurrency wallet to\nsoftware running on the DEX website. If you wish to purchase or swap crypto\nassets, you simply specify what you are looking for. The decentralized\nexchange app tells you the price, and if you approve, you okay the\ntransaction. You never log in, provide a name or email address, or create an\naccount.\n\nDEX crypto exchanges don\u2019t match you up with an individual seller. Instead,\nthey employ automated market makers, or AMMs, to offer you coins and tokens\nfrom a liquidity pool: a quantity of cryptocurrency that other users have made\navailable for a specified period. When you buy crypto at a decentralized\nexchange, you buy from a liquidity pool.\n\nThe AMM approach means you can join liquidity pools by lending funds to them.\nYou can make your crypto funds available for a week, a month, or another\nspecified period. At the end of the period, you get your funds back plus a\nportion of the transaction fees generated by the liquidity pool. It\u2019s like\nbuying a government bond.\n\nSophisticated DEXs give you lots of control over how you participate in a\nliquidity pool. For example, you might make tokens available only within a\nspecific price range. Sophisticated traders tweak these options to boost their\nprofits.\n\nImage source: QuoteInspector.com, License: CC BY-ND 4.0\n\n  \nThat\u2019s DEXs in a nutshell. They are essentially matchmaking services that link\ncrypto buyers with pools of crypto funds that are available for purchase.\n\n## What Is a DEX \u2013 And Do You Need One?\n\nDEXs are a step in the evolution of a worldwide digital economy. In the long\nrun, their weaknesses will be addressed and their benefits will be matched by\ntraditional exchanges. Hybrid exchanges are already emerging, platforms that\naim to offer the best of both worlds.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis text is informative in nature and should not be considered an investment\nrecommendation.
