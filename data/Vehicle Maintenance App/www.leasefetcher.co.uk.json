These views are fully our own._\n\n## 5 best car maintenance apps for iPhone\n\nIf you\u2019ve got an iPhone in your back pocket, you\u2019re locked into the App Store\necosystem. The good news is that there\u2019s a bunch of outstanding apps on offer,\nalthough many of them are paid.\n\nHere are the best 5 apps we\u2019ve tested in the office. (I\u2019ve ordered them by\ntheir App Store review rating.)\n\n### Fuelly 4.7/5\n\nFuelly started off as a simple fuel efficiency tracker but steadily developed\ninto a multifunctional app. Right now, Fuelly can help you track and monitor\nyour fuel efficiency and record your service history. It also supports custom\nreminders for things like tyre rotations, oil changes, interim/full services\nand so on.\n\nIf you often forget how often you should wash your car, or how often your car\nneeds waxed, Fuelly can ping you with a notification.You even have the option\nto store photos and PDFs, and create Excel compatible email reports.\n\nThe main downside is that you can\u2019t enter litres when using MPG, which makes\nit trickier for UK users.\n\nHowever, it does boast almost 800 strong reviews, and you can get the basic\nversion for free!\n\n  * Download\n\n###  \n\n### Vehicle Maintenance Tracker (VMT) (4.7/5)\n\nA great option if you want to track all previous and upcoming maintenance, VMT\nallows you to add maintenance items and updates like oil changes, tire change,\nbattery and brakes.\n\nIf you often find yourself dreading how much maintenance check ups are going\nto hurt your wallet, VMT can help. You can stay on top of your car maintenance\ncosts by attaching receipts to your maintenance items. If you know something\nneeds replaced or repaired again, just head to the app and check how much you\npaid last time.\n\n  * Download\n\n### KnowYourCar (4.5/5)\n\nAn excellent companion app for any new or current drivers, KnowYourCar does\njust about everything. If you\u2019re lost on the types of car services, or even\nhow often you should service your car, KnowYourCar does the work for you.\n\nYou can get reminders when a service or replacement is due, and\nrecommendations on the best garages near you. By simply typing in your\nregistration, get information about your car like the recommended tyre\npressure, the correct oil to use, and the right battery.\n\nEverything you ever needed to know about your car like MOT, tax and insurance\nstatus - all in one handy app!\n\n  * Download\n\n\n\n### Simply Auto (4.4 /5 )\n\nOffering much of the same services as its competitors, Simply Auto assists you\nwith fuel management, tracking your maintenance and general car expenses.\n\nOne of the most straightforward to use, the app offers easy to view stats and\ngraphs for you to check on your expenses like fuel cost per month, and service\ncost per kilometre.\n\nWhere this app excels above others is if you have a company car or business\ncar lease. If you\u2019ve had one before, you likely know the struggle of trying to\nremember the mileage on trips you\u2019ve already completed.\n\nWith Simply Auto, a GPS tracker does it all for you. Recording your tax\ndeductible and reimbursable mileage, Simply Auto stores your business and\npersonal trips all on the app.\n\n  * Download\n\n\n\n### AutoCare (3.3 / 5)\n\nAutoCare is a colourful little app that records your fuel and service records,\nand generates a maintenance schedule. Everything in the app is super simple\nand intuitive to use and I had no problem adding, editing and removing\nmaintenance events for several cars.\n\nIt supports multiple vehicles, which is really handy if you\u2019ve got a couple of\ncars in your household. Plus, it syncs with iCloud too, which is great for\npeople concerned with back-ups.\n\nThough AutoCare falls short on the rating, it is one of the cheapest paid-for\napps on the list at only \u00a32.99.\n\n## 5 best car maintenance apps for Android\n\nIf you\u2019re more of an Android fan and have a Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel or\nother Android-powered phone in your pocket, there\u2019s a bunch of great apps\navailable through Google Play.\n\nHere are the best 5 apps we\u2019ve tested in the office. (I\u2019ve ordered them by\nGoogle Play review rating.)\n\n### Drivvo (4.7 / 5)\n\nDrivvo is a brilliant app for both iPhone and Android that brings all your\nmotoring expense tracking into one place. From tracking regular car\nmaintenance to calculating your real-world fuel efficiency, Drivvo is a one-\nstop shop for all things automotive.\n\nYou start off by entering a few details about your car \u2014 make, model, license\nplate, fuel type, VIN number, etc \u2014 and then you\u2019re good to go.\n\nTo get the most out of Drivvo, you\u2019ve really got to commit and log every\nexpense related to your car. Every time you fill up your car, you log in.\nEvery time you get something repaired, you log it. Every time you go in for a\nservice, you log it.\n\nIf you\u2019re diligent, you get a bunch of great data like average fuel efficiency\nand average repair costs.\n\nThere\u2019s a free and paid version of the app. The free version is plenty\npowerful and is good enough for the vast majority of motorists. The paid\nversion rips out the ads, supports cloud backups, cross-device synchronisation\nand improved support.\n\n  * Download\n\n### DIY Car Maintenance (4.7 / 5)\n\nThis app is unlike a lot of the others on the list. While most of the other\napps are for logging and tracking, DIY Car Maintenance is all about education.\n\nIt offers super simple step-by-step instructions for a bunch of simple car\nmaintenance tasks. If you\u2019re a fan of some DIY maintenance, even if just a\npre-MOT check, this is the app for you.\n\nWhether it\u2019s changing the oil, replacing a tyre, checking engine fluids or\nswapping out the cabin filter, this app has you covered.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s free which is nice.\n\n  * Download\n\n### Car Problems & Repairs (4.2 / 5)\n\nThis is a free app and you should try and remember that when you\u2019re fighting\npast all the adverts. Yes, the ads are annoying but there is a brilliant app\nbehind them.\n\nCar Problems & Repairs is essentially a diagnostic app you can use to help\nwork out what\u2019s going on with your car.\n\nEverything is segmented by manufacturer and broken up into problem categories\nlike Transmission, Engine Cooling and Battery. Just find the section you\u2019re\nlooking for and scroll through until you find the symptoms to match your car.\n\n  * Download\n\n### Car Maintenance Reminder Lite (3.9 / 5)\n\nCar Maintenance Reminder Lite (catchy name, I know) is a solid little app for\nrecording maintenance and repairs.\n\nSince it\u2019s built around automated reminders, all you need to do is log your\nservices and the app will automatically send you updates when it\u2019s time to\nbook another. If you record your fuel costs and odometer readings, it\u2019ll also\nproduce automated fuel efficiency reports, allowing you to see just how\nefficient your driving is.\n\nOne of the things I really like is the customisation aspect. You can change\nmost of the units, allowing you to set it up for our weird UK system where we\ndrive miles, buy fuel in litres and calculate the fuel efficiency by the\ngallon!\n\n  * Download\n\n### aCar (3.1 / 5)\n\nWith a million downloads, I had high hopes for aCar. Thankfully, it more than\nlives up to the hype.\n\nOn the surface, aCar is like most other logging apps but it really\ndistinguishes itself in how easy it is to use. Fire up the app and you\u2019ll be\nscheduling upcoming maintenance work in seconds.\n\n  * Download\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you find what you\u2019re looking for with these apps. Some are\ncomplimentary, so play around and download a few and see which works best for\nyou!\n\nTo keep you on track of your routine maintenance, check out our car\nmaintenance checklist and these expert car maintenance tips!\n\n#### What's Covered\n\n  * Introduction\n  * Best Apps For iPhone\n  * Best Apps for Android\n  * Conclusion\n\n\u00d7\n\n__\n\n#### Contact Us\n\n  * support@leasefetcher.co.uk\n\nWhat Lease Ltd  \nSavoy Tower  \n77 Renfrew St  \nGlasgow  \nScotland G2 3BZ\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Lease Fetcher\n  * Lease Fetcher News\n\n#### Useful Links\n\n  * Car Model vs Model\n  * Best Cars\n  * Discontinued Cars\n  * Treating Customers Fairly\n  * Complaints Procedure\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n#### Let's Get Social\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\nWhat Lease Ltd trading as Lease Fetcher and What Lease Ltd is authorised and\nregulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (774111).
