I've used it a few\ntimes, and find it to be a really good idea that's kind of poorly implemented.\nThe reminders are nice, and the MPG calculator can be a fun tool. But the way\nit was made drives me nuts, and unfortunately away from the product, as the\nthe UI and odd design choices make this app a struggle to enjoy. More\n\n  * by Brian Marshall\n\nreviewed on August 28, 2018\n\nMaybe this app is useful if you own several cars or if your car can use gas of\nseveral grades. I have just one car and use only one type of gas, so there is\nreally nothing to optimize. There is an indicator on my dashboard that reminds\nme when it's time to change the oil.\n\n More\n\n## 4.aCar\n\nwith in-app purchases\n\naCar is an app which helps you track your car and its necessities and\nmaintenance needs like fuel mileage and cost, trips, and general expenses.

I love it.\nMore\n\n  * by buffmaster0001 null\n\nreviewed on May 17, 2019\n\naCar was AWESOME!! Then it got bought out be Fuelly and it's terrible now.
