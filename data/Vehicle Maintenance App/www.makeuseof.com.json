Why not use an app to keep track of\neverything that needs doing?\n\nReaders like you help support MUO. When you make a purchase using links on our\nsite, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More.\n\nOwning your own car gives you a feeling of independence, but keeping up all\nthe required maintenance for that car can be overwhelming. From oil changes to\ntire rotations to fluid flushes, there's a lot that goes into maintaining your\nvehicle.\n\nLuckily, there are apps out there that can help you manage everything. You\nmight get maintenance reminders from your local car care center or sometimes\nhave a sticker inside your windshield with a recommended date for your next\noil change. But having an app that's on your smartphone, which you have with\nyou every day, keeps you updated with all the important info you need.\n\nSo, it's time to check out the six best apps for car maintenance and tips.\n\n##  1\\. AUTOsist\n\nClose\n\nThe AUTOsist app helps you manage your car with an interface that's easy to\nuse. When you open the app, you'll see all the cars you've entered in your\nvirtual garage. With the app's free version, you can only add one vehicle.\n\nIf you want to add up to five vehicles, you'll have to pay a one-time fee of\n$19.99 for the Pro version; if you want to add more than that, you'll need the\nGold plan, which costs $49.99 per year.\n\nWith each vehicle, you can add the type, trim, odometer reading, license plate\nnumber, VIN number, and a nickname for the vehicle for easy organization. You\ncan also snap a picture of your vehicles so you can quickly identify them.\n\nSelecting a vehicle on the home screen allows you to access service records,\nfuel records, trip logs, personal notes, reminders, and more. Adding a new\nservice, like an oil change, takes about five minutes or less, depending on\nhow detailed you get. You can add pictures, the odometer reading, which shop\nwas used, and notes to any service entry.\n\n**Download:** AUTOsist for Android | iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)\n\n##  2\\. Fuelly or aCar\n\nClose\n\nThe Fuelly app and the aCar app are the exact same app, just on two different\noperating systems. If you have an Android phone, you'll download aCar, and if\nyou use an iPhone, you'll use Fuelly.\n\nThe home screen is colorful, bringing a little life to something as mundane as\nservicing your car. Similar to AUTOsist, Fuelly lets you keep track of records\nrelated to fuel, service, and trips, as well as write out detailed notes and\nset up reminders for yourself.\n\nYou can also keep up with any vehicle-related expenses, accidents, vehicle\nparts that have been replaced, and even the sale of your car. If there are\nservices you'll know will be repeated, like oil changes and tire rotations,\nyou can add them to your Services section. Then, when you need to enter an oil\nchange service record, you can quickly select Oil Change from your menu.\n\n**Download:** aCar for Android (Free, premium subscription available)\n\n**Download:** Fuelly for iOS (Free, premium subscription available)\n\n##  3\\. CARFAX Car Care\n\nClose\n\nCARFAX is a popular service when it comes to purchasing a new car, so most\npeople are probably familiar with it. What you might not know, however, is\nthat there's a CARFAX Car Care app that can help you keep track of every\nservice performed on your car without you even having to lift a finger.\n\nWell, you'll have to enter your car's VIN number to find your car, but after\nthat, you're golden! Because of how CARFAX naturally works, it pulls all of\nyour car's service information and displays it for you to see. From there,\nit'll recommend when you should get your next oil change or tire rotation,\nwhen your registration needs to be renewed, and more.\n\nThere's also a helpful section of the app that helps you estimate costs on\ncertain repairs. This can help immensely if you're unsure of what things cost\nso that you don't get ripped off by an untrustworthy service center.\n\nIf you're buying a used car, the CARFAX Car Care app is especially helpful\nbecause it pulls up records based on the VIN number. So even if you don't have\nphysical records of the work that's been done on a vehicle, you can likely see\na virtual record through CARFAX's system.\n\n**Download:** CARFAX Car Care for Android | iOS (Free)\n\n##  4\\. Simply Auto\n\nClose\n\nSimply Auto is another great app to keep your car up-to-date with all\nservices. Maintaining your car is typically a stressful task, but Simply Auto\nmakes it, well, simple!\n\nFirst, you'll need to enter your vehicle, and then you can start keeping\nrecords of everything pertaining to that vehicle. There's a plus sign on the\nhome screen that makes it easy to add new records. From the home screen, you\ncan enter new fill-ups, services, expenses, trips, or odometer readings.\n\nTo get an overview of all the services and costs related to your vehicle, you\ncan switch from the Dashboard tab to the Stats & Charts tab. There, you can\nsee Total Stats, Average Fuel Stats, Trip Stats, and more.\n\nThrough the Simply Auto app, you can also use a feature called Auto Trip\nLogging. If you enable this, it'll automatically detect vehicle motion and\nenter your trips for you. You can track 15 trips for free, or upgrade to the\nPlatinum plan for $9.99 per year or a one-time fee of $29.99.\n\n**Download:** Simply Auto for Android | iOS (Free, premium subscription\navailable)\n\n##  5\\. Drivvo\n\nClose\n\nWhen you open Drivvo, you can immediately see an overview of all the previous\ndates of service for your vehicle. This is an incredibly helpful way to keep\ntrack of when you last took your car in for an oil change or how long ago you\ngot your tires changed.\n\nTapping the plus sign at the bottom of the screen allows you to enter records\nof income, service, expenses, refueling, routes traveled, and reminders for\nthe future. When entering a new service record, there's a long list of service\ntypes already preloaded in the app, making the process even easier.\n\nOn the reports tab, you can see an overview of collected information and\ncharts that represent your data. There are general reports and reports\nspecific to refueling, expenses, income, and services.\n\n**Download:** Drivvo for Android | iOS (Free, premium subscription available)\n\n##  6\\. myEZ Car Care\n\nClose\n\nThe myEZ Car Care app has a simple interface that may look outdated, but it\nfunctions well and makes it easy to keep track of your car's maintenance\nneeds. Certain features of the app are locked behind a VIP subscription plan\nstarting at $9.99 per year. But the majority of the features are available to\nuse for free!\n\nEvery time you take your car in for an oil change, a fluid flush, new brake\npads, or anything else, you can enter it as a new record. You can also set\nreminders for yourself to get push notifications on your phone every time you\nneed to take your car in.\n\nThen, if you enter information when you fuel your car up at the gas station,\nthe app can automatically calculate your gas mileage for you. Staying up to\ndate with your car's gas mileage is one of the best ways to make sure you're\nnot wasting money on gas. And if you're after more ways to save money, there\nare apps out there dedicated to helping you be thrifty and save money on your\ncar's expenses.\n\n**Download:** myEZ Car Care for Android | iOS (Free, premium subscription\navailable)\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n##  Taking Care of Your Car Has Never Been Easier\n\nAs a car owner, there's a lot involved in properly maintaining your car. Just\nlike with your own body, you have to make sure that you're getting regular\ncheckups, fueling up with the best stuff, and mending things when they're\nbroken or failing.\n\nHaving an app that you regularly use on your smartphone makes having and\nmaintaining a vehicle much easier. You don't have to worry about going through\npaper records in your filing cabinet because everything is right there on your\nphone!\n\n## Upgrade Your Tech IQ With Our Free Newsletters\n\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional\ndeal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\n\nComments\n\nShare Share Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nShare Share Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Electric Vehicles\n  * Technology Explained\n  * Car Maintenance\n  * Automotive Technology\n  * Transportation\n  * Electric Car\n  * Travel\n\nAbout The Author\n\nSarah Chaney  (177 Articles Published)\n\nSarah Chaney is a professional freelance writer for MakeUseOf, Review Geek,\nLaptop Mag, and other publications.
