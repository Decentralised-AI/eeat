It's super easy to use, the interface is unfussy and dependable, and\nthe cloud sync makes it really easy to migrate data to a new phone. The ONLY\nfeedback I have is that now that I am driving an EV it would be nice if there\nwas an option to change the fill up data to EV-specific charging stats such as\nkWh delivered, miles driven, etc. Otherwise, I no longer have any use for this\napp moving forward.\n\n15 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nRay Burrows\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n\nAugust 20, 2023\n\nFor record-keeping, I'm mostly happy with the app. However, I've reached out\nto support multiple times (March 2023 and August 13 2023) with zero response\nfrom them. Not so much as an automated response from their ticketing system\n(assuming they use one).
