Once you\u2019ve found a good\nmechanic, you can stay on top of your car\u2019s service schedule with the help of\na car maintenance app. A vehicle maintenance app tracks everything from\nregular oil changes and tire rotations to some of the longer interval service\nrequirements for modern cars.\n\nCar maintenance tracking apps allow you to record past service events and get\na notification when your car is due for some TLC, whether checking your car\u2019s\nfluids or changing your car\u2019s air filter. While the scope and functionality\nwill vary from one app to another, they perform similar functions. We\u2019ve\nselected four well-reviewed car maintenance apps that are free (albeit with\nin-app purchases) and offer solid options for both Apple iOS and Google\nAndroid users. All references to ratings, number of reviews, and prices are\ncurrent as of January 2023.\n\n## Top 4 car maintenance apps\n\n### Fuelly\n\nWith a 4.5-star rating after more than 4,500 reviews, this iPhone-only car\nmaintenance app is a popular option. Fuelly\u2019s main functionality is tracking\nfuel costs and consumption for your car, but this vehicle maintenance app lets\nyou set up reminders for service and track other vehicle information.\n\nFuelly can keep track of multiple vehicles, sync to the cloud at fuelly.com,\nand export all information for additional reporting. Fuelly is free, but the\n$4.99 premium version of the app removes ads and offers unlimited attachments.\n\n### aCar\n\naCar is essentially Fuelly for Google\u2019s Android platform and remains one of\nthe most popular options on the Google Play Store, with a 4.4-star rating\nfollowing more than 20,000 reviews and over 1 million downloads. Like Fuelly,\ndrivers can use aCar to track multiple vehicles for fuel consumption, mileage,\nservice records, and service interval tracking. It can also sync to the cloud\nat fuelly.com.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a weekend driver with a single vehicle, a vehicle enthusiast,\nor a professional that drives for a living, aCar offers a wide range of useful\nand cost-saving functionality. aCar is free, but aCar Pro is available for\n$6.99. The premium version includes integration with social media, additional\nwidgets and tools for the Android interface, and the ability to export your\ndata for further reporting.\n\n### Autosist\n\nAutosist is a popular car maintenance app available for Android and iPhone and\nwell-reviewed on both platforms. Autosist is cloud-based and offers the usual\nsuite of mileage, fuel, service records, and planned service interval\ntracking. You can use Autosist to manage other vehicles like planes, RVs, and\nboats. With functions that span from the simple to the more in-depth,\nAutosist\u2019s main limitation is that the free version of the app only allows for\nmanaging a single vehicle. Those with multiple vehicles will need to pay\nanywhere from $9.99 to $19.99, depending on the number of vehicles they would\nlike to manage with Autosist.\n\n### Drivvo\n\nWith versions for both Android and iPhone, Drivvo has been downloaded more\nthan 1.5 million times and currently holds a 4.6-star rating after more than\n44,000 reviews. Drivvo, which offers similar functionality to most vehicle\nmaintenance apps, distinguishes itself by its efficient interface. The free\nversion includes fuel pricing, mileage, consumption, service records, and\nservice internal tracking for multiple vehicles and a range of reports and\nstatistics. The Pro version of Drivvo costs $6 a year on an annual plan. It\noffers the ability to sync your data to the cloud (and to multiple devices),\nno ads, excel exporting, and access to technical support.\n\nWith the help of one of these apps, you\u2019ll never again forget an oil change or\nhunt through a glove box full of receipts and forgotten handwritten notes from\nyour mechanic.
