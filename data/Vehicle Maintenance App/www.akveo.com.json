According to the most recent research, the logistics market will rise\nto around 13 billion by 2027 compared to 7 billion in 2017. Considering the\nlockdown that paralyzed the dynamic traffic of supply chains and logistic\ncompanies worldwide, it is pretty good growth.\n\nIndeed, those troubles have only made logistic businesses stiffer and\ncompelled them to integrate state-of-art tech solutions like IoT sensors, GPS,\nand specialized software. Tech equipment has become the core criterion of the\nfittest\u2019s survival within the logistics ecosystem. So, to stay on your feet,\nyou should keep your hand on the pulse of fleet management software\ninnovations.  \n\nHowever, many managers have a hard time choosing and implementing the right\nfleet management system. That makes them less productive than business rivals\nand threatens to send them out of business. But we are going to give them a\nlifeline with the ultimate guide on how to choose the best vehicle maintenance\napp in 2022. Further, you\u2019ll know:  \n\n  * How fleet management software contributes to your success;\n  * What features make the great fleet maintenance app;\n  * The guideline to pick the right one.  \n\n## How fleet management software can help you\n\nFleet management software is a great companion to your business that can bring\nbenefits on multiple levels:\n\n### Reduces expenses\n\nA proper fleet management application can save your money in many ways. First\nof all, it frees you from the middlemen between you and your drivers. It means\nthat you reduce your salary payments and manage the processes faster.\n\nThen, the preventive maintenance feature of a car maintenance app allows you\nto avoid high repair costs. The logic is simple: the sooner you know that\nsomething is wrong with a vehicle, the less money you\u2019ll pay to fix it.  \n\nWhat\u2019s more, such apps, paired with IoT sensors and GPS, track fuel\nconsumption and plan optimal routes. These features make the delivery faster\nand reduce your resource consumption.  \n\n### Enhances fleet performance\n\nThe route planning feature streamlines the effectiveness of your vehicles too.\nSuggesting the best way to reach the destination, the app eliminates fleet\ndowntime.  \n\nFleet maintenance apps allow managers to connect with the drivers at any time\nand give urgent instructions. For instance, you can redirect a car in a\npriority area or inform a driver about vehicle breakage on the go.  \n\nAlso, the vehicles\u2019 health tracking tools assist you to schedule maintenance\nworks with perfect timing. As a result, you will reduce fleet downtime and\nalways have your cars in top condition.\n\n### Brings valuable insights\n\nPowerful big data tools paired with the right fleet maintenance app show you\nthe bigger perspective on your business\u2019s functioning. With the help of the\ninformation, you get the statistics on fuel consumption, drivers\u2019 behavior\npatterns, various expenses, and income. It will present it on a clickable\ndashboard that demonstrates the information in comprehensive charts, graphs,\netc.  \n\nHaving all that insights in front of you, you can build an effective marketing\nstrategy easily. Additionally, analysis of the fleet-related metrics will help\nyou to propel your business workflow.  \n\n## Features a Fleet Maintenance App Should Have\n\nAlright, as we\u2019ve reviewed the benefits of using such apps, let\u2019s dive into\nthe fleet management software features themselves. Here, you\u2019ll find the\nfeatures that top fleet maintenance apps must include.  \n\n### Positioning & Route planning\n\nUsing GPS (Global Positioning System), fleet management software displays the\nlocation of any car of your company in real-time. This feature also builds\noptimal routes for your vehicles to avoid traffic jams and be at the\ndestination point as soon as possible.  \n\nIn addition, vehicle monitoring features enhance the customer experience. When\nyou know the pace and the route of your vehicle, you can predict the time it\ncomes to a customer. If you embed the timer in your customers\u2019 apps, they will\nsee the estimated delivery time. Apart from this, you can inform the receiver\nif there is any delay. The feature is a must for B2B relationships. There,\nsupply timing failures affect not only the business relationships but can\nresult in additional costs.  \n\n### Advanced communication tools\n\nTo give orders and get updates from the drivers faster, fleet maintenance\nsoftware offers various communication tools. On the one hand, a driver can\nleave his/her comment below the work item. Thus, they inform you about\nunexpected events that hinder the work processes or ask for assistance and\nissue specifications. On the other hand, you can guide your employees\ninstantly. It applies to drivers and maintenance workers to whom you can give\ndetailed task instructions. This helps to avoid possible misunderstandings.  \n\nEventually, you can get rid of paperwork and old-fashioned communication\nmethods. This feature makes the fleet management process as easy as a tap on\nyour smartphone.\n\n### Preventive maintenance\n\nFleet vehicle maintenance app prevents serious vehicle damage by tracking its\nhealth parameters in real-time. Due to that feature, you can find and\neliminate any malfunction proactively. In the first place, you can set\nobsolescence reminders in your app to never miss routine maintenance works.  \n\nMoreover, IoT sensors scan parts of the vehicles that are prone to wearing.\nThen, they send the reports to an app, and it presents the component\u2019s state\nin your interface. Depending on the conditions, you decide whether to take\nurgent actions, schedule the maintenance later, or replace the vehicle.\nAfterward, you can streamline the mechanics\u2019 work by sending him/her the\nbreakage report. This feature is what makes the best car maintenance app. But\nthe picture\u2019s worth a thousand words.\n\nAkveo fleet maintenance dashboard.\n\n### Fuel Management\n\nAlthough the world is moving towards electric engines, currently, fuel is the\nblood of most vehicles on the planet. Given that the fleet is the heart of the\nlogistic industry, we can see fuel as what makes it beat. Therefore, thorough\nfuel consumption control is crucial for healthy logistic business development\nand requires a practical fuel management approach.  \n\nSoftware fleet maintenance service in tandem with particular sensors keeps\ntrack of the fuel flow in real-time. Also, a worthy app should monitor the\nvehicles\u2019 idle time so you can see where it happens more often. Besides, it\ncan estimate its cost and create fuel consumption reports. They will come in\nhandy when you plan a budget or make an analysis to improve your fuel\nefficiency.\n\n### Asset & Driver Safety\n\nDriving is a complex task that demands much concentration and resilience. A\ngood manager knows that and makes everything possible to make sure the drivers\nwork in comfortable conditions. Top-of-the-line fleet management apps do a\ngreat job keeping vehicle operators sound and safe.  \n\nFirst of all, a driver\u2019s smartwatch or other devices that track his/her heart\nrate, blood pressure, and oxygen level can be connected to an app. In this\nway, you can get a notification when a driver feels ill. This feature allows\npreventing any accidents caused by health issues. Apart from that, IoT sensors\ncan measure temperature in a car cabin and flag the drivers if it becomes too\nhigh or low.  \n\nBy itself, driver safety features improve asset durability. Though, you can\nequip your fleet with dash cameras. They will record and store the information\non the road\u2019s footage or dangerous situations. Also, in case of a car crash,\nthe video records can serve as evidence. On top of that, you get rid of\nspeeding and aggressive driving by analyzing drivers\u2019 behavior patterns. You\ncan even turn it into a fun game with prize money, giving marks for driving\nsafety to your workers and finding the safest one.  \n\n### Work time tracking\n\nCar maintenance tracking apps are capable of monitoring the time on the road\nof the drivers. Although it seems like a simple and subsidiary feature, it is\na must for fleet management. To comply with Hours of Service regulations, you\nneed to know exactly what time your employees are on the move. It echoes with\nsafety because the HOS regulations were designed as a deterrent to work-overs.\nThe latter is one of the main reasons for car crashes nowadays. Failing to\nprovide team working hours and comply with the regulations will inevitably\nresult in the loss of license.\n\n## Choosing the right fleet maintenance app\n\nGraphic provided by Crazy Egg.\n\nIn this section, we will touch on the points to consider when choosing a fleet\nmanagement app.  \n\n### Usability\n\nEase of use is essential for fleet maintenance apps. The interface should be\nintuitive and convenient for you to have instant access to the core features.\nOtherwise, it loses half of its purpose if you waste time making sense of the\nintricate settings. Simply put, a good app will offer you all the essentials\nin a tap & swipe distance.  \n\nFrom the driver\u2019s side, the best car maintenance app should also be easy as\npie. Drivers will need a tool that doesn\u2019t steal much attention and provides\ncomprehensible data.\n\n### Data processing & insights\n\nThe quality of the insights you get from your app heavily depends on its\nability to process big data. Thus, you\u2019ll need one that supports a good\ndatabase. It\u2019s necessary to store more statistical data and various work-\nrelated records.  \n\nApart from storage, a proper auto maintenance app must be able to process and\nshowcase the information in a digestible way. The more valuable information\ncharts, diagrams, graphics you can have on your screen, the better. Usually,\ngreat apps support specialized fleet management dashboards that you can get\nfor free. You can have a look at the free dashboard below to see how many\nperformance metrics it displays.\n\nReal-time data presentation in a fleet maintenance software dashboard.\n\n### Integration Capacity\n\nThe software you choose should be able to integrate other fleet management\nsolutions. To expand the functionality of the fleet maintenance app, you need\nto have the ability to apply additional tools. It can be routing and payroll\nsystems, HR management software, and more. That\u2019s why the capacity of the app\nto integrate more of such tools will define the level of your fleet\nproductivity.  \n\n## Resume\n\nTo consolidate the message, let\u2019s make a brief outline of the benefits,\nfeatures of the auto maintenance app, and how to choose the right one.  \n\nFleet management apps help logistic businesses to:  \n\n  * Reduce various types of expenses;\n  * Improve fleet performance and keep assets safe;\n  * Manage your personnel more effectively;\n  * Get a clearer picture of your business functioning;\n  * Build an effective business strategy and marketing campaigns;\n  * Enhance customer and partner relations.  \n\nA good fleet maintenance service should offer:  \n\n  * Asset tracking & route planning feature;\n  * Vehicle health checking systems for proactive maintenance;\n  * Fuel management & report creation features;\n  * Safety features for drivers and vehicles;\n  * Work time and mileage tracking features;  \n\nTo pick a proper fleet management application, check the following parameters:  \n\n  * Ease of use and accessibility;\n  * Data processing & storage capacity; \n  * Ability to make valuable insights;\n  * Comprehensive presentation of the info;  \n  * Integration with other tools and technologies;  \n\nHere you go.
