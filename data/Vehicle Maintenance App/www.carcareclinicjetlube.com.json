A\nfew of our customers have said they like to keep receipts in the glove\ncompartment so they can look through them when needed, but that\u2019s no real\nfiling system.  You could do just as well scanning your maintenance receipts\nand putting them into Dropbox or Evernote, or whatever other note-taking tool\nyou prefer.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more portable option though, one that lets you see\nwhat you\u2019ve had done recently, here are a few apps to try:\n\n  * **Road Trip** (iOS) is probably one of the most robust mileage and maintenance tracking apps for iOS available. Tracking fill-ups and mileage is super-fast, as is adding maintenance history, expenses, and reminders for future work. The app has a tire log to track summer and winter wear on your tires, and supports other vehicles like boats and motorcycles. You can track as many vehicles as you like, too. The lite version gives you a taste, but the full version will set you back $5 for the iPhone or the iPad (it\u2019s not a universal app, so you\u2019ll have to buy it twice for both platforms.)\n  * **Car Maintenance Reminder** (Android) is a free app that will keep track of your fuel efficiency, cost, and mileage, but also gives you a place to track all of the maintenance and repairs you have done to your vehicle. You can add notes, costs, and of course, get notifications and reminders when you should get some work done. The free version tracks one vehicle. If you have more than one, the $3 pro version is for you.\n  * **AutoCare** (iOS/Android): AutoCare has been around for a while, and does a pretty good job of tracking your vehicle\u2019s maintenance history, mileage, repair history, service expensives, and more. You can even use it to remind you when it\u2019s time to get something specific done so you won\u2019t forget. Plus, it supports multiple vehicles. It\u2019ll set you back $4 for iOS users, and $2 for Android users.\n  * **Car Minder Plus** (iOS) is another good, simple app for tracking your mileage and your vehicle maintenance. You get presets for things like oil filters, air filters, belt inspections, and oil changes, and you can enter in your own maintenance work and expenses to the log to keep track of what you\u2019ve had done. From there, enter in your service intervals, and the app uses simple red/yellow/green indicators to tell you when it\u2019s time to get that work done. The app will cost you $3.\n  * **aCar** (Android) is free, and one of the most popular Android apps for tracking vehicle maintenance and mileage. Tracking fill-ups and mileage is quick, entering in your maintenance history and expenses is easy, and you can even enter specific notes or information about parts you prefer or that your vehicle requires. The app notifies you based on time and/or mileage when you should have work done, and supports custom notifications. aCar Pro adds in multiple languages, home screen widgets for quick access to data and logging, and connections to other popular car apps and websites, all for $6.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n### New Year, New Car Maintenance Routine\n\n### Signs Your Car Has Pothole Damage\n\n### Our Recommended Car Maintenance Schedule\n\n### Regular Vehicle Maintenance to Avoid Costly Repairs\n\n### Knock Knock \u2013 Wrong Octane\n\n### Our Locations\n\n **Brandon: Crossgates**  \nCall | Info\n\n**North Jackson**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Metrocenter**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Ridgeland: Old Canton Road**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Jackson: I-55 Frontage Road**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Vicksburg**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Pearl**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Flowood: Lakeland Drive East**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Forest**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Magee**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Madison**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Ridgeland**  \nCall | Info\n\n**Flowood: Lakeland Drive West**  \nCall | Info\n\n **Vicksburg: Hwy 61**  \nCall | Info\n\nSince 1977, Car Care Clinic has been all about customer relations,\nfriendliness, and top quality professional service.
