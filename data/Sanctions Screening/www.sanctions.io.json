It's a\ncrucial process for businesses in regulated and non-regulated industries. Why?\nBecause governments are increasingly dishing out hefty financial penalties for\nnon-compliance. In this guide, you'll learn everything to know about sanctions\nscreening.\n\nPaul Dixon\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nNew Sanctions Screening Guide\n\nDownload our FREE Sanctions Screening Guide and learn how to set up an\neffective Sanctions Screening Process in your organization.\n\nDownload Now\n\n##  **What Is Sanctions Screening?**\n\nSanctions screening allows companies to efficiently screen customers, clients,\nor suppliers against sanctions lists. The process is part of a broader anti-\nmoney laundering (AML) compliance plan that all companies and organizations\nwith international exposure should incorporate.\n\nIn this comprehensive sanctions screening guide, we will cover the following:  \n\n  *  **Why Is Sanctions Screening Important?**\n  *  **What Are Sanctions?**\n  *  **What Are Sanctions Lists & Sanctions Databases?**\n  *  **How Does Sanctions Screening Work?**\n  *  **How to Set Up Effective Sanctions Screening Processes?**\n  *  **7 Sanctions Screening Best Practices**\n\nEach business has unique sanctions obligations to follow, depending on the\njurisdictions and sectors in which they operate. Laws vary depending on the\ncountry, impacting which industries must legally screen customers for\nsanctions.\n\nFor example, the sanctions.io blog reports that OFAC sanctions compliance is\nessential for software companies. All businesses and organizations with\ninternational exposure must seek local AML advice or hire qualified\nprofessionals for their unique circumstances.\n\n\u200d _But it's important not to over-complicate this.  _\n\n###  **Use US Dollars in Business? Sanctions Screening Is a Must**\n\nRegardless of complex sanctions rules, here is a fact: In today's globalized\nand digital world, a vast amount of businesses are international to a degree -\nwhether through the customers they seek online or the products and services\nthey import or contract over the Internet.\n\nFrom companies in Australia to the UK, and everywhere in between, two things\nare now widespread:\n\n  *  **International customers & suppliers**\n  *  **Payment in dollars is essential**\n\nDoes your business have international customers and suppliers? Do you trade\nusing US dollars? Perhaps you are nodding your head to both. And here is an\nexample of why global sanctions screening is fundamental: As far as the US\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is concerned, any foreign party avails\nitself to the US financial system if it trades in dollars - and hence becomes\nsubject to US sanctions laws.\n\nThe above is just one example. The UN, EU, and UK sanctions lists are also\nequally important - violations may lead to hefty financial penalties, severe\nlimitations on your financial flows, and reputational damage.\n\nBecause of all the above risks, global sanctions screening is increasingly\npopular for regulated and non-regulated businesses. **\u200d**\n\n##  **Why Is Sanctions Screening Important?**\n\nSanctions screening is an increasingly important process that all companies\nand organizations with international exposure should initiate. **Here are\nseven reasons why sanctions screening is important:**\n\n###  **Avoid Large Financial Penalties**\n\nIn 2022, there was a 50% surge in money laundering fines. Violating sanctions\nlaws comes under the broader money laundering umbrella. And a large percentage\nof the above statistic comes from sanctions violations. For example, at the\ntime of writing, Wells Fargo was fined almost $100 million for sanctions\nviolations.\n\nSanction evasion is also increasingly in the spotlight. The DOJ announced in\nMarch 2023 that it plans to hire over 25 new prosecutors to go after companies\nwho knowingly (or unknowingly) break sanctions laws.\n\nBoth smaller companies and large ones are fined for sanctions breaches. You\ncan learn more here. Sanctions screening software minimizes the risk of\nreceiving such penalties.\n\n###  **Avoid Reputational Damage**\n\nReceiving a sanctions penalty may result in severe reputational damage to a\ncompany. It's important to remember that sanctioned individuals and companies\nare often associated with heinous crimes such as human trafficking and\nextortion. Any company that even unknowingly abetted illicit criminal activity\nmay receive a public backlash. Its reputation with customers, regulators,\nemployees, and other stakeholders may also suffer.\n\n###  **Be Compliant with Sanctions Laws**\n\nCompliance with relevant sanctions laws is integral to a company's broader\ncompliance processes (e.g., data protection, cyber compliance). Sanctions\nscreening software helps businesses stay compliant and thus avoid issues with\nregulatory bodies.\n\n###  **Reduce Money Laundering Exposure Risk (AML)**\n\nSanctions and money laundering are inextricably connected. Individuals and\ncompanies on sanctions lists are severely restricted - and are forced to take\nillegal money-laundering actions to move funds.\n\nThey may also be on sanctions lists because of money laundering offenses. By\nactivating robust sanctions screening processes, businesses can minimize the\nrisk of funds flowing through their accounts from sanctioned individuals or\nentities.\n\n###  **Reduce the Risk of the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)**\n\nAnother illegal activity, the financing of terrorism, is also related to\nsanctions and the broader money laundering umbrella. As sanctions.io reported,\nthe Lafarge Sanctions Violation Case is an example of a company breaking\nsanctions laws, pleading guilty to conspiring to provide material support to\nthe Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).\n\nSanctions screening solutions help businesses minimize the risk of the illegal\nfinancing of terrorism as part of a Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)\nprocess.\n\n###  **Reduce the Risk of Fraud**\n\nTwo related offenses come under the financial crime spectrum: Money laundering\nand fraud. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes, such as identity verification,\nhelp reduce fraud - but it also minimizes the risk of money laundering.\nEqually, anti-money laundering (AML) methods, such as **sanctions screening**\n, also reduce the risk of both money laundering and fraud.\n\n###  **Ethical Responsibilities**\n\nAll companies and organizations have an ethical responsibility to themselves\nand their stakeholders to prevent money launderers from using their businesses\nto launder dirty money. Sanctions screening supports ethical and responsible\nbusiness practices.\n\n##  **What Are Sanctions?**\n\nIn reality, many businesses, especially SMEs and start-ups, don't need to bog\nthemselves down in the intricate details of sanctions - that's why they\nconsult experts. They want peace of mind that they aren't dealing with\nsanctioned individuals and entities, exposing themselves to severe sanction\nviolation punishments.\n\nAnd that's why sanctions screening services like sanctions.io are now\nfundamental to doing business. But it's still important to understand what\nsanctions are.\n\nSanctions are a tool used by countries, or international organizations such as\nthe UN, to put economic or political pressure on a country (or countries) to\ndiscourage, punish or influence behavior.\n\nIt's important to remember this: Sanctions are **not** embargoes. The\nsanctions.io blog discusses the difference between sanctions and embargoes,\nbut in a nutshell, embargoes are partial to complete trading bans. Sanctions\nare more targeted - for example, UN sanctions limiting oil and refined\npetroleum imports to North Korea.\n\nSanctions are an increasingly hot topic, especially since the 2022 Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine. Intriguing stories of sanctioned Russian oligarchs moving\nsuperyachts between Mediterranean ports have made national news and captured\nthe public's attention.\n\nThere are different kinds of sanctions, from diplomatic to sporting, to travel\nand cyber. However, the most common type of sanction is the one that hits the\ntarget where it hurts most - in the pocket. Economic sanctions may restrict or\nprohibit trade, investment, and financial transactions between the sanctioning\ncounty (or countries) and the sanctioned entity.\n\nFor example, the relationship between a sanctioning country and the sanctioned\ncountry could mean:\n\n  *  **A ban on financial transactions**\n  *  **Restrictions on trade**\n  *  **An investment ban**\n\nAnd here is the reality: The world is overflowing with economic sanctions from\nmany countries and organizations, targeting countries from North Korea and\nIran to Zimbabwe and Russia.\n\n _But how is this all relevant to your business?_\n\nIt's relevant because if your company trades, even unknowingly, with\nsanctioned individuals or entities, you will expose your business (and\nyourself) to civil and criminal penalties. We discuss the cost of neglecting\nsanctions list screening on the sanctions.io blog.\n\n##  **What Are Sanctions Lists & Sanctions Databases?**\n\n###  **Sanctions Lists**\n\nHere are the four significant sanctions lists from around the world:\n\nIf _sanctions_ are a strategy to discourage, punish or influence behavior,\nthen _sanctions lists_ are the tactic for achieving the objective. It's best\nto think of it this way: Politicians will agree on sanctions against an entity\n(such as Russia). Civil servants from government departments then identify\nindividuals, companies, and organizations to go on the sanctions lists.\n\nThe lists are carefully curated to maximize pressure on the sanctioned\ncountry. In the case of sanctions against Russia, billionaire Russian\noligarchs are on sanctions lists - and the consequences are tangible. For\nexample, their children may no longer attend British elite schools.\n\nAnd appearing on a sanctions list may lead to punishment more than financial.\nIt's also humiliating, especially for individuals from elite circles.\nInformation such as passport number, address, the types of assets frozen, and\nmore are held for each entry and are publicly available.\n\nKnowing which sanctions lists to screen can be a challenge. Businesses must\nconsider the relevant sanctioning bodies (with sanctions lists to screen)\nactive in the countries and territories they trade, and the currencies they\ncomplete transactions. However, the following sanctioning bodies are the most\nimportant.\n\nFailure to comply with any of the below sanctions lists may cause serious\nissues to any company or organization with international exposure:\n\n  * The **OFAC Sanctions List** applies to all US citizens and corporate entities constituted in the US, as well **as any entity that either trades in US dollars, US goods, or US components** or that has a US parent or affiliate. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is its regulatory body.  \n\n  * The **UN Sanctions** list applies to all UN Nation-states. The UN Council oversees it. \n\n  * The **EU Consolidated List of Sanctions** applies to all EU citizens or corporate entities constituted in a member state. The EU Council oversees it.\n\n  * The **HM Treasury Sanctions List** applies to all individuals and legal entities   \nwithin or who undertake activities within the United Kingdom and all UK\nnationals and legal entities established under UK law. It's enforced and\noverseen by OFSI (the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation).\n\n###  **Sanctions Databases**\n\nA _sanctions database_ pools global sanctions lists together into one\ndatabase. For example, sanctions.io's developer-friendly database contains all\nof the above sanctions lists and from countries such as Australia, Canada,\nSwitzerland, France, the UAE, and many more. Additional lists are always\navailable on demand.\n\nOur AI-powered sanctions database updates every 60 minutes and contains\ncleansed and enriched data - ensuring the information is accurate and high-\nquality. The following section will discuss how sanctions databases allow for\neffective and efficient **sanctions screening** in various use cases.\n\n##  **How Does Sanctions Screening Work?**\n\nSanctions screening works by checking individuals, companies, and\norganizations against all the global sanctions lists (such as OFAC & UN\nlists).\n\nSanctions screening can be as simple as manually typing a name into a\nsanctions database, hitting enter, and seeing the results instantly appear.\nHowever, companies and organizations with numerous clients, customers, and\nsuppliers require **scalable, frictionless sanctions screening solutions**\nthat blend into their business processes.\n\n\u200d _Sanctions screening services not only offer the most up-to-date lists\npooled into one database. The value to the customer is also how screening\nefficiently takes place at scale._\n\n **Here are types of sanctions screening solutions:**\n\n###  **Transaction Sanctions Screening**\n\nTransaction sanctions screening works through an API offered by the screening\nprovider. For example, InsurTech companies have a USP that traditional\ninsurance firms don't have: New customer approvals in a matter of clicks.\n\nTo achieve this, the InsurTech company screens the customer for sanctions when\ncompleting other Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks through APIs, as offered by\nservices such as sanctions.io. Our developer-friendly, enterprise-grade\nRESTful API has guaranteed uptime of more than 99.99% and ~200ms response\ntime.\n\n###  **Batch Sanctions Screening**\n\n\u200dBatch Sanctions Screening is when the company or organization has\nimplemented, for example, an automated daily check on all its customers' and\nsuppliers' databases through a screening providers' API. This solution is\nrapidly increasing in use. As reported on the sanctions.io blog, governments\nare more than ever punishing any company involved in sanctions evasion\n(knowingly or unknowingly) from regulated and non-regulated sectors.\n\n###  **Manual Batch Sanctions Screening**\n\nManual Batch Sanctions Screening allows companies and organizations to upload\na .csv file containing customer and supplier data to the sanctions screening\nprovider. Results are instantly available, and there is no requirement to set\nup an API (although manual batch screening through an API is also standard).\n\n##  **How to Set Up Effective Sanctions Screening Processes?**\n\nSetting up an effective **sanctions screening process** is one of the more\ndaunting tasks for businesses and organizations without screening experience\nor who do not have a qualified compliance officer in their ranks.\n\nAll companies should consult with sanctions and AML compliance experts to\ncreate an adequate sanctions screening process. To help you, sanctions.io put\ntogether a free effective sanctions screening process guide. The guide covers\nthe following essential steps:\n\n  *  **Identifying sanctions risks for your business (risk assessment)**\n  *  **Cleaning up & creating high-quality data**\n  *  **Determining relevant data to screen**\n  *  **Identifying relevant sanctions lists**\n  *  **Type of screening solutions required  **\n  *  **Screening intervals (e.g. transactional, daily)**\n  *  **Handling matches (e.g. false positives, whitelisting, etc.)**\n\nA reality of sanctions screening is that challenges exist. For example,\nscreening names written in Chinese, Cyrillic, or Arabic alphabets (different\nwriting systems or naming conventions) may create issues. The quality of data\nand how its structured also present obstacles. We'll be discussing _sanctions\nscreening best practices_ in the next section.\n\n **If you want more information and guidance about setting up a sanctions\nscreening process, don't hesitate to** **contact sanctions.io** **for an\nobligation-free discussion.** You can also find some further tips here.\n\n##  **7 Sanctions Screening Best Practices**\n\nThe most critical sanctions screening best practice is to **get started** \\-\nand to have a form of sanctions screening in place. It's surprisingly simple\nto do. For example, upload a .csv file with customer data into a sanctions\nscreening database and see if any matches appear (and take action). This step\nalone goes a long way in meeting sanctions compliance obligations.\n\nBut as alluded to earlier, sanctions screening is not a perfect science. Like\nmany business processes, there are always ways to improve **effectiveness**.\nContinuous improvement is also fundamental in sanctions screening.\n\nHere are some best practices for your sanctions screening journey:\n\n  1.  **Collect High-Quality Customer Data**\n  2.  **Seek Expert AML Advice**\n  3.  **Use Sanctions Screening Technology**\n  4.  **Use the Best Sanctions Databases**\n  5.  **Use Sanctions Screening Automation Tools**\n  6.  **Integrate Sanctions Screening in CRM Tools**\n  7.  **Red Flags? Know What Actions To Take**\n\n###  **Collect and Store High-Quality Customer Data**\n\nData quality issues do trip up sanction screening processes. Incomplete or\ninaccurate customer information can lead to **false positives** (when the\nmatch is **not** the sanctioned individual). Data issues can also mean even\nworse - missing detections of sanctioned individuals and entities. Companies\nshould ensure that KYC data is compiled, cleaned, and mapped across all\nrelevant systems.\n\n###  **Seek Expert AML Advice**\n\nAs mentioned in the guide previously, all companies with international\nexposure must seek local AML advice or hire qualified professionals for their\nunique circumstances. Different industries (regulated and non-regulated) have\ndiffering sanctions compliance obligations depending on the jurisdictions\ntheir businesses operate. ** **\n\n###  **Use Sanctions Screening Technology**\n\nHere is a fact: Sanctions lists are fluid. They are constantly updated\n(hourly) as data changes. And new sanctions are announced almost daily,\nreacting to the ever-changing geopolitical landscape. Using sanctions\nscreening technology, such as sanctions.io's smart AI-powered sanctions\ndatabase, significantly helps businesses stay compliant 24/7.\n\n###  **Use the Best Sanctions Databases**\n\nNot all sanctions databases are made equal. Technology-driven sanctions\nscreening services will offer a comprehensive global sanctions lists screening\nservice as part of a standard package. For example, sanctions.io's standard\npackage covers **30+ sanctions and criminal watchlists**.\n\nIt's the industry standard for screening sanctions lists and criminal\nwatchlists together. The standard package offered by sanctions.io **includes**\nFBI and Interpol watchlists. If a specific sanctions list is not covered, we\ncan add it without any additional cost to our client.\n\nSanctions screening services may also offer Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)\nscreening databases - such as sanctions.io. You can learn more about it in our\narticle covering the best practices for PEP screening.\n\n###  **Use Sanctions Screening Automation Tools**\n\nCompanies seek sanctions screening solutions that are **frictionless** to the\nbusiness. Understanding how sanctions screening providers can support\nscreening automation is always best practice. The next step is putting it into\naction.\n\nThe results are incredible when businesses implement an **effective automated\nsanctions screening process**. How? Because using tools such as APIs and\nautomated batch screening means the daily job is simply checking and examining\nthe matches (red flags).\n\n###  **Integrate Sanctions Screening with CRM Tools**\n\nAn increasingly standard best practice in the world of sanctions screening is\nthis: Integrating sanctions screening with CRM tools. And it makes complete\nsense. After all, protecting your business from sanctions violations by\nidentifying individuals or other entities in the sales stage **before any\ntransaction occurs** is a no-brainer.\n\nOur sanctions screening solutions integrate with popular CRM tools such as\nHubspot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, and more (no-coding necessary). You can learn\nmore about it here: Integrating sanctions.io with Salesforce, Pipedrive,\nHubSpot & More CRM systems.\n\n###  **Red Flags? Know What Actions To Take**\n\nA red flag is when information (e.g., a customer) matches an individual or\nentity on a sanctions list. Larger companies, especially from regulated\nsectors, will clearly understand the required actions. However, smaller\nbusinesses and start-ups without qualified AML compliance officers - and\nexperience - may wonder this: What next?\n\nIt's best practice for all companies utilizing sanctions screening services to\nhave a process for dealing with red flags. This will depend on the\njurisdictions in which the business operates (e.g., where to report it).\nSeeking local expert AML compliance advice is essential in this step.\n\n _However, the first step in all cases is to seek further information about\nthe red flag and ensure the match is not a_ ** _false positive_**.\n\n##  **How sanctions.io Can Help Your Sanctions Screening Needs**\n\nFor businesses and organizations with previous sanctions screening experience,\nyou are welcome to sign-up right now to sanctions.io's solutions on a **free\n7-day trial** **** (no credit card required).
