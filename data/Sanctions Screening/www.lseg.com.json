Overview\n  2. What is sanctions screening?\n  3. Our solution\n  4. Benefits\n\nRequest details\n\n**Sanctions are protective restrictive measures, such as an asset freeze or\nblock, investment or travel ban, financial sanctions, arms and trade\nembargoes.**\n\nThere are varying sanctions types including: explicit sanctions, where the\nsubject is named; narrative or implicit sanctions, which don\u2019t specifically\nname an individual or company but extend to entities covered by a narrative\nstatement on a sanctions programme due to their connections to the main\nsanctioned entity; and sectoral sanctions. Sanctions can be applied against\nbut not limited to a country, entity, individual, organisation and vessel.  \n\nSanctions are our highest priority and receive dedicated attention, major\nsanctions lists (OFAC, EU, UN) are monitored and covered on a 24/7/365 basis.\nWe have 500+ researchers situated in 240 countries and territories on five\ncontinents, 90+% speaking two or more languages. There are currently 57,000+\nactive sanctions records across 300+ sanction programmes as part of the World-\nCheck sanctions-screening coverage.\n\nWe monitor 10,000+ global information resource lists, 900+ sanction,\nregulatory, law enforcement lists and 5,900+ official/government sites and we\nadd 50,000+ new records monthly.\n\n##  What is sanctions screening?\n\nSanction compliance poses a challenge to organisations as not only is it an\never-changing landscape, but there is no finite sanctions list to follow and\norganisations must nevertheless ensure that they do not transact with any\nblocked entity.\n\nScreening for sanctions risk is a mandatory requirement for regulated entities\nacross all sectors and is a critical step in the know your customer or KYC\nprocess. Moreover, penalties for breaching sanctions can be severe. In 2021\nthe US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control meted out fines amounting to\nover US $20 million, 10 of the 20 penalties were levied at corporates. In 2020\nthe penalties amounted to US $23 million and only two were financial\ninstitutions.\n\nEnsuring your organisation has a robust sanctions-screening programme in place\nis essential. Access to comprehensive and accurate sanctions risk data is\ntherefore critical.\n\nOur solution\n\n##  Need help to comply with the stringent sanction regulations?\n\nOur suite of solutions provide everything you need to help you stay compliant\nin an evolving sanctions landscape.
