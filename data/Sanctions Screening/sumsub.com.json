To optimize the\nprocess, companies use AML user screening software which decreases manual\nworkload and speeds up user checks.\n\n  *  **What is sanction list and watchlist screening?**\n\nSanction list and watchlist screening is the process of checking individuals\nand entities against various databases, such as sanctions lists, politically\nexposed persons (PEP) lists, terrorist watchlists, and more. This helps\nprevent individuals or entities that may be involved in money laundering,\nterrorist financing, or other illegal activities from becoming customers. To\ndo this, businesses often use specialized AML screening software.\n\n  *  **Why do you need to perform sanctions screening?**\n\nBusinesses are required to perform sanction screening by AML regulations. The\nprocess involves checking customers through sanctions databases. Effective\nsanction screening allows businesses to prevent financial crimes by detecting\npersons who are high-risk or compromised. To automate this process, companies\nuse sanction screening software that allows them to save time and get notified\nof updates to sanction lists.\n\n  *  **Who should be screened against sanctions lists?**\n\nIn order to comply with regulations and mitigate risks, businesses need to\nscreen customers, business partners, and any other relevant parties against\nsanctions lists. This helps avoid potential involvement with individuals or\nentities involved in prohibited or restricted activities. Sanction checking\nalso allows to ensure a safe and compliant business environment.\n\n  *  **Is PEP screening mandatory?**\n\nPEP screening is not universally mandatory, but is often required by\nregulatory bodies in many sectors. Screening politically exposed persons\n(PEPs) helps identify individuals who hold influential or prominent public\npositions, reducing the risks associated with corruption, bribery, and money\nlaundering. Specific requirements may vary depending on the jurisdiction and\nindustry in which your company operates. To meet these requirements, companies\nuse automated PEP screening solutions.\n\n  *  **What is an OFAC sanctions list?**\n\nThe OFAC sanctions list refers to the individuals, entities, organizations,\nand countries that are subject to economic and trade sanctions imposed by the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The\nOFAC sanctions list includes individuals involved in terrorism, drug\ntrafficking, weapons proliferation, human rights abuses, and other illicit\nactivities. To identify such individuals, companies perform customer screening\nusing AML screening tools.\n\nPricing\n\n **Products**\n\nUser VerificationBusiness VerificationTransaction MonitoringID\nVerificationAddress VerificationVideo IdentificationAML ScreeningWorkflow\nBuilderTravel RuleNon-Doc Verification\n\nDatabase VerificationEmail/Phone VerificationBiometric VerificationDocument\nVerificationAge VerificationReusable KYCBank Card CheckCrypto\nCheckLivenessCompliance as a ServiceCustomizable Analytics\n\n **Solutions**\n\n **Industries**FintechTransportationCryptoTradingMarketplacesOnline\nGamingCarsharing\n\n **Roles**Compliance officerAnti-Fraud teamProduct manager\n\n **Resources**\n\nGuides & ReportsSuccess storiesEvents & WebinarsBlogProduct Tours\n\n **Product**Documentation API Reference Service status Release notes Supported\ndocuments\n\n**Company**\n\nAbout usNewsroomPartnersCareersSecurity &\ncomplianceTechnologiesContactsPricing\n\nSum&Substance is registered with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in line\nwith the Data Protection Act 2018.
