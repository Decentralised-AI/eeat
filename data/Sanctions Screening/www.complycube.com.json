This step is a crucial component\nof the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, which ensures thorough due diligence\nand risk mitigation.\n\nAs the sanctions landscape is ever-changing, understanding operational and\nregulatory implications is of paramount importance. This comprehensive guide\naims to provide practical insights into sanctions, the governing bodies that\nenforce them, and the sanctions screening solutions available.\n\n##  **What are Sanctions?**\n\nSanctions are tools used by countries or international organizations to impose\nrestrictions on certain activities or relations with specific regions,\nentities, or individuals. They are typically employed to address threats to\nnational security or international peace, human rights abuses, and prohibit\nillicit activity. Sanctions can take various forms, such as financial\nrestrictions, trade embargoes, and travel bans.\n\nSome of the most prominent governing and sanctioning bodies include:\n\n  *  **United Nations** (UN): The sanctions apply to all UN nation-states, encompassing a wide range of restrictions and measures.\n  *  **Office of Foreign Assets Control** (OFAC): OFAC\u2019s sanctions extend to all US citizens, individuals, and institutions conducting business within or connected to the United States and those engaged in transactions using US currency.\n  *  **European Union External Action Service** (EU EEAS): The EU EEAS sanctions affect all EU citizens and legal entities established within any of the member states.\n  *  **His Majesty\u2019s Treasury** (HMT): This body oversees the United Kingdom sanctions list, which is applicable to individuals and legal entities working or conducting activities within the territory and under UK law. The Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) enforces these sanctions.\n\n## What is a Sanctions List?\n\nA sanctions list is a publicly available document issued by national or\ninternational authorities such as the ones mentioned above. It is updated\nregularly and contains relevant details of individuals, entities, territories,\nor countries subject to economic or legal restrictions.\n\nIndividuals or parties identified on these sanctions lists may be denied\naccess to financial systems, restricted from trade, or subject to other\nlimitations as part of punitive or preventive measures.\n\n## Types of Sanctions\n\nSanctions compliance is not merely a legal obligation. It plays a crucial role\nin maintaining a secure and trustworthy business environment and prevents the\nfacilitation of illegal activities such as terrorism financing, money\nlaundering, and other financial crimes.\n\nRestrictions can be applied on different levels:\n\n  *  **Explicit sanctions** name the subject directly, be it an individual, entity, or country.\n  *  **Narrative or implicit sanctions** don\u2019t specifically name an individual or an entity. Instead, the narrative implicitly covers them due to their connections to a named sanctioned body or sector.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, sanctions can materialize into:\n\n  *  **Comprehensive sanctions:** imposing restrictions on all transactions with a specific country. Some examples include Iran, Cuba, and Sudan.\n  *  **Targeted sanctions:** limiting transactions with specific individuals, entities, or individuals listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list maintained by OFAC. Russia is a prime example.\n  *  **Sectoral sanctions:** designed to hinder the future development of specific sectors within an economy by prohibiting a specific subset of financial transactions related to those sectors.\n\n## How does Sanctions Screening Work?\n\nSanctions screening is a critical component of an effective AML/CTF program.\nIt involves checking an organization\u2019s existing and potential customers,\npartners, and transactions against global sanctions lists to identify\nfinancial risks and ensure compliance with international regulations. The\nprocess typically involves six key steps:\n\n### Step 1: Collect\n\nThe first step involves collecting necessary data that will be checked against\na sanctions list. This typically includes information about customers,\npotential business partners, and transactions. The data collected may include\nnames, addresses, dates of birth, nationality, and other pertinent details.\n\n### Step 2: Validate\n\nOnce the data is collected, it\u2019s important to corroborate the information to\nensure its accuracy. This step often involves cross-checking the data against\nother sources, such as ID documents, company registers, or third-party data\nproviders. The goal here is to ensure the integrity of the data before it is\nused in the sanctions screening process.\n\n### Step 3: Screen\n\nAfter the data has been collected and corroborated, it\u2019s time for the actual\nscreening. Using sanctions screening technology, the collected data is matched\nagainst global sanctions lists, which include individuals, organizations, or\ncountries that are embargoed or sanctioned by regulatory bodies.\n\n### Step 4: Investigate\n\nIf a potential match is identified during the sanctions screening process, it\ntriggers an investigation. The analysis aims to confirm or reject the\npotential matches upon enriching the client data and cross-checking the\ndetails. This step confirms whether the alerts were false positives or true\nmatches.\n\n### Step 5: Report\n\nReporting is the final and optional step in the sanctions screening process,\nactivated only if a true match is found. The institution must file the\nSuspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the relevant authority following the\nproper protocols, as failing to report a match can lead to severe penalties.\n\n### Step 6: Monitor\n\nAn essential, often overlooked step in the process is continuous monitoring.\nRegulations and sanctions lists are dynamic. Continuous monitoring can be done\nin real-time or periodically to ascertain compliance with ongoing due\ndiligence obligations.\n\n## When Should Sanctions Screening be Performed to Ensure Compliance?\n\nSanctions screening should be performed at several key stages to maintain\ncompliance. The initial screening has to take place when onboarding a new\nclient or partner. Before engaging in business transactions, financial\ninstitutions or businesses must verify the identities of their clients or\npartners against relevant sanctions lists. This step ensures that the entity\nor person is not barred from engaging in certain activities.\n\nHowever, performing sanctions screening and risk assessments only at the start\nof a business relationship is insufficient. It should happen regularly\nthroughout the customer relationship lifecycle. This is because sanctions\nstatuses can change over time. A customer who was not a sanctioned party\nduring onboarding or initial risk assessment might become one later.\n\n### Case Study 1: Rusal\n\nA notable example of how changes in sanctions lists can impact businesses is\nthe case of Rusal. This major aluminum producer was added to the US Department\nof Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list in April 2018 due\nto its association with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\n\nThe abrupt addition had a significant effect on global aluminum markets.\nCorporate entities around the world, involved in ongoing or future contracts\nwith Rusal found themselves needing to halt all trading activities\nimmediately. This step was necessary to comply with the new sanctions and\navoid potential fines, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring of\nsanctions lists.\n\nThe company was later delisted in early 2019 when its founder, entrepreneur\nOleg Deripaska, consented to forfeit control, lifting sanctions from the\naluminum manufacturing company. This case reaffirms that continuous monitoring\nis vital in ensuring adherence to the ever-changing sanctions landscape.\n\n## Identifying Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Their Role in Sanctions\nScreening\n\nPolitically exposed persons (PEPs) are high-risk individuals who hold a\nprominent public role or have a close association with such individuals. Due\nto their position and influence, PEPs pose a higher risk of being involved in\nbribery, corruption, money laundering, and other financial crimes.\n\nIdentifying and conducting enhanced due diligence on a politically exposed\nperson is critical to an effective sanctions screening process. Organizations\nshould have robust PEP screening controls in place to mitigate associated\nrisks. These controls should include regularly checking customer data against\nPEPs lists and transactional screening to identify suspicious activities.\n\nYou can learn more here: What is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP)?\n\n### Case Study 2: Isabel dos Santos & PwC\n\nFor instance, in 2018, Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former\npresident and identified as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), came under\nscrutiny when leaked documents suggested she exploited family connections and\npublic funds to build her $2 billion fortune. Her PEP status made her high\nrisk for banks and other institutions due to the increased chance of potential\ninvolvement in bribery or corruption.\n\nPwC, a renowned global accounting firm, found itself in hot water over its\ninvolvement with Isabel dos Santos and her financial misconduct. During the\ntime under criminal investigation, PwC had been auditing Sonangol\u2019s books,\nAngola\u2019s state-owned oil company.\n\nHowever, the firm\u2019s dual role as an advisor on a significant restructure for\nSonangol has been criticized for presenting a potential conflict of interest.\nThe auditing and advisory work by PwC took place while dos Santos, who had\nalready been identified as a PEP, served as the chair of Sonangol.\n\nDos Santos was relieved from her role shortly after her father\u2019s retirement,\nand the new management at Sonangol subsequently terminated PwC\u2019s contract\nearly, replacing it with KMPG. This case highlights the considerable risks and\npotential complications firms can face when dealing with PEPs.\n\n## The Impact of Adverse Media on Sanctions Screening\n\nAdverse media, also known as negative news, refers to information from various\nmedia sources that indicate potential sanctions risks associated with certain\ncustomers or business partners. It is a crucial component of an effective\nsanctions screening program as it can provide early warning signs of possible\nsanctions.\n\nFor instance, news about a customer\u2019s involvement in illegal activities,\nassociation with sanctioned parties, or changes in their political or business\nstatus can indicate probable threats.\n\nAdverse media screening should be performed regularly and at various stages of\nthe customer relationship lifecycle. Organizations should leverage advanced\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing\nto automate and enhance this process.\n\n## Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)\n\nSuspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are crucial in sanctions screening,\nproviding financial institutions with a means to report potential illicit\nactivities. When transactions raise suspicions of violations, institutions\nfile SARs with competent authorities. These reports facilitate investigations\nby law enforcement agencies, enabling them to take necessary actions.\n\n> According to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), financial\n> institutions in the US are experiencing a significant surge in the\n> submission of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). In 2022, the total number\n> of SARs filed exceeded 3.6 million, marking a substantial 57% increase\n> compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\n\nSARs contribute to the collective fight against money laundering, helping\nprotect the integrity of the financial system. Financial institutions avoid\nenforcement actions and assist regulatory organizations and law enforcement\nagencies in their mission by detecting and reporting suspicious activities.\n\n##  **Consequences of a Sanctions Breach**\n\nFailure to comply with AML regulations and sanctions screening requirements\ncan have severe consequences, including punitive fines, criminal proceedings,\ndamaged reputation, and sanctioning.\n\nFor instance, breaches of financial sanctions in the UK are criminal offenses\npunishable by up to 7 years in prison and monetary fines levied on individuals\nand businesses found in breach. Similarly, the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office\nof Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) considers sanctions violations a grave threat\nto national security and foreign relations. Consequently, offenders face\nmonetary fines of up to several million dollars and prison time of up to 30\nyears.\n\n> Several firms were heavily fined for OFAC breaches, in some cases exceeding\n> $1 billion. These include ZTE, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas, Cr\u00e9dit\n> Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and UniCredit.\n\nAll these consequences can seriously damage an institution\u2019s reputation,\ncredibility, and performance. Becoming a sanctioned entity can be even more\ndamaging, as it significantly hinders, if not halts, an institution\u2019s ability\nto conduct global business and access international markets and capital. In\nsome instances, these consequences led to a sanctioned institution\u2019s complete\ninability to continue operations and, ultimately, its demise.\n\nIn summary, sanctions breaches constitute serious offenses and thus have a\nsevere impact. Therefore, institutions must efficiently screen customers\nagainst relevant sanctions lists. However, as sanction lists are constantly\nupdated, it is crucial to ensure that sanctions screening processes keep up\nwith changes while avoiding inefficiencies and reducing false positives.\n\n##  **What are the Challenges Facing Sanctions Screening?**\n\nSanction Screening has never been as challenging as it is today due to several\nfactors, including:\n\n  * Sanction lists are evolving rapidly in nature (e.g., narrative sanctions) and breadth (e.g., US technology export controls).\n  * Increase in the complexity of restrictive and punitive sanction measures and screening regulations.\n  * Sanction Screening has to account for association risk, which may not be immediately apparent. For instance, the Patriot Act forbids US corporations from supplying \u2018financial assistance\u2019 to organizations accused of terrorism.\n  * Multiple sanctioning bodies have different standards and agendas that do not align, leading to inconsistent economic sanctions.\n\n> According to the data company Refinitiv, as of early 2020, there were more\n> than 34,000 explicit sanctions across more than 280 sanction programs, with\n> an increase of 62% since September 2017.\n\n##  **The Importance of Choosing the Right AML/KYC Customer and Sanctions\nScreening Partner**\n\nDespite the inherent challenges of Customer Screening, the right AML/KYC\npartner can help you implement a robust and cost-effective solution, as\noutlined below.\n\n###  **Single Customer View**\n\nSanctions Screening is only as effective as the input data used to screen the\nentity or individual at hand. Therefore, it is recommended to leverage a\nsolution that will help you streamline data collection processes and provide\nyou with a single customer view that is aggregated, consistent, and holistic.\n\n###  **Comprehensive Data Coverage**\n\nScreening activities should build on thoroughly studied and regularly revised\nglobal risk information that includes the current PEP and sanctions lists,\nunfavorable media, and compliance reports from around the world.\n\n###  **Smart Screening**\n\nNumerous vendors market fuzzy name matching as a silver bullet for state-of-\nthe-art sanctions screening. However, fuzzy name matching should not be solely\nrelied upon. It does indeed account for misspellings and minor variations.\n\nHowever, it does not deal well with **_phonetic similarity,_**\n**_transliterations_** _,_ ** _linguistic_** **_variations_** _,_ ** _non-\nLatin scripts, patronymics, honorifics, titles, or out-of-order names_ ,** to\nenumerate a few of the aspects of a reliable screening engine needs to take\ninto account. ComplyCube offers a comprehensive sanction screening solution.\n\n###  **Risk-based Approach**\n\nRisk-based approach (RBA) is a comprehensive sanctions screening solution\nshould manage several sanctions lists and allow custom thresholds and\ninclusion/exclusion rules to enable AML officers to adapt the screening\ncapability to the organization\u2019s risk perception and policies.\n\nYou can learn more about the topic here: What is a Risk-Based Approach (RBA)?\n\n###  **Case Management**\n\nAML case management, combined with monitoring and alerts, enables analysts to\ninvestigate suspicious activity and quickly mitigate financial crime risk\neffectively. A robust Case Management solution should also provide a fully\nintegrated experience with rich contextualized data, such as a detailed match\nbreakdown, and thus help investigators organize, prioritize, manage\ninvestigations, and easily discount false positives \u2013 all while creating a\npermanent audit trail for regulatory review.\n\n###  **Ongoing Due Diligence**\n\nDepending on the customer and your risk mitigation strategy, you may need to\ninclude sanctions screening monitoring and alerts. Many AML/KYC vendors can\ncheck customers in bulk via running batches. However, that is a cumbersome and\nreactive process unsuitable for the new digital age. On the other hand, mature\nKYC providers will offer ongoing monitoring to support the shift from the\ntraditional tick-the-box approach to real-time, ongoing, and proactive\ncustomer due diligence.\n\n## Why is Sanctions Screening Important for Financial Institutions?\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of finance, sanctions screening has emerged as a\nnon-negotiable requirement. At its core, it represents an integral part of the\nfinancial sanctions implementation mechanism used globally. This process is\ncritical to ensure that entities like banks and other financial institutions\ndo not engage in business transactions with individuals, organizations, or\ncountries that are on global sanctions lists.\n\nFinancial institutions worldwide implemented robust sanctions screening\nsoftware to aid their compliance efforts. The importance of sanctions\nscreening within the financial industry cannot be overstated. It\u2019s a crucial\nmeasure to mitigate the risk of engaging with sanctioned entities and to\nprevent money laundering.\n\nAs OFAC\u2019s enforcement penalties hit new records year after year, the cost of\nnon-compliance has never been higher. As such, financial services companies\nshould continually refine their sanctions screening processes and stay ahead\nof evolving global sanctions landscapes to effectively navigate this complex\nregulatory environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSanctions screening serves as an indispensable component in maintaining a\ncompliant and secure financial environment. By vigilantly cross-checking\ncustomer data against sanctions lists provided by regulatory bodies such as\nthe United Nations and the European Union, businesses can prevent transactions\nwith sanctioned parties. This proactive stance strengthens Anti-money\nLaundering (AML) efforts and contributes to the broader global initiative to\nprevent financial crime.\n\nThe world of sanctions and Anti-money Laundering compliance is continually\nevolving, and maintaining an up-to-date sanctions list at the heart of your\nscreening processes is essential to navigating this complex landscape\neffectively. Choosing the right AML/KYC and sanctions screening partner, such\nas ComplyCube, can also provide significant benefits.\n\n **Explore our global PEP and Sanctions screening** **solution** **  to learn\nmore about our platform!**\n\nTable of contents\n\nAdd a header to begin generating the table of contents\n\n### More posts\n\n  * Guides\n\n### A Robust Guide to Proof of Address Checks (PoA)\n\n  * icon-tag Identity Verification\n\nProof of Address (POA) checks are a vital part of the Know Your Customer (KYC)\nprocess alongside Proof of Identity (PoI).
