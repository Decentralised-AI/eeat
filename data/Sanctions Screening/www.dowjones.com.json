The primary goal of adding individuals or\nentities to a sanction list is to block assets and restrict trade with those\nincluded on the list.\n\nTo mitigate sanctions risk requires organizations to screen countries,\nentities, and individuals against sanction lists. To ensure accurate sanctions\nscreening, organizations must possess timely and accurate data and query every\nrelevant sanction list. They must regularly conduct screening to ensure\ncompliance and have robust processes to follow should a country, entity, or\nindividual appear on a sanctions list.\n\n### Manual and Automated Screening\n\nSanctions screening can involve manually inputting data into an online\nscreening tool or automated screening of sanctions lists using purpose-built\ntechnology. Accurate sanctions data, timely updates, and consolidated lists\ncan streamline the sanctions screening process and minimize the administrative\nburden of compliance. In addition to screening customers, technology can also\nscrutinize transactions to detect sanctioned individuals, entities, or\ncountries.\n\n### Related Terms\n\n  * #### Vessel Tracking\n\n  * #### DFAT Sanctions List\n\n  * #### Sanctions Control and Ownership Research\n\n  * English\n\n  *   *   * \n\n#### \u00a9 2023 Dow Jones\n\n  * Legal Notices\n  * Equal Opportunity\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * UK Gender Pay Gap Report\n  * Dow Jones Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Notice\n  * PIB Content Privacy Notice\n\n#### Careers\n\n  * Benefits\n  * Career Growth\n  * Our Employees\n  * View all Jobs\n\n#### Our Company\n\n  * About Us\n  * Press Room\n  * Sales & Customer Support\n\n#### Media Brands\n\n  * The Wall Street Journal\n  * Barron\u2019s\n  * MarketWatch\n  * Financial News\n\n#### Business Offerings\n\n  * Risk & Compliance\n  * Factiva\n  * Dow Jones Newswires\n  * Dow Jones Developer Platform\n\n",

The data includes content on companies and their\nbackers, identifying those that have been targeted by sanctions programs.\n\nSWIFT\u2019s Sanctions Screening service is a hosted solution to support real-time\nmessage screening against international sanctions lists. The service combines\na highly sophisticated screening engine with sanctions list management.\nTransactions can be screened against the most commonly used sanctions lists,\nincluding those from the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control,\n(OFAC), the UK\u2019s HM Treasury (HMT), the EU and the Hong Kong Monetary\nAuthority.\n\nThrough the integration of Dow Jones\u2019s Sanctions Ownership Research into\nSWIFT\u2019s Sanction Screening service, customers will be able to screen against\ncompanies and individuals considered subject to sanction by programmes\nincluding OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list and the Sectoral\nSanctions Identification (SSI) List.  Dow Jones\u2019s exhaustive and ongoing\nresearch in this area has resulted in a data set containing more than 4500\nentities from 80 different countries.\n\nSanctions regulations that impose asset freezes or specific transaction\nrestrictions extend beyond the published names of individuals and entities.\nThey specify that entities \u201cowned and controlled\u201d by sanctions targets are\nalso sanctioned. EU regulations define this as firms in which there is\nmajority ownership by someone explicitly listed in EU regulation. The US\nregulator OFAC\u2019s guidance has been even more restrictive by including firms in\nwhich aggregate ownership by multiple identified individuals or companies\ntotals 50%. Dow Jones Risk & Compliance takes this a step further, covering\nall companies sanctioned by the US, UK or EU in which a sanctions target owns\na stake of 10% or more.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to add Dow Jones Sanctions Ownership Research data to our\nSanctions Screening hosted service,\u201d said Nicolas Stuckens, Head of Sanctions\nCompliance Services, SWIFT. \u201cSanctions Screening provides a simple, cost-\neffective solution for compliance with sanctions requirements. The addition of\nhigh-quality data from Dow Jones demonstrates our commitment to delivering\nproducts and services that help our customers increase the effectiveness and\nefficiency of their financial crime compliance programmes while benefiting\nfrom standardisation and mutualised cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have our Sanctions Ownership Research complement the SWIFT\nSanctions Screening service.  As banks adapt to the changing sanctions\nlandscape, it is important for them to be on top of both the literal and\nimplied sanctioned entities. Dow Jones Sanctions Ownership Research gives\nSWIFT customers extra protection to ensure effective compliance,\u201d said Joel\nLange, Managing Director of Dow Jones Risk & Compliance.\n\nMore information on Dow Jones Risk & Compliance data solutions is available\nfrom the Dow Jones website.\n\n###\n\n**Media contacts:**\n\n**APAC**\n\nJacquelyn Drozdoff\n\nJacquelyn.drozdoff@dowjones.com\n\n+852 2831 2583\n\n\n\n**EMEA**\n\nHannah Syrocki\n\nHannah.syrocki@dowjones.com\n\n+44 207 573 4059\n\n\n\n## Search\n\n### Jobs\n\nView full result set\n\n  * Contact\n  * Legal\n  * Diversity Statement\n  * Equal Opportunity\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * Accessibility Statement\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Notice \n  * Cookie Notice \n  * Security\n  * PIB Content Privacy Notice\n  * Supplier Code of Conduct\n  *   *   *   * Sitemap \n\n  * Business Offerings\n    * Dow Jones Developer Platform\n    * News and Information\n    * Knowledge and Insight\n    * Risk and Compliance\n  * Insights\n    * Insights Archive\n  * Scoops\n    * Scoops Archive\n  * About\n    * What We Do\n    * Our Leadership Team\n    * Corporate Citizenship\n    * Our Environmental Policy\n  * Contact\n    * Get In Touch\n  * Press Room\n    * Press Releases\n  * Careers\n    * Benefits\n    * Career Growth\n    * Our Commitment\n    * Our Employees\n\n_\u00a9 Dow Jones 2023_\n\nEmail * Please fill in the required field.
