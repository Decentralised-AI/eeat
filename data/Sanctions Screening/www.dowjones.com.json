The primary goal of adding individuals or\nentities to a sanction list is to block assets and restrict trade with those\nincluded on the list.\n\nTo mitigate sanctions risk requires organizations to screen countries,\nentities, and individuals against sanction lists. To ensure accurate sanctions\nscreening, organizations must possess timely and accurate data and query every\nrelevant sanction list. They must regularly conduct screening to ensure\ncompliance and have robust processes to follow should a country, entity, or\nindividual appear on a sanctions list.\n\n### Manual and Automated Screening\n\nSanctions screening can involve manually inputting data into an online\nscreening tool or automated screening of sanctions lists using purpose-built\ntechnology. Accurate sanctions data, timely updates, and consolidated lists\ncan streamline the sanctions screening process and minimize the administrative\nburden of compliance. In addition to screening customers, technology can also\nscrutinize transactions to detect sanctioned individuals, entities, or\ncountries.\n\n### Related Terms\n\n  * #### Vessel Tracking\n\n  * #### DFAT Sanctions List\n\n  * #### Sanctions Control and Ownership Research\n\n  * English\n\n  *   *   * \n\n#### \u00a9 2023 Dow Jones\n\n  * Legal Notices\n  * Equal Opportunity\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * UK Gender Pay Gap Report\n  * Dow Jones Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Notice\n  * PIB Content Privacy Notice\n\n#### Careers\n\n  * Benefits\n  * Career Growth\n  * Our Employees\n  * View all Jobs\n\n#### Our Company\n\n  * About Us\n  * Press Room\n  * Sales & Customer Support\n\n#### Media Brands\n\n  * The Wall Street Journal\n  * Barron\u2019s\n  * MarketWatch\n  * Financial News\n\n#### Business Offerings\n\n  * Risk & Compliance\n  * Factiva\n  * Dow Jones Newswires\n  * Dow Jones Developer Platform\n\n",
