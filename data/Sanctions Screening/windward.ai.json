These lists are compiled by\ngovernments and recognized international organizations to identify individuals\nor entities subject to financial sanctions, or other restrictions, as a result\nof their actions or associations. Working with individuals or organizations\nthat appear on a sanctions watchlist can result in significant fines, or other\npenalties.\n\n## Why is sanctions screening in the maritime industry important?\n\nDue to the nature of the maritime shipping industry, vessels regularly travel\nthrough international waters and dock in multiple countries around the world.\n**Sanctions screening helps companies ensure they are compliant with\ninternational sanctions and trade restrictions.**  \n\nSanctions screening is especially important because of the potential for goods\nand individuals to be illegally transported from one country to another. This\nmeans that there is a risk that vessels, cargo, and individuals associated\nwith a shipping company could inadvertently violate sanctions, or trade\nrestrictions.\n\nReal-time sanctions screening helps lower this risk by enabling shipping\ncompanies to proactively identify and address potential violations before they\noccur. This can help protect the company from legal and reputational risks,\nand can also help prevent an organization from contributing to a global\nconflict, or supporting illicit activities.\n\nOverall, sanctions screening is an important tool for ensuring compliance with\ninternational regulations and promoting responsible business practices in the\nmaritime industry.\n\n## Compliance with maritime sanctions\n\nGovernments can impose sanctions on countries, groups, or individuals to\nprotect their interests and international law. These typically focus on human\nrights violations and financial crimes, and if a company violates these\nsanctions, it can result in significant fines, or jail time.\n\nBefore a penalty is assessed, the government or government agency will conduct\na thorough investigation into the violation. The penalty is based on the\navailable evidence, the severity of the violations, and the shipper\u2019s history\nof sanctions violations.\n\nIt is the shipping company\u2019s responsibility to check the official sanctions\nlist for any country they visit. The top international government\norganizations are:\n\n  * Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC): U.S.\n  * Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI): UK\n  * European Union \n  * United Nations \n  * Australian Maritime Safety Authority \n\nIn addition to checking with each organization and country to ensure\ncompliance, it\u2019s important to follow Know Your Vessel (KYV) guidelines and run\na thorough background check of the vessel and crew. Some of the factors to\ninvestigate include:\n\n  * Complete shipping routes \n  * Country and port where a vessel was flagged\n  * Origin and destination of goods being shipped\n  * Confirmation that individuals or organizations that appear on a sanctions watchlist won\u2019t receive the shipped items  \n  * Access to end-user certification \n\nWhile some of this data can be difficult to verify, it\u2019s the shipper\u2019s\nresponsibility to try and collect as much data as possible.\n\n## How to stay compliant and avoid sanctions\n\nStaying up to date with all the different sanctions lists worldwide can be\ndifficult. The ships and crews can come under multiple jurisdictions and must\nensure compliance with Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) measures and sanctions to\nCombat the Financing of Terrorism (CFT).\n\nThe ideal approach is to have the latest sanctions screening tools. A powerful\nAI solution can scan the top data providers, such as LexisNexis, and inspect\nreal-time behavioral data for any issues. It will flag potential sanctions\nviolations, so organizations can handle them immediately. The system scans the\nshipping vessels and companies against major lists from OFAC, OFSI, UN, and\nEU, and reports on any sanctions, issues, or dealings they\u2019ve had with\ndifferent countries.\n\nOnce the data is compiled, shippers can evaluate the risk involved with a\nspecific company, port, and vessel to ensure a high level of compliance.  \n\n## What are the best practices for following maritime sanctions screening?\n\nTo avoid vessel sanctions, it\u2019s important to have accurate real-time data of\nthe who, what, when, and where of the ship\u2019s journey. Some of the best\npractices that all companies should follow are as follows:\n\n\u2714 **Know the complete supply chain** : not only should organizations know\ntheir customer (KYC), but also know the customer\u2019s customers. This requires\ndue diligence and investigating the third-party relationships to see if alerts\nare triggered.\n\n\u2714 **Scan the grey lists** : part of the due diligence process should look\nthrough the grey list. It\u2019s a publicly available list of ships and shipping\ncompanies that were indirectly involved in any maritime sanctions violations.\n\n\u2714 **Inspect a vessel\u2019s AIS history** : every reputable shipping vessel has an\navailable Automatic Identification System (AIS) history form. It details where\nthe ship traveled and docked, which can assist with determining risk\nassessment. While there are some instances where it\u2019s acceptable for the AIS\nto be deactivated during the journey, it can also highlight an attempt to hide\ndata from the client.\n\n\u2714 **Understand the 50% rule** : the OFAC 50 percent rule blocks property and\ninterests where a sanctioned party owns, or indirectly owns, at least 50% of\nthe entity. This also includes multiple entities owning a combined 50%. For\nexample, if two people on a sanctioned list each own 25% of an entity, it is\nblocked. To avoid sanctions violations, the shipper must investigate a\ncompany\u2019s owners and partners to ensure there won\u2019t be any issues.\n\n### Organizations throughout the maritime ecosystem can proactively mitigate\nsanctions, compliance risk, and identify violations before designations occur\nwith real-time insights and fewer false positives, via the power of Maritime\nAI\u2122.\n\n## Recommended for you\n\n## The 3 Necessary Components to Subdue Spoofing\n\nDo you want the three necessary components to detect location (GNSS)\nmanipulation (aka \u201cspoofing\u201d)?
