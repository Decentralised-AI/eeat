We are here to help you timely identify such potential risks.\n\nCopy link Link copied to clipboard\n\n#### Why sanction screening is important?\n\nGovernments and international bodies are often quick to crack down on\ncompanies that work with a sanctioned third-party (legal entity or\nindividual). And the span of potential adverse consequences might be dramatic,\ni.a.: heavy fines, reputational damage and even a ban from responding to\npublic tenders are just some of the repercussions you may encounter.\n\nHaving on the fly clarity and confidence on the sanctions imposed on your\ncounterparts is crucial to help you timely highlight the related risks.\n\n## How can we help?\n\nWe recognize that the sanctions landscape is continuously evolving and is\nbecoming even more and more complex than ever before.\n\nOur dedicated forensic team has all the necessary data sources and tools for\nconducting sanctions\u2019 and watch lists\u2019 screening across multiple\njurisdictions. Right here and right now. No need to spend your time on hectic\nchecks through numerous sanction lists and chasing their continuous updates.\n\n#### Our approach\n\nWe discuss and agree on the set of sanctions lists for the screening with you.\n\nWe engage our trusted external data provider to pull together the list of\nsanctioned entities (including their associated entities*) at the exact time\nand date.\n\nWe use an algorithm and match the list of third parties provided by you with\nthe list of the sanctioned entities.\n\nWe perform manual review of a selected ratio of identified matches for\npotential false positives based on additional information from publicly\navailable sources and provided by you.\n\n*Associated entity is an individual or a company that is related to family members or associates of sanctioned entities, branches and operational units of sanctioned banks, entities that are owned or controlled by sanctioned entities.  \n\n#### Choose your package\n\n### Starter\n\nUp to 100 checks\n\n### Light\n\nUp to 500 checks\n\n### Extended\n\nUp to 1000 checks\n\n### Enterprise\n\nMore than 1000 checks\n\n< Back\n\n####\n\n< Back\n\n[+] Read More\n\nEach package is valid for 365 days from the date of purchase. The checks can\nbe used for initial screening as well as re-screening.\n\n## What do we specialise in?\n\n  * Integrity Due Diligence\n  * Pre-employment screening\n  * Sanctions screening\n\n#### Integrity Due Diligence  \n\nThe adverse impact of doing business with unreliable person or company can be\nhuge and may impact its brand and reputation. Providing you with a better\nunderstanding and clarity of the background, management track record, business\npractices and activities of the third parties with whom your Organisation\ninteracts, we help to identify potential red flags. Through Integrity Due\nDiligence we help Organisations to take more informed strategic and management\ndecisions.\n\n#### Pre-employment screening\n\nPeople are in heart of every Organisation. Finding the right candidate or\ncreating a talent pool for key positions is an important process that we can\nhelp make more reliable.\n\nWe conduct background checks on potential employees including their social\nmedia activity, verification of their CVs, review of their biographical\nprofiles and reputation. In addition, through direct inquiries we conduct\nverification of candidate\u2019s educational background, employment history and\nobtained certifications.\n\nThus, we help both to better understand whom you are considering to employ as\nwell as gain additional insights for a more considerate management decision\nmaking in this regard.\n\n#### Sanctions screening\n\nRelationships with any sanctioned or blacklisted business-partner may\nadversely impact reptation, sustainability and performance of your\norganisation. We recognize that the sanctions landscape is continuously\nevolving and is becoming more and more challenging and complex than ever\nbefore.\n\nOur dedicated forensic team has all the necessary data sources and tools for\nconducting sanctions\u2019 and watch lists\u2019 screening across multiple\njurisdictions. Right here and right now. No need to spend your time on hectic\nchecks through numerous sanction lists and chasing their frequent and ad-hoc\nupdates.\n\n## Our insights\n\n### Damages in commercial arbitration: Trends in international arbitration\ndamages awards\n\nHow wide is the gap in assessing loss between claimants and respondents?
