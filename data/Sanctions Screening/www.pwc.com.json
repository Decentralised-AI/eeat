We are here to help you timely identify such potential risks.\n\nCopy link Link copied to clipboard\n\n#### Why sanction screening is important?\n\nGovernments and international bodies are often quick to crack down on\ncompanies that work with a sanctioned third-party (legal entity or\nindividual). And the span of potential adverse consequences might be dramatic,\ni.a.: heavy fines, reputational damage and even a ban from responding to\npublic tenders are just some of the repercussions you may encounter.\n\nHaving on the fly clarity and confidence on the sanctions imposed on your\ncounterparts is crucial to help you timely highlight the related risks.\n\n## How can we help?\n\nWe recognize that the sanctions landscape is continuously evolving and is\nbecoming even more and more complex than ever before.\n\nOur dedicated forensic team has all the necessary data sources and tools for\nconducting sanctions\u2019 and watch lists\u2019 screening across multiple\njurisdictions. Right here and right now. No need to spend your time on hectic\nchecks through numerous sanction lists and chasing their continuous updates.\n\n#### Our approach\n\nWe discuss and agree on the set of sanctions lists for the screening with you.\n\nWe engage our trusted external data provider to pull together the list of\nsanctioned entities (including their associated entities*) at the exact time\nand date.\n\nWe use an algorithm and match the list of third parties provided by you with\nthe list of the sanctioned entities.\n\nWe perform manual review of a selected ratio of identified matches for\npotential false positives based on additional information from publicly\navailable sources and provided by you.\n\n*Associated entity is an individual or a company that is related to family members or associates of sanctioned entities, branches and operational units of sanctioned banks, entities that are owned or controlled by sanctioned entities.  \n\n#### Choose your package\n\n### Starter\n\nUp to 100 checks\n\n### Light\n\nUp to 500 checks\n\n### Extended\n\nUp to 1000 checks\n\n### Enterprise\n\nMore than 1000 checks\n\n< Back\n\n####\n\n< Back\n\n[+] Read More\n\nEach package is valid for 365 days from the date of purchase. The checks can\nbe used for initial screening as well as re-screening.\n\n## What do we specialise in?\n\n  * Integrity Due Diligence\n  * Pre-employment screening\n  * Sanctions screening\n\n#### Integrity Due Diligence  \n\nThe adverse impact of doing business with unreliable person or company can be\nhuge and may impact its brand and reputation. Providing you with a better\nunderstanding and clarity of the background, management track record, business\npractices and activities of the third parties with whom your Organisation\ninteracts, we help to identify potential red flags. Through Integrity Due\nDiligence we help Organisations to take more informed strategic and management\ndecisions.\n\n#### Pre-employment screening\n\nPeople are in heart of every Organisation. Finding the right candidate or\ncreating a talent pool for key positions is an important process that we can\nhelp make more reliable.\n\nWe conduct background checks on potential employees including their social\nmedia activity, verification of their CVs, review of their biographical\nprofiles and reputation. In addition, through direct inquiries we conduct\nverification of candidate\u2019s educational background, employment history and\nobtained certifications.\n\nThus, we help both to better understand whom you are considering to employ as\nwell as gain additional insights for a more considerate management decision\nmaking in this regard.\n\n#### Sanctions screening\n\nRelationships with any sanctioned or blacklisted business-partner may\nadversely impact reptation, sustainability and performance of your\norganisation. We recognize that the sanctions landscape is continuously\nevolving and is becoming more and more challenging and complex than ever\nbefore.\n\nOur dedicated forensic team has all the necessary data sources and tools for\nconducting sanctions\u2019 and watch lists\u2019 screening across multiple\njurisdictions.

instruments: Current challenges\nand automated solutions\n\nCopy link Link copied to clipboard\n\n## Overview\n\nFinancial institutions continue to face compliance challenges due to increased\nregulations, growing businesses and ongoing inefficiency mitigation. Anti-\nmoney laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance demand quick and proactive\nadaptation of processes in order to stay ahead of the curve. Chief challenges\nfor financial institutions include navigating highly manual tasks such as\nalert reviews and clearance and paper instrument transaction processing.\n\nMany tools have been developed in an effort to mitigate inefficiencies and\navoid potential billions in fines for violations of US economic sanctions.\nSolutions such as optical character recognition (OCR), native language\nprocessing (NLP), robotic process automation (RPA), AI and machine learning\nare at the forefront of technologies in transaction processing efficiency,\nrisk mitigation and savings in overall workforce costs. However, the\ncomplexity and sophistication of these tools require correct implementation.\n\n## The challenges with paper screening\n\nTraditional methods of screening simply cannot keep pace with modern business\ndemands. The manual nature of processing paper instruments paired with the\nsheer volume of transactions creates limitless potential for error because\ndata extraction and analysis, screening alert review and record keeping are\ncomplex. Current challenges include:\n\n**Data extraction and analysis**\n\n  * Data manipulation challenges due to complex procedures\n  * Increased risk of incorrect or incomplete data\n\n**Screening and alert review**\n\n  * Data entry errors impacting filters and effectiveness\n  * High numbers of false positives and duplicates due to screening irrelevant data\n\n**Quality assurance and audit**\n\n  * Slowly generated, fragmented, paper-based audit trails\n  * Limited and manual controls\n\n## The benefits of moving to automated solutions\n\nDespite increasing regulatory scrutiny and sanctions risk exposure, many\nfinancial institutions are still using outdated technologies and inefficient\nmanual processes that result in inaccurate results. In order to remediate\nthese inefficiencies, financial institutions should integrate automated\nsolutions into their current technology infrastructure.\n\n**Financial institutions that adopt new, automated technologies can reap a\nnumber of benefits, including:**\n\n  * Ability to quickly and proactively adapt to increased volumes and regulatory expectations\n  * Increased efficiency of end-to-end processing with more automated data transformation downstream and the reduction of manual data entry\n  * Higher percentage of productive alerts captured by screening systems utilizing more accurate data\n  * Potential resource and operating cost savings by automating processes such as data extraction, manipulation and analysis\n\n##  Download Challenges with paper screening: Transforming sanctions screening\nfor paper instruments\n\n## Automated solutions that can help alleviate paper screening challenges\n\n  1. Data extraction and analysis\n  2. Screening and alert reviews\n  3. Quality assurance and audit trail\n\n### Data extraction and analysis\n\n**Optical character recognition (OCR)**\n\nOCR is a process that electronically converts text by singling out specific\ncharacters from a scan or an image of a paper instrument. The extracted\ncharacters are then rebuilt into specified fields within the end system. OCR\ncan be designed to accommodate different formats of text (i.e., handwritten or\nprinted) and adapt to different scripts.\n\n**Text analytics and natural language processing (NLP)**\n\nAdvanced text analytics and NLP are artificial intelligence techniques that\ncan be used to discover relevant information in text and transform it into\ndata. In the context of paper screening, this technique can be used to replace\nmanual paper instrument analysis and extraction procedures (e.g., classifying\nand selecting names and places from documents).\n\n### Screening and alert reviews\n\n**Robotic process automation (RPA)**\n\nRPA platforms mimic the repetitive, labor-intensive, individual actions and\nprocess steps that are made by humans. RPA can be used to automate the online\nscreening process in which an analyst must enter information into relevant\nfields for screening. In addition, evidence gathering can be automated, using\nuniversal matching from internal or external sources for analyst consideration\nduring alert reviews, thereby reducing the time spent on collecting and\nconsolidating research.\n\n**Intelligent process automation (IPA)**\n\nPost-alert generation, machine learning and IPA solutions can be applied to\nthe alerts based on client, payment and list information and external\ninformation to eliminate alerts based on pre-defined rules and disposition\nhistory. Automated match resolution techniques can reduce the quantity of\nfalse positives that would require further investigation.\n\n### Quality assurance and audit trail\n\n**Workflow and  case management**\n\nWhile workflow and case management solutions are not new, they are not always\nadequately used to facilitate trade processing, alert management, and quality\ncontrols throughout the process. Workflow solutions can be customized to meet\nspecific requirements surrounding supporting evidence, and approvals can be\nattached to a case to provide an end-to-end audit trail.\n\n## Implementing automated solutions for paper screening\n\nIntegrating new technologies for paper instruments into an existing sanctions\nscreening program is becoming increasingly necessary for financial\ninstitutions facing rising costs associated with compliance and demand for\nenhanced controls. As financial institutions continue to deal with higher\ntransaction volumes and shorter processing times, it is important to\nunderstand and consider how new solutions can positively impact and reduce the\nrisk of misaligned paper screening processes.\n\nWhen it comes to innovating and automating screening processes, financial\ninstitutions will need to determine which automation opportunities are most\npertinent, given their current processes, operations and risk appetite.\n\n##### **Key steps to consider when implementing automated solutions:**\n\n  * Conduct an in-depth analysis of the current paper instrument management and screening process to understand capabilities, limitations and automation opportunities\n  * Define the future process, including target architecture and requirements for each improvement area\n  * Define a baseline risk tolerance to evaluate the automated solution against acceptable risk factors\n  * Choose a qualified vendor through the RFP or vendor selection process and conduct proofs-of-concept, leveraging well-defined use cases\n  * Implement and integrate automation tools based on the defined requirements\n  * Conduct tuning, if applicable, of the automated solutions to ensure they are in line with the financial institution's risk tolerance and monitor solution performance over time\n  * Validate the implementation of the solutions (internally or externally), and identify gaps or improvement opportunities following industry standards and regulatory expectations\n\n## How PwC can help\n\nOur Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) brings together the full breadth of PwC\u2019s\ntechnology, regulatory and investigative experience with the work of over\n2,000 global financial crimes professionals in cybersecurity, anti-money\nlaundering, sanctions, fraud, anti-bribery and anti-corruption.
