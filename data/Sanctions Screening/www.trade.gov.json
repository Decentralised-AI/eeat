Consolidated Screening List\n\nConsolidated Screening List\n\nScreen potential buyers and end-users to comply with U.S. Government\nregulations.\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailCopy Link\n\n# Consolidated Screening List\n\nUse the Consolidated Screening List Search Engine.\n\nThe Consolidated Screening List (CSL) is a list of parties for which the\nUnited States Government maintains restrictions on certain exports, reexports,\nor transfers of items. Below, under \u201cTools\u201d are links to the CSL search\nengine, downloadable CSL files, and the CSL Application Programming Interface\n(API), all consisting of the consolidation of multiple export screening lists\nof the Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury.\n\nLearn more about recent Russia sanctions and other export control updates.\n\n### **Key Considerations:**\n\n  * These tools are a consolidation of multiple export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State, and the Treasury and may be used as an aid to industry in conducting electronic screens of potential parties to regulated transactions. \n  * In the event that a company, entity, or person on the list appears to match a party potentially involved in your export transaction, additional due diligence should be conducted before proceeding. \n  * There may be a strict export prohibition, requirement for seeking a license application, evaluation of the end-use or user to ensure it does not result in an activity prohibited by any U.S. export regulations, or other restriction. \n  * Prior to taking further action, to ensure full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the restrictions placed on the parties on this list, the user must check the official publication of restricted parties in the Federal Register. They should also check the official lists of restricted parties maintained on the websites of the Departments of Commerce, State, and the Treasury. \n\nThe links below, under \u201cSources\u201d will connect you to the specific webpage\nwhere additional information about how to use each specific list is contained.\nThese links are also embedded into the CSL search engine and CSL downloadable\nfiles. You will find them in the column \u201csource_information_url\u201d for each\nlisted entity.\n\n**Updates  **\n\nAll the tools are updated automatically every day at 5:00 AM EST/EDT. The CSL\npulls updates of the lists detailed below from each of the sourcing federal\nagencies. It is the responsibility of the federal agency to make available\nupdated file(s) in order for the CSL to be up-to-date.  \n  \nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL UPDATES TO THE CONSOLIDATED SCREENING LIST\n\n**Tools  **\n\n**CSL Search Engine**\n\nThe CSL Search Engine works with the CSL API to allow users to type in a name,\ncountry, or source agency in the search. (Best viewed in Chrome and Firefox).\n\nThe CSL search engine has \u201cFuzzy Name Search\u201d capabilities, allowing a search\nwithout knowing the exact spelling of an entity\u2019s name. In Fuzzy Name mode,\nthe CSL returns a \u201cscore\u201d for results that exactly or nearly match the\nsearched name. This is particularly helpful when searching on CSL for names\nthat have been translated into English from non-Latin alphabet languages.\n\n**CSL Downloadable Files**\n\nIn the CSL downloadable files, there is a column which is titled \u201csource.\u201d\nThis column indicates which specific federal agency\u2019s proscribed party\nscreening list is the source for each entry on the spreadsheet. Blank data\nfields in the CSL downloadable file are not applicable to the consolidated\nscreening list in the \u201csource\u201d column.\n\n  * Instructions for Downloading the Consolidated Screening List \n  * CSV Download \n  * TSV Download (ASCII encoded)   \n  * JSON                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n**CSL Application Programming Interface (API)  **\n\nThe CSL API enables computers to freely access the CSL in an open, machine-\nreadable format. From this API, any company can build a search engine to\nquickly find names, aliases, and other screening information. The API has\n\u201cFuzzy Name Search\u201d capabilities as well.  \n\nSee also: API Getting Started Guide\n\n### **Key Sources  **\n\n**Department of Commerce \u2013 Bureau of Industry and Security  **\n\n  * Denied Persons List \\- Individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges.
