It seems that the pricing and plans for sanctions screening services are not readily available for the majority of the listed providers. However, I can provide a general comparison of the features and pricing models typically offered by such services.

Sanctions screening services typically offer the following features:

1. Database Access: Access to comprehensive databases of individuals, entities, and vessels that are subject to sanctions or watchlists.

2. Real-time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of sanctions lists to ensure that any new or updated entries are promptly identified.

3. Customizable Rules: The ability to configure screening rules based on specific risk profiles and regulatory requirements.

4. Integration: Seamless integration with existing compliance and risk management systems through APIs or other methods.

5. Reporting and Audit Trails: Detailed reporting capabilities and audit trails to demonstrate compliance with screening requirements.

When it comes to pricing, providers may offer different models such as:

1. Subscription-based: A recurring fee based on the level of usage or the number of screenings conducted.

2. Transaction-based: Pay-per-use pricing model where the cost is determined by the volume of screenings.

3. Enterprise-level: Tailored pricing for large organizations with specific needs and high screening volumes.

Given the lack of specific pricing information for the listed providers, it's challenging to provide a direct comparison. However, I can offer a hypothetical comparison table based on common pricing models and features:

| Provider | Database Access | Real-time Monitoring | Customizable Rules | Integration | Pricing Model |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Provider A | Comprehensive | Yes | Yes | API Integration | Subscription-based |
| Provider B | Extensive | Yes | Yes | Customizable | Transaction-based |
| Provider C | Extensive | Yes | Yes | Seamless Integration | Enterprise-level |

Please note that the above comparison is purely hypothetical and based on common industry practices. For accurate pricing and plan details, it's recommended to directly contact the providers or consult their official websites.
