Sanction lists are often\ncollated by governments or international bodies such as the European Union.\n\n## Managing SANCTIONS RISK has never been so complex\n\n### **Sanctions lists are evolving constantly**\n\nAs governments increasingly rely on sanctions as a tool for political foreign\npolicy, new entities are added to, and removed from sanctions lists, all of\nthe time. Over the past 5 years, the average number of designated entities has\nincreased significantly.\n\n### **The nature of sanctions is becoming more complex**\n\nWhereas they previously targeted only specific named entities (states, ships,\naircraft, organisations and individuals), now narrative and sectoral sanctions\nhave been introduced targeting specific sectors and prohibiting specific\nactivities, which are more open to interpretation.\n\n### **Sanctions aren\u2019t limited to the entities themselves**\n\nOrganisations owned or controlled by sanctioned entities also need to be in\nscope of sanctions lists and compliance programmes. Additionally, customers\nwho aren\u2019t on a sanctions list but have a relationship with a sanctioned\nentity could also present a risk.\n\n### **There are multiple sanctioning bodies with their own sanctions lists**\n\nThe multitude of sanctioning bodies, including sovereign states, regional\nunions and international organisations such as the UN, each publish their own\nsanctions \u2013 which don\u2019t always align.\n\n## Who are the relevant SANCTIONING BODIES?\n\nFor UK businesses, the most relevant sanctioning bodies include the European\nUnion, HM Treasury, US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the UN\nSecurity Council. Beyond these, companies may also need to consider other\nsanctioning bodies depending on the territories in which they trade, the\ncurrencies they trade in, and their partnerships and alliances.\n\n### **HM Treasury Sanctions List**\n\nThe UK consolidated list of financial sanctions targets applies to:\n\n  * all individuals and legal entities who are within or undertake activities within the UK\u2019s territory\n  * all UK nationals and legal entities established under UK law, including their branches (irrespective of where their activities take place)\n\nOffice for Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is responsible for\nensuring UK sanctions are implemented and enforced.\n\n### **OFAC Sanctions List**\n\nThe specially designated nationals and blocked persons list (SDN) applies to:\n\n  * all US citizens, wherever they are in the world \n  * corporate entities constituted in the US\n  * any entity that:\n    * trades in US dollars \n    * uses US goods or components\n    * has a US parent, subsidiary or affiliate\n    * and/or work through a local agent or supplier with a US connection\n\n### **EU Consolidated List of Sanctions**\n\nThe EU consolidated list of sanctions applies to:\n\n  * all EU citizens, wherever they are located in the world\n  * corporate entities constituted in a member state\n\n### **UN Sanctions**\n\nThe United Nations Security Council sanctions list applies to:\n\n  * all UN Nation states\n\n## Which companies and industry sectors NEED to screen for sanctions?\n\nAll businesses in all sectors are obliged to comply with sanctions screening\nrequirements, and therefore need to have adequate controls in place.\nHistorically, enforcement actions have been more prominent in Financial\nServices, but other sectors have also received significant fines and some\nregulatory bodies are increasingly turning their attention to other\nindustries. For example, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation\n(OFSI) has published financial sanctions guidance for charities and non-\ngovernmental organisations. Failure to comply with sanctions or obtain the\ncorrect licence, in the case of export controls, can lead to significant\nfines. In 2022 alone, U.S OFAC\u2019s enforcement penalties hit a record of $42\nmillion. View this guide to U.S. OFAC sanctions for more detail on whether\nyour business is in scope and how not to breach OFAC sanctions.\n\n### **It\u2019s not just customers who present sanctions risk\u2026**\n\nEnforcement agencies can levy fines not just for sanctions violations, but\nalso failure to have adequate controls in place. This means firms must ensure\nthat they carry out effective sanctions screening, not only on direct third\nparties, but also their associates, beneficial owners and the extended supply\nchain, particularly in geographies known to have strong links to sanctioned\ncountries.\n\n## HOW does sanctions screening work?\n\nSanctions screening involves screening individuals, groups or companies\nagainst designated sanction lists according to the territories in which an\norganisation trades, the currencies they trade in, and their partnerships and\nalliances. This can take the form of manually inputting a name into an online\nsearch tool, checking a customer database for any sanctions alerts en masse,\nor automatically screening customer and stakeholder databases regularly.\n\n## WHEN should sanctions screening be performed to ensure sanctions\ncompliance?\n\nCompanies need to be able to keep pace with the ever-changing sanctions\nlandscape to stay compliant. To manage sanctions risk effectively,\norganisations need to screen their customers (both existing and new) and\npayment transactions against multiple sanctions lists, which can be a\nchallenge, particularly where volumes are high.\n\nSanctions screening should be a top priority after the initial risk assessment\nwhen onboarding a customer or third party. In addition, companies should\nensure existing customers and third parties are screened on a regular basis to\nmaintain compliance against the dynamic and ever-changing financial and trade\nsanctions landscape. Possible matches should be addressed urgently, with\nclearly defined processes for escalation. All firms must have clearly defined\nsenior management responsibility for sanctions compliance, since regulatory\nauthorities are now applying much deeper levels of scrutiny to controls and\nprocedures, than ever before.\n\n## Sanctions screening CHALLENGES\n\nThe real challenge for many companies is not just to detect customers who are\non sanctions lists and prevent them from transacting with the business, but\nalso to avoid disrupting the customer journey for legitimate customers and\nundermining the efficiency of the company\u2019s operations.\n\n### **Key challenges include:**\n\n### **Under or over screening**\n\nIf organisations do not screen robustly, there is a danger of \u2018false\nnegatives\u2019, where entities subject to sanctions slip through the net.\n\nConversely, over-screening can result in organisations generating high volumes\nof \u2018false positives\u2019, where non-sanctioned entities are flagged as potentially\nsanctioned. These false positives need time and resource to remediate to\nconfirm they are not sanctioned.\n\nA screening engine must be capable of precision tuning to reflect the\ncompany\u2019s risk exposure and screening rules, as well as being able to deal\nwith imprecise or inaccurate data. Machine learning technology can be used to\nautomate the routine elimination of false positives.\n\n### **Equivalence**\n\nWhilst previously commonplace, relying on a third party for sanctions\ncompliance or \u2018equivalence\u2019 is no longer acceptable.\n\nFor example, banks historically relied on the sanctions screening controls of\ntheir correspondent banks for mutual customers. Firms should seek the advice\nof their professional advisers, where appropriate.\n\n### **Divergence**\n\nIn certain cases, the economic sanctions applied by different bodies are\ninconsistent. For example following the Russian invasion of Ukraine there was\nan international surge in sanctions applied to prominent Russian individuals\nand organisations. However, not all sanctioning bodies were aligned or even\nagreed on which entities should be designated.\n\nWhen transacting with an entity sanctioned by one body but not another, you\nshould exhibit extra caution and implement additional controls.\n\n## TOP TIPS for effective sanctions screening\n\n**1**\n\n### **Prepare your customer data well**\n\nFinancial crime compliance costs have escalated, requiring greater focus on\noperational efficiency in KYC/AML. Streamlining data acquisition processes,\ncreating common data lakes and investing in enriching customer and third party\ndata, are highly recommended.\n\n**2**\n\n### **Use proven, reliable technology to support sanctions screening**\n\nSolutions should be capable of handling multiple lists, batch screening, and\nbe able to set up predefined searches tailored to an organisations risk\nexposure and policies.\n\n**3**\n\n### **Screen against high quality and comprehensive sanctions data**\n\nScreening activities should draw from extensively researched and continuously\nupdated global risk information incorporating the latest PEP and sanctions\nlists, adverse media and enforcement records from around the world.\n\n**Sanctions Screening Tip 1:**\n\n## Prepare your CUSTOMER DATA well\n\nIt\u2019s critical that customer data is up-to-date and it\u2019s worth investing time,\nupfront, to cleanse and prepare data. Incomplete or inaccurate data will\nresult in false positives and when companies are screening millions of\ncustomers daily, this can become a real problem.\n\nWhere possible, it is prudent to use data enrichment software to append\nsecondary identifiers, such as date of birth, address and nationality for\nindividuals, or business address and registration number for companies. This\nwill help screening platforms to focus results and will greatly improve\nprocess efficiency, saving time in unnecessary remediation, which can take up\nto 18 hours for a single match.*\n\n##### * Time taken to remediate an average sanctions match as reported by over\n150 financial services professionals in \u2018KYC and Sanctions Remediation: The\nImpact of Inefficiency\u2019 \u2013 a LexisNexis\u00ae Risk Solutions report.\n\n**Sanctions Screening Tip 2:**\n\n## Use proven, reliable TECHNOLOGY to support screening\n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure that the sanctions screening software you use to\nsupport your screening is fit for purpose. Here are some of the key\nconsiderations you should take into account:\n\n### **Capacity to handle high volumes and to scale for business growth**\n\nThe sanctions screening software you use to support your sanctions checks has\nto be both stable and scalable, enabling you to screen the volumes of customer\nand transactions that your business requires. For many companies, this will\namount to millions of records daily.\n\nDoes your technology provider have the resource and infrastructure to ensure\nyour screening and onboarding systems are operationally resilient in the long\nterm?\n\n### **User-friendly with customisable settings**\n\nThe technology platform should be easy to use and offer configurable risk-\nbased settings, so that you can avoid over-screening and adjust screening\ncriteria to match your organisation\u2019s risk appetite.\n\nThe platform should also have workflow tools to manage the remediation of\nsanctions matches in a logical fashion.\n\n### **Proven functionality and the ability to automate**\n\nHaving industry-proven functionality and the ability to automate tasks is\nvital, as this will help ensure the process is effortless and efficient all\nthe way through from the initial loading of files, through to the results.\n\n  * Capabilities such as fuzzy logic matching will increase effectiveness and help avoid false negatives.\n  * An \u2018accept list\u2019 function is critical, so that once customers are cleared by screening, they will not be re-screened unless the data on their file changes in some way. This is particularly important when volumes of records are high, as it avoids the needless re-screening of records which have seen no change.\n  * Date stamp functionality ensures that any searches have an audit trail, evidencing for both regulators and internal stakeholders that adequate procedures have been followed.\n\n**Sanctions Screening Tip 3:**\n\n## Screen against high quality and COMPREHENSIVE sanctions data\n\nTo ensure you are identifying sanctions from all relevant bodies, the data you\nscreen your customers against must be comprehensive and up-to-date and,\nideally, consolidated all in one place with other watchlist databases such as\npolitically exposed person lists.\n\nSome businesses rely on search engines to locate such information, but this is\ninefficient and could leave your organisation exposed to sanctions breaches\nand reputational risk.\n\n### **For full confidence in your compliance, your data sources should:**\n\n### **Be curated by a global network of experts**\n\nFull coverage of global sanctioning bodies requires multi-lingual research\nexperts around the world to collate the information on a 24/7 basis.\n\nWhilst the data within sanctions listings must be returned as originally\npublished, the best researchers will add value by providing additional\ncontextual information. The same research can also apply to politically\nexposed persons to ensure profiles are fully substantiated. What is a PEP?\n\n### **Offer a consolidated view of global sanctions lists**\n\nAn individual or business could be listed on any number of the multitude of\nsanctions lists. Consolidating all associated sanctions listings into a single\nview could improve efficiencies, and help avoid missing any sanctions.\n\nConversely, screening against data taken solely from the relevant authority\nmay be more efficient \u2013 consider whether your data source offers both options.\n\n### **Optimise sanctions records**\n\nSanctions lists come in a variety of formats and sizes. Being able to view\nthem in a standardised fashion, whilst retaining the original data as\npublished, can enhance the sanctions review process.\n\n### **Add and update sanctions lists as soon as possible**\n\nSanctions listings are always changing, with new sanctions being added and\nexisting ones amended or retracted. Being aware of change at the earliest\npossible opportunity following a sanctions notice, is critical.\n\n##  LexisNexis\u00ae Risk Solutions can help you successfully manage sanctions risk\n\n###
