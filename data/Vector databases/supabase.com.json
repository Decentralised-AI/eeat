Incredibly easy to set up, great documentation, and so many fewer\nhoops to jump through than the competition. I definitely plan to use it on any\nand all future projects.\"\n\n@IxoyeDesign\n\n\"@supabase is just \ud83e\udd2f Now I see why a lot of people love using it as a backend\nfor their applications. I am really impressed with how easy it is to set up an\nAuth and then just code it together for the frontend. @IngoKpp now I see your\njoy with Supabase #coding #fullstackwebdev\"\n\n@varlenneto\n\n\"I've been using @supabase for two personal projects and it has been amazing\nbeing able to use the power of Postgres and don't have to worry about the\nbackend\"\n\n@justinjunodev\n\n\"Y'all @supabase + @nextjs is amazing! \ud83d\ude4c Barely an hour into a proof-of-\nconcept and already have most of the functionality in place. \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\"\n\n@BraydonCoyer\n\n\"And thanks to @supabase, I was able to go from idea to launched feature in a\nmatter of hours. Absolutely amazing!\"\n\n@damlakoksal\n\n\"Contributing to open-source projects and seeing merged PRs gives enormous\nhappiness! Special thanks to @supabase, for giving this opportunity by staying\nopen-source and being junior-friendly\u270c\ud83c\udffc\"\n\n@KenTheRogers\n\n\"Holy crap. @supabase is absolutely incredible. Most elegant backend as a\nservice I've ever used. This is a dream.\"\n\n@kevcodez\n\n\"Over the course of a few weeks, we migrated 125.000 users (email/pw, Gmail,\nFacebook, Apple logins) from Auth0 to @supabase and have now completed the\nmigration. I'm just glad the migration is done \ud83d\ude05 Went well, besides a few edge\ncases (duplicate emails/linked accounts)\"\n\n@PaoloRicciuti\n\n\"Using @supabase I'm really pleased on the power of postgres (and sql in\ngeneral). Despite being a bit dubious about the whole backend as a service\nthing I have to say I really don't miss anything. The whole experience feel\nvery robust and secure.\"\n\n@saxxone\n\n\"@supabase is lit. It took me less than 10 minutes to setup, the DX is just\namazing.\"\n\nShow More\n\n### What can you build with Supabase?\n\nThere are many example apps and starter projects to get you started.\n\nView all examples Official GitHub library\n\n#### Svelte kanban board\n\nA Trello clone using Supabase as the storage system.\n\njoshnuss\n\nsupabase-kanban\n\nLaunch Demo\n\n#### Next.js Realtime chat app\n\nNext.js Slack clone app using Supabase realtime subscriptions\n\nsupabase\n\nnextjs-slack-clone\n\nView Code\n\n#### Next.js Subscription and Auth\n\nThe all-in-one starter kit for high-performance SaaS applications.\n\nVercel\n\nnextjs-subscription-payments\n\nLaunch Demo\n\n#### Expo React Native Starter\n\nTemplate bottom tabs with auth flow (Typescript)\n\ncodingki\n\nreact-native-expo-template\n\nView Code\n\n#### NestJS example\n\nNestJS example using Supabase Auth\n\nhiro1107\n\nnestjs-supabase-auth\n\nView Code\n\n#### ReactJS realtime chat app\n\nExample app of real-time chat using supabase realtime api\n\nshwosner\n\nrealtime-chat-supabase-react\n\nLaunch Demo\n\n## Instant APIs that do the hard work for you\n\nWe introspect your database to provide APIs instantly.
