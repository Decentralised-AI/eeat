You\ncan use LanceDB to store and query anything \u2014 embeddings, documents and\nmetadata.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Scale up with on-disk storage\n\nUnlike other vector databases, LanceDB shines by querying persistent storage\nat breakneck speed. Scale from gigabytes to terabytes to petabytes without\nblowing out your budget or sacrificing performance.\n\n## \u2601\ufe0f Serverless\n\nNo need to manage separate servers. LanceDB OSS runs embedded into your\napplication. LanceDB Cloud scales seamlessly with no servers.\n\n# Ecosystem integrations\n\nLanceDB APIs work seamlessly with the growing Python and Javascript ecosystem.\nManipulate data with DataFrames, build models with Pydantic, store and query\nwith LanceDB.\n\n# Trusted by developers\n\nUsed by innovative companies building self-driving cars, generative AI apps,\ntv streaming services, personalized e-commerce and more\n\n\u201cGumtap is critically reliant on LanceDB: minimal operations overhead, best\nscaling, and it is inexpensive. It's pretty clear that it is the right\napproach towards vector search dbs.\u201d\n\nChris MoodyCTO, Gumtap\n\n\u201cLanceDB is a powerful, versatile, and user-friendly tool that has greatly\nenhanced our ability to handle large datasets and complex tasks. Its unique\nblend of features and capabilities makes it an invaluable asset in the field\nof data management. I highly recommend LanceDB - it truly is the real deal. \u201d\n\nJohn TrenklePrincipal Machine Learning Engineer, Tubi\n\n\u201cLanceDB felt powerful yet lightweight, and fit well into my workflow. It was\nfar more intuitive for me. It was as if SQLite, the Python data ecosystem, and\na vector database had a child and named it LanceDB.\u201d\n\nGreg RedaML Engineer Consultant, Ex-Instacart MLE\n\n# LanceDB Cloud\n\nNo servers to manage, auto re-indexing, caching, transparent pricing and a\ndashboard to manage your data.
