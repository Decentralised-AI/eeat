At any scale, with unbeatable performance.\n\nGet Started __Watch Video\n\n__\n\nOpen source: Download, or use our cloud service.\n\n# Building something real?\n\nYou'll need to co-locate vectors, metadata and content on the same item on the\nsame node, run inference there to achieve scalable performance, and seamlessly\nscale this across nodes to handle any amount of data and traffic. Vespa does\nall this for you so you can focus on building your application.\n\n# What is Vespa used for?\n\n## Search\n\nVespa is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports\nvector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the\nsame query. Integrated machine-learned model inference allows you to apply AI\nto make sense of your data in real time. Together with Vespa's proven scaling\nand high availability, this empowers you to create production ready search\napplications at any scale, and with any combination of features. more __\n\n## Recommendation and personalization\n\nRecommendation, personalization and targeting involves evaluating recommender\nmodels over content items to select the best ones. Vespa lets you build\napplications which do this online, typically combining fast vector search and\nfiltering with evaluation of machine-learned models over the items. This makes\nit possible to make recommendations specifically for each user or situation,\nusing completely up to date information. more __\n\n## Conversational AI\n\nLarge language models are revolutionary, but their usefulness for real tasks\nis limited by their lack of memory, trustworthiness, specific knowledge, and\nability to reason in many steps. To make more useful agents we must give the\nmodels the ability to store and search vector and text data in real time, and\norchestrate many such operations to carry out a task. Vespa is the ideal\nplatform for this, as it integrates all these building blocks in scalable\nform. more __\n\n## Semi-structured navigation\n\nApplications such as e-commerce use a combination of structured data and text\nand need to provide structured navigation - grouping data dynamically for\nnavigation and filtering - in combination with search and recommendation.\nVespa provides all the features required for this with great performance,\nwhich makes it possible to realize functionally complete applications\nleveraging structured data on a unified architecture. more __\n\n#### More use cases __\n\n## Structured, text & vector search\n\nCombine search in structured data, text and vectors in one query to achieve\nfunctionality and performance which is simply impossible with other\ntechnologies.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Machine learning support\n\nVespa is engineered around scalable and efficient support for machine-learned\nmodel inference, and supports most machine-learned models from most tools.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Auto-elastic data management\n\nVespa will automatically keep data distributed over nodes, and redistribute in\nthe background on changes. No need to worry about how data is divided and\ndistributed.\n\nLearn More\n\n## Unbeatable end-to-end performance\n\nVespa scales to any amount of data and traffic, and is built on a C++ core\nproviding hardware-near optimizations and efficient utilization of any amount\nof memory and cores.\n\nLearn More\n\n# Companies who take their data and AI online build on Vespa\n\n## Introducing Lucene Linguistics\n\n#### Dainius Jocas\n\n16 Oct 2023\n\n## HTTP/2 Rapid Reset (CVE-2023-44487)\n\n#### Kristian Aune\n\n11 Oct 2023\n\n## Vespa is becoming a company\n\n#### Jon Bratseth\n\n03 Oct 2023\n\n## Announcing search.vespa.ai\n\n#### Leandro Alves, Kristian Aune, Jo Kristian Bergum, and Valerij Fredriksen\n\n08 Sep 2023\n\n#### View more blogs __\n\n# Get Started today\n\n###  Vespa lets you do selection, organization and machine-learned model\ninference over billions of constantly changing data items, serving thousands\nof queries per second with latency below 100 milliseconds.\n\n###  Run it yourself, or try the Vespa cloud service for free.\n\nGet Started\n\n#### Resources\n\nDocumentation  \nOpen Source  \nRoadmap  \nReleases  \nIssues  \n\n#### Contact\n\nTwitter  \ninfo@vespa.ai  \nVespa.ai team  \nWe are hiring!  \nMailing list  \n\n#### Community\n\nSlack  \nStack Overflow  \nContributing  \nBlog  \n\n###### Copyright Vespa.ai\n\n"
