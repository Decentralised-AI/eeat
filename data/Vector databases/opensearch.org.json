This tool\nequips users to capture live traffic from their source cluster and replay it,\neither simultaneously or offline, on a specified shadow cluster for rigorous\ntesting and analysis. By comparing the performance and behavior of the source\nand target clusters under real workload conditions, users can gain valuable\ninsights. This enables the early detection of potential migration or version\nupgrade issues, facilitating a seamless transition to OpenSearch.\n\nThu, Oct 26, 2023\n\n#### technical post\n\n### Introducing a traffic capture and replay solution for OpenSearch\nmigrations and upgrades\n\nThu, Oct 26, 2023\n\n#### technical post\n\n### Efficient filtering in OpenSearch vector engine\n\nWed, Oct 18, 2023\n\n#### search\n\n### Introducing concurrent segment search in OpenSearch\n\nWed, Oct 18, 2023\n\n#### release\n\n### Get started with OpenSearch 2.11\n\nMon, Oct 16, 2023\n\n#### release\n\n### Announcing Data Prepper 2.5.0\n\nWed, Oct 11, 2023\n\n#### technical post\n\n### Byte-quantized vectors in OpenSearch\n\nMon, Oct 09, 2023\n\n#### community\n\n### Growth and community take the spotlight at OpenSearchCon 2023\n\nFri, Oct 06, 2023\n\nView All Blog Posts\n\n# OpenSearch Links\n\n#### Get Involved\n\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Forum\n  * Github\n  * Slack\n\n#### Resources\n\n  * About\n  * Release Schedule\n  * Maintenance Policy\n  * FAQ\n  * Testimonials\n  * Trademark and Brand Policy\n  * Privacy\n\n#### Contact Us\n\n  * Connect\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * YouTube\n  * Meetup\n  * Facebook\n\n\u00a9 OpenSearch contributors, 2023.
