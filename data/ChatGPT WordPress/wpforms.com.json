Once your site is connected to OpenAI, the plugin will send\na prompt to ChatGPT and bring back a response that you can use in helpful ways\non your site.\n\nThere are various WordPress plugins capable of adding AI to your website with\nChatGPT and your OpenAI API key. We\u2019ll list down some of the best ones in the\nnext section.\n\n## Best ChatGPT Plugins for WordPress\n\nUse the links below to jump down to a specific section. We loved these AI\nplugins during our testing, and we think you\u2019ll like them too!\n\nIn This Article\n\n  * 1\\. WPForms\n  * 2\\. All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\n  * 3\\. MemberPress\n  * 4\\. Formidable Forms\n  * 5\\. Uncanny Automator\n  * 6\\. Thrive Ovation\n  * 7\\. AI Engine\n  * Bonus: AI Power\n\n### 1\\. WPForms\n\nWPForms is a highly popular form builder for WordPress. It has a nearly\nperfect score of 4.9/5 on WP.org, thanks to its user-friendliness.\n\nOne of the many amazing features of WPForms is that you can integrate it with\nChatGPT. This is a powerful integration that allows you to build even smarter\nforms.\n\nFor instance, you can create a form that uses ChatGPT to create an AI-\ngenerated blog post draft when the form is submitted.\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT to automatically generate a post draft with an\narticle outline. It\u2019s an excellent solution for writers because it speeds up\nthe blog writing process when ChatGPT is taking care of developing high-\nquality post outlines for you.\n\nYou can even send AI-generated notifications to visitors when they submit a\nform. Unlike standard notifications that use the same template for everyone,\nChatGPT can create smarter notifications for your forms.\n\nHere\u2019s the notification we created by taking a form submission and using it in\na prompt:\n\nThere are endless use cases for the WPForms-ChatGPT integration. You can even\nuse it to create images from form entries.\n\nIn order to connect WPForms with ChatGPT, you\u2019ll need a WordPress plugin\ncalled Uncanny Automator, which lets you create this integration for free.\n\nApart from integrating with ChatGPT, WPForms has an extensive range of\nadvanced features. If you\u2019re a Pro user, you\u2019ll get 1,300+ WordPress form\ntemplates to help you build forms even faster. Plus, WPForms lets you\ncustomize the layout and styles of your forms without writing any code.\n\nIf you want to create calculators or perform calculations within your forms,\nthe WPForms Calculations addon makes it possible. The calculations\nfunctionality gives WPForms an edge in functionality that many other form-\nbuilding plugins don\u2019t have.\n\nYou can integrate WPForms natively with the top marketing and CRM platforms\nlike Constant Contact, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), HubSpot, and more.\n\nOverall, WPForms is a super useful plugin if you want to take advantage of\nChatGPT\u2019s powerful capabilities for your WordPress site.\n\n### 2\\. All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\n\nAIOSEO makes it stupid simple for beginners to improve search engine\noptimization (SEO) for their WordPress site.\n\nWhile this plugin is full of top-quality features, we were particularly\nimpressed by this plugin\u2019s AI-generated suggestions for post titles and\ndescriptions.\n\nThe AI title generator tool in AIOSEO integrates with ChatGPT to generate\ntitle ideas for your post. The best part is that you don\u2019t have to leave your\nWordPress editor to get these suggestions.\n\nInstead, it lets you generate suggestions within the post title field so you\ninstantly add the headline you like.\n\nWe tested it out by generating 5 title ideas, and it worked well. If you don\u2019t\nlike its suggestions, you can generate new one until you find something you\nlike (as long as your API tokens don\u2019t run out).\n\nThe title suggestions we got were optimized based on the content, and they\u2019re\nalso pretty catchy:\n\nJust to note: we were also able to generate meta descriptions this way.\n\nWriting a good title is usually a time-consuming process, even for expert\ncopywriters. This ChatGPT integration can significantly improve the quality of\nyour post headlines and meta descriptions.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend using AIOSEO with its ChatGPT\nintegration to work smarter when optimizing your posts. _We even used it\nourselves to generate the title of this post!_\n\n### 3\\. MemberPress\n\nMemberPress is a super popular membership plugin for WordPress.\n\nWe love this plugin for its excellent versatility. It lets you create full-\nfledged membership sites with all the necessary features to manage them\nefficiently.\n\nIt gets even more interesting when you connect MemberPress with ChatGPT.\n\nFor instance, if you offer online courses, you can use the MemberPress Courses\naddon along with ChatGPT to generate course outlines quickly.\n\nWe created an automation that uses ChatGPT to create a course outline, which\nis then used to automatically create a new course post based on ChatGPT\u2019s\nresponse.\n\nHere\u2019s the result of our automation, which created a complete course draft in\nour test WordPress site. All we had to do was send a course idea to ChatGPT\nusing a form:\n\nTo follow the same process we tried, you\u2019ll need:\n\n  * WPForms\n  * MemberPress with the Courses addon activated\n  * Uncanny Automator\n  * ChatGPT integration set up in Uncanny Automator.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve built a form to capture course ideas, you can create a recipe in\nUncanny Automator that sends a prompt to ChatGPT based on the course idea\nsubmitted via the form. MemberPress Courses will then use ChatGPT\u2019s response\nto generate a draft of the course on your WordPress site.\n\nThis kind of automation is perfect for streamlining your course creation\nprocess.\n\n### 4\\. Formidable Forms\n\nFormidable Forms is another high quality form plugin for WordPress. It\nincludes tons of powerful features for building advanced forms on your site.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking to incorporate ChatGPT within your forms, Formidable\nForms has got you covered on that front too.\n\nWe liked testing Formidable Forms\u2019 AI field. It generates a ChatGPT response\nwithin your form based on user input:\n\nThis could be helpful if you wanted to add an AI assistant within a form to\nhelp address your customers\u2019 questions. You can give more context in the field\noptions to help it produce relevant answers that match the user\u2019s\nexpectations.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT doesn\u2019t have any specialized knowledge about your business.\nAs a result, its utility as a customer support assistant is fairly limited.\n\nRegardless, you can use Formidable Forms\u2019 AI field in countless ways to\nleverage ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities for your WordPress site.\n\n### 5\\. Uncanny Automator\n\nYou may have noticed that we\u2019re big fans of Uncanny Automator and use it with\nmany of our own sites.\n\nThis plugin brings two or more apps and plugins together, like WPForms,\nMemberPress, ChatGPT, and hundreds more, to help you automate WordPress tasks.\n\nTo connect a plugin with ChatGPT, you must create a \u201crecipe\u201d involving a\ntrigger and an action event. The trigger is something that happens in a\nWordPress plugin, while ChatGPT handles the action part to automate something.\n\nHundreds of plugins and apps can be connected with ChatGPT in useful ways.\n\nThe best part is that most of the supported ChatGPT integrations are free with\nonly minor limitations. While free users can access OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model, Pro\nusers can also access Davinci model for more advanced content creation.\n\n### 6\\. Thrive Ovation\n\nThrive Ovation is a handy plugin that simplifies how you capture, manage, and\ndisplay testimonials on your site.\n\nWhile testing Thrive Ovation, we discovered a really powerful way to utilize\nit with ChatGPT to build social proof for your audience.\n\nWe set up an automation that uses ChatGPT to perform a sentiment analysis on\neach new testimonial submitted. The testimonials with a positive sentiment can\nthen be automatically posted to your Facebook page.\n\nYou can use Uncanny Automator to connect Thrive Ovation with ChatGPT. Once the\nautomation is set up, all of the steps take place without your supervision.\nThere\u2019s no need to manually check the best testimonials on your site to post\non your social media channels.\n\nThis is a really efficient way to build trust with your audience using\nChatGPT\u2019s sentiment analysis capabilities.\n\n### 7\\. AI Engine\n\nAI Engine is a versatile plugin that includes a range of ChatGPT-based AI\ntools for WordPress.\n\nIt allows you to use ChatGPT as a chatbot for users on your site. You can\neasily embed the AI chatbot on any page using a shortcode.\n\nAI Engine also gives you an AI content generation tool for creating new posts\non your site.\n\nWe like that this tool lets you control the structure of your post by\nspecifying the number of sections and paragraphs per section. Based on your\ninstructions, it can be used to generate high-quality content at scale,\nalthough you\u2019ll need to edit it and check it for accuracy.\n\nThis plugin also adds a title and excerpt generator within your block editor\nto help speed up your post writing. We were impressed to find that you can\nalso use it to generate images in WordPress based on your given prompts. These\ncapabilities can be very helpful for bloggers and content writers.\n\nOverall, AI Engine can access ChatGPT\u2019s most useful capabilities without\nrequiring you to leave your WordPress site.\n\n### Bonus: AI Power\n\nAI Power offers many features similar to AI Engine. It comes with a wide range\nof AI tools within a single plugin, including a content generator, image\ngenerator, and audio converter for transcripts.\n\nBeyond that, AI Power also gives you various ChagGPT-based forms with ready-\nmade templates. These are role-specific forms with two main components: input\nfields that ChatGPT can read and a response field that displays ChatGPT\u2019s\nanswer.\n\nFor instance, you can generate a thoughtful Reddit discussion, obtain tips for\nrefining your resume based on your qualifications, and lots more.\n\nExperiment with AI Power and find some helpful uses for your website. If you\nfind any useful prompts, let us know in the comments; we\u2019d love to try them.\n\n### Next, Check Out These Intake Form Examples\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for intake form inspirations, you can check out our guide on\nintake form examples with pre-built templates available in WPForms.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re wondering how WPForms compares with other top form builders in\nthe market, see our comparison on Everest Forms vs WPForms.\n\nCreate Your WordPress Form Now\n\nReady to build your form?
