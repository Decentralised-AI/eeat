As\nan experiment, I asked ChatGPT to write a plugin that could save my wife some\ntime with managing her website. I wrote a short description and ChatGPT wrote\nthe whole thing: user interface, logic, and all.\n\nIn less than five minutes.\n\n**Also:  ** **The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and other fun alternatives to\ntry**\n\nThere are implications. We'll get to that in a few minutes. First, let me take\nyou through the experience and what went down.\n\n## The need\n\nChatGPT wrote the plugin that generates this UI and processes the lines.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nMy wife is the proprietor of a WordPress-based e-commerce site focused on a\npopular hobby. She also hosts a very active Facebook group for customers of\nher site. Every month she randomizes a list of names, and then does a virtual\nwheel spin animation, using that randomized list, for the Facebook group. She\nhas been using a site on the internet that does a fair job of randomizing\nlines, but charges a bit more than it's worth for exporting the list.\n\n **Also:** **Can AI detectors save us from ChatGPT? I tried 3 online tools to\nfind out**\n\nAs I watched her struggle to get the randomized names back out, I thought it\nmight be helpful if I wrote a quick WordPress plugin we could install on her\nsite. She's in the dashboard every day, so having that as a tool would be\nhelpful.\n\nBut even a simple plugin would take me a few days to write, what with the user\ninterface elements and logic code, and I'm pretty full up on projects these\ndays.\n\nAnd then I thought of ChatGPT. There's been some discussion about ChatGPT as a\nprogramming tool in the media, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n##  The prompt\n\nOutput from ChatGPT (from my first, most basic prompt)\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThe key to getting ChatGPT to generate anything is a carefully written prompt.\nIn the case of programming, think of it as being a manager or client. You have\nto clearly describe what you need in order to get what you want. I started\nwith a very basic prompt, just to see if it would work. Here's the prompt I\nused:\n\n> Write a PHP 8 compatible WordPress plugin that provides a text entry field\n> where a list of lines can be pasted into it and a button, that when pressed,\n> randomizes the lines in the list and presents the results in a second text\n> entry field.\n\nWithin a minute, it generated the code you see to the right. I copied the\ngenerated code into a .php file, put it into a folder with the same root name\nas the .php file, compressed it, and uploaded it to her server. It worked.\n\n**Also:** **Russian hackers are trying to break into ChatGPT, says Check\nPoint**\n\nWhen I showed it to my wife, she was suitably impressed and surprised. But\nthen the gears started to turn and she asked for a new feature: make sure\nduplicate names are not side-by-side.\n\nFor her application, she'll sometimes need to include someone's name on a list\nmany times over. But she didn't want those duplicates to cluster.\n\nI modified my original prompt, adding the following additional conditions:\n\n> \u2026makes sure no two identical entries are next to each other (unless there's\n> no other option)\u2026with the number of lines submitted and the number of lines\n> in the result identical to each other.\n\nI included the \"unless there's no other option\" phrase and the identical count\nrequirement because I wanted to make sure all the names were included, and I\nwas concerned that it would prioritize the need for no two names to be side-\nby-side over keeping all the names.\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, I had a new plugin. I uploaded that one to the server\nand tried it out. It worked, but the output included some blank lines. So I\nadded this condition to my previous prompt:\n\n> \u2026with no blank lines\u2026\n\nBy now, I'd grown accustomed to the turnaround time, which was always less\nthan a minute. One more upload and test, and again, it worked.\n\n**Also:** **How to use ChatGPT**\n\nI wanted one final feature, just to confirm how many lines had been processed.\nI wanted the plugin to show a count of lines for the entry and output fields.\nHere's that prompt addition:\n\n> \u2026Under the first field, display text stating \"Line to randomize: \" with the\n> number of nonempty lines in the source field. Under the second field,\n> display text stating \"Lines that have been randomized: \" with the number of\n> non-empty lines in the destination field.\n\nThis worked, mostly. Before running, the output field shows one line. But once\nthe randomize process is completed, it shows the exact right number of lines\nin both fields.\n\n##  The code quality\n\nOverall, the code quality was clean. I'm only presenting the original response\nbecause otherwise it wouldn't fit in the article. The program properly\ngenerated the WordPress header block and wrote the dashboard user interface\nfor the plugin, as well as the plugin's processing logic.\n\nIt did put my summary lines above the fields, even though I specified below,\nbut that's not a big complaint. It's the same sort of mistake a client might\nget back from a human contractor, and then require a bit of rework to fix.\n\n**Also:** **Can Notion AI writing helper write this article?**\n\nCoding worked, but it didn't incorporate all the best practices for WordPress\nprogramming. For example, it didn't sanitize the user input. The WordPress\ncommunity is rigorous about sanitizing input so hackers can't stuff fields\nwith data that can corrupt a site -- and this code had none of that.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence\n\n  * AI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged \n\n  * These are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI \n\n  * AI at the edge: 5G and the Internet of Things see fast times ahead \n\n  * Almost half of tech executives say their organizations aren't ready for AI or other advanced initiatives \n\nAs a later test, I did instruct the Ai to sanitize input, and it did\u2026 to a\npoint. It sanitized the input inside the PHP function, but it did not sanitize\nthe input when calling PHP within HTML. That would have definitely left an\nopening for hackers.\n\nIt also dropped the plugin's menu item into Settings. I probably would have\nput it under Tools or given the feature its own menu item. Since I didn't\nspecify where it should be invoked from, I think ChatGPT made a workable\ndecision in placing the menu item where it did.\n\nI added one final requirement to my prompt, requesting the AI give the plugin\na name:\n\n> Write a PHP 8 compatible WordPress plugin called \"Robo Randomizer\" that\u2026\n\nWeirdly enough, the AI gave me an entirely different plugin, generating a\nplugin that provides a shortcode rather than a dashboard interface. Let me\nexplain that to non-WordPress users, because it's interesting.\n\nWhen writing something like this, you can make it available on the website to\nvisitors (called the frontend) or to those who log in to the site's dashboard\nto maintain the side (the backend). In my original set of prompts, I did not\nspecify frontend or backend, but the AI wrote what I wanted, which was a\nbackend, dashboard interface for the tool.\n\n**Also:**   **OpenAI is hiring developers to make ChatGPT better at coding**\n\nBut this last time, it decided to write the plugin as a frontend tool, making\nit execute through a shortcode. In WordPress, you can embed a shortcode\n(something like [randomize lines]) within a post and it will run code in a\nplugin. The last version that the AI produced gave me such a shortcode, which\nwould have allowed the randomize lines feature to be presented to site\nvisitors.\n\nAfter this, ChatGPT kind of lost the thread. I wasn't able to get additional\nfeatures added to the original plugin and ChatGPT mostly just repeated\ngenerating the shortcode version. Clearly, code maintenance is not a ChatGPT\ncore strength.\n\n##  Implications\n\nObviously, this is a simple plugin. It's roughly the size of the assignments I\ngave to my first year programming students when I taught at UC Berkeley. It\ndoesn't come close to the complexity of the much, much larger open source\nWordPress plugins I maintain for 50,000+ users.\n\n**Also:** **With AI chatbots, are we looking for answers in all the wrong\nplaces?**\n\nLast week, when I first used ChatGPT to build the quickie plugin for my wife\nand tweeted about it, correspondents on my socials pushed back. Here were some\nof their concerns:\n\n **Is it evil?** One person was concerned that the AI would embed malicious\n(or at least promotional) information in the plugin and a non-programmer user\nwould never know. But the fact is, if you're not a coder and can't read code,\neven if you contract with another human, you don't really know what's inside.\nIt all comes down to either trusting reputation, or getting someone you do\ntrust to look through the code. In the case of the code produced in my\nexperiment, it was clean.\n\n**Is it the best it can be?** Here again, folks were holding up the AI's code\nto a different standard than even human coders. I'm a good programmer, but my\ncode has bugs. It's not the best it can be\u2026at least not at first. But with\nhumans, code gets better over time. I'm not sure if an AI can take existing\ncode, improve it, debug it, and enhance it. However, sometimes things just\nneed to be functional. It doesn't always matter if they're the best of the\nbest. Good enough is often good enough. And it generated code that was good\nenough.\n\n**Will it reduce the number of human programming gigs?** Almost undoubtedly. I\nhate to see a machine take any person's job (especially if it's one I might\nwant). AI is definitely an option for quick and easy projects, whether that's\nwriting or programming. People's paychecks will be impacted, no doubt.\n\nI've been studying AI for decades. I did a thesis on AI. But even with all\nthat background, this surge in high-quality generative AI has been startling\nto me. That said, what we're looking at now is the \"good enough\" level of\nproductivity. Unfortunately, that's what many clients demand.\n\nBut -- at least for now -- ChatGPT and its friends can't write super in-depth\nanalysis articles like this, because they reflect opinions, anecdotes, and\nyears of experience. And while they could probably write subroutines and\nfunctions for larger coding projects, they're just not able to write major\ncoding projects.\n\n**Also:** **Google's ChatGPT competitor demo goes wrong**\n\nFor example, I've had to have 20-30 meetings over the last year with a major\nAPI provider to integrate their service into mine. Most of those meetings\nmixed business issues with technical requirements and licensing policies. I\ndefy any AI to put up with, understand the nuances of, and meet the partner\nrequirements of that kind of bureaucratic situation, and then be able to\nproduce code modules everyone can agree upon.\n\nSo, yes, I'm a bit freaked by how good the plugin was that I \"made\" for my\nwife. But the AI has a long way to go before it's taking work from experienced\ndevelopers and writers -- as long as clients _want_ the kind of work\nexperienced developers and writers produce. And that, my friends, is something\nI _do_ worry about.\n\n* * *\n\n_You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.
