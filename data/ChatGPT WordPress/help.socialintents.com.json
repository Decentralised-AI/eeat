Create a Live Chat app in Social Intents\n  2. Create your OpenAI API Key after registration\n  3. Add your OpenAI API Key to your Social Intents chatbot settings.\n  4. Deploy your Live Chat plugin to WordPress using our WordPress Live Chat Plugin.\n\n### 1\\. Create a Live Chat app in Social Intents\n\nIf you don't already have an account with Social Intents, simply register for\na Free Trial.\n\nOnce you sign up you can pick an integration with Microsoft Teams, Slack or a\nstandalone account.  The integrations will be used to invite in Live Chat\nagents when you want to escalate a website chat from the chatbot to live chat\nagents.  You can answer chats in Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, or Webex.\nOtherwise, you can answer the chats directly in our web-based dashboard.\n\n### 2\\.  Create your OpenAI account\n\nIf you haven't already, sign up for your OpenAI account here:\n\nOnce logged in to OpenAI, click on your profile and select 'View API keys'\n\nNow create a new API Key to use in your Social Intents Chatbot Settings for\nintegration.\n\n** Please note that you need to add billing information to OpenAI in order to\nuse the ChatGPT api.\n\n### 3\\. Add your OpenAI API Key to Social Intents\n\nNow that you have create a Live Chat app, go to the Chat Settings in Social\nIntents by clicking on My Apps, then Edit Settings of your chat widget.  Click\non the Chatbot Settings tab.\n\nIn your Chatbot Settings name your bot, choose an avatar for the chat bot and\nselect Chatbot Type of 'ChatGPT with OpenAI'.\n\nYou can then decide how you want your chatbot to be invited into the chat.\nYou can have a chatbot only, then invite agents later, have it pick up only\nwhen your live chat agents are offline or miss a chat, or join the same time\nyour agents join.\n\nFor ChatGPT Model, you can choose any of the models the OpenAI supports with\nthe Chat API: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat\n\nWe choose the current chat model: gpt-3.5-turbo.\n\nCopy your OpenAI API Key into the field called: ChatGPT API Key.\n\nNext you can customize your ChatGPT Welcome text with a Default Welcome\nResponse, and Quick Reply buttons to help direct your users.\n\nThe Human Escalation trigger phrases can be used to match on user intent when\nthey want to reach to a live agent.  When one of these phrases is matched, we\ninvite your human agents by sending Live Chat Invites to Microsoft Teams,\nSlack, Zoom, or Webex.\n\nOnce your agents answer the chats, then the bot drops out of the conversation.\n\nFinally, because training isn't yet supported in the OpenAI Chat API yet,\nwe've exposed Instruction Phrases to allow to you send an initial System\nmessage when starting a chat to give your ChatGPT bot some context.\n\nOnce ChatGPT 4 is widely available, we'll open up additional options for\ntraining and plugins.\n\n### 4\\.  Deploy ChatGPT to WordPress using the WordPress Plugin\n\nFinally, you simply install the Live Chat by Social Intents WordPress Plugin\nand add the Live Chat API Key to the plugin settings.\n\n#### Find your WordPress Plug API Key in Social Intents\n\nNow that you've set up an account in Social Intents, you'll want to grab your\nWordPress API key which you will copy into the WordPress plugin settings.\nWe'll go through the details of finding your WordPress Plugin API key for\nMicrosoft Teams, Webex, and Slack users below.\n\n#### For Microsoft Teams Users\n\n###\n\nIf you are using our Live Chat for Microsoft Teams app, you can find your code\nsnippet under your Chat Settings.  Click on the Live Chat app in the let\nsidebar (or add it if you haven't yet to your team), and then go to your Live\nChat settings.  Click on the Install Code Snippet tab in the settings to find\nthe key:\n\n#### **For Slack, Zoom, and Webex Live Chat Users**\n\nIf you are not using Microsoft Teams, simply Login to your Social Intents\naccount and click on the Install Code Snippet Link in the lefthand navigation:\n\nYou'll see a popup that will display your WordPress API Key:\n\nSave this API key for use in the next step below.\n\n### Add your ChatGPT Live Chat plugin to WordPress\n\nNext we will add the Live Chat plugin to WordPress.  Go to your WordPress\nadmin site and then to the Plugin link.  Click on the Add New button to add a\nplugin.\n\nNow, search for the plugin named: 'Live Chat for Microsoft Teams and Slack',\nthen click 'Install Now'\n\nOnce installed, click on 'Settings' in the Plugin\n\nNow you'll see a text field called Your app key.
