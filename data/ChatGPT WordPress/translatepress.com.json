But at the same time, the headline is incredibly important because\nit\u2019s what convinces people to click/read the article.\n\nWith AI, you can quickly brainstorm multiple headline ideas and then pick the\none that you think will perform the best.\n\nYou could even test the different headline suggestions against one another\nusing a plugin like Title Experiments.\n\n### Write SEO Titles and Meta Descriptions\n\nIn addition to writing your post\u2019s headline, AI can also help you create SEO\ntitles and meta descriptions for your content.\n\nThe basic idea here is the same \u2013 you use AI to brainstorm a list of ideas and\nthen you choose the one that you think will work the best.\n\nYou could even split-test different AI SEO titles using a tool like\nSEOTesting.com.\n\n### Write Drafts for Complete Blog Posts (That You Edit)\n\nIf you want to go further than headlines and SEO titles, ChatGPT and other\nlarge language models are also capable of writing full blog posts.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t advocate using AI to bulk-generate content on your WordPress\nsite, AI can be a great time-saving tool to write the first draft of long-form\ncontent.\n\nOnce you have the draft, you can go in and manually improve, refine, and\nverify the text to make sure you\u2019re publishing quality content.\n\nPlugins like GPT AI Power let you use GPT-3 to generate full blog posts in a\nseparate box in the WordPress editor. Then, you can paste some/all of the\ncontent into the actual text editor.\n\nIf you\u2019re ok with working outside of WordPress, there are tons of AI writer\ntools powered by GPT-3, such as Jasper.\n\n### Research Topics More Quickly\n\nIn addition to helping you create content from scratch, artificial\nintelligence can also be a valuable research tool.\n\nYou can ask tools like ChatGPT to summarize topics or websites to help you\nmore quickly grasp the main points.\n\nIf you want to access this type of ChatGPT research without leaving your\nWordPress dashboard, you can play around with tools like the ChatGPTforWP\nbrowser extension. While it\u2019s not a plugin, it is built specifically for\nWordPress and lets you interact with ChatGPT from the Block Editor interface.\n\n### Translate Your Website Content\n\nWhile much of the AI focus has been on large language models like GPT-3, it\u2019s\nworth remembering that there are other ways that artificial intelligence can\nhelp your WordPress site.\n\nFor example, since 2016, Google Translate has used an AI-powered neural\nmachine translation approach that performs translation by encoding the\nsemantics of a sentence rather than just using phrase-to-phrase translation\nlike older approaches.\n\nWith a plugin like TranslatePress, you can automatically translate your site\u2019s\ncontent using Google Translate and then manually refine the translations as\nneeded.\n\nThis is similar to the idea of using GPT-3 to write content \u2013 Google Translate\ncan do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and then you just need to edit and\nrefine.\n\nIf you want to automatically translate your WordPress site with Google\nTranslate\u2019s neural machine translation approach, we have step-by-step guides\non how you can use the free TranslatePress plugin:\n\n  * How to automatically translate WordPress\n  * How to automatically translate WooCommerce\n\n### TranslatePress Multilingual\n\nThe best way to automatically translate WordPress using Google Translate's\nmachine learning AI algorithm.\n\nGet the plugin\n\nOr download FREE version\n\n### Create Your Own AI-Powered Chatbot\n\nAnother helpful application of WordPress artificial intelligence is to\nactually create your own chatbot, like ChatGPT.\n\nYou can use this chatbot to offer support, sell more effectively, or just\ngenerally to create a fun, engaging experience for your visitors.\n\nThere are tools and plugins that let you use similar language models to\nChatGPT, but customized for your own website.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this application, the AI Engine plugin from Jordy Meow\nis the most popular option. It lets you\u2026\n\n  * Customize the tone/voice\n  * Tell the AI to act in a certain way\n  * Feed it your site\u2019s content so that the AI model can discuss the current page\n  * Etc.\n\nThe developer even has a full guide on training the AI model for your site.\n\n### Add Alt Text to Images\n\nAdding alt text to images is important for creating an accessible website and\nalso localizing your site for visitors from different geographic areas.\n\nHowever, manually adding alt text to images can be a chore. To fix this, you\ncan use a WordPress AI plugin to automatically add relevant image alt text for\nyou.\n\nFor example, if you post a picture of a yellow bird sitting on a branch, the\nAI tool would automatically add image alt text along the lines of \u201cA yellow\nbird sitting on a branch\u201d.\n\nThis application of WordPress AI has actually been around for a long time,\nlong before ChatGPT and other similar models gained popularity.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used the Automatic Alternative Text plugin, which is based on\nMicrosoft\u2019s Cognitive Services Computer Vision API. While that plugin hasn\u2019t\nbeen updated in years now, there seem to be plenty of other options including\nImage SEO, Alt Text AI, and others.\n\nIn general, these plugins work very well for images with real-life visuals.\nHowever, they don\u2019t work well if you\u2019re primarily using screenshots of\nwebsite/software interfaces.\n\nFor example, if I were writing a tutorial on how to translate WordPress using\nDeepL, the plugin would not be able to automatically generate image alt text\nfor the images in the setup instructions.\n\n### Create a Custom Plugin for Your Specific Use Case\n\nIn addition to creating text, another way in which WordPress users have been\napplying ChatGPT is to create the code for custom plugins.\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve seen, ChatGPT can actually be surprisingly adept at this.\nFor example, Johnathan Williams had ChatGPT create several different WordPress\nplugins with good ( _but not perfect_ ) results.\n\nWhile ChatGPT probably isn\u2019t able to create the next WooCommerce plugin (\n_yet, at least_ ), it can work well for small, feature-specific plugins.\n\nCreating a ChatGPT WordPress plugin like this could allow you to quickly add\nsmall features and adjustments to your site without needing to use a third-\nparty plugin that may or may not do what you need.\n\nIt can also help you eliminate bloat, because you can have ChatGPT code a\nplugin for your exact need, whereas plugin developers need to create more\nflexible plugins for the mass market.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT still isn\u2019t perfect here. So unless you have the development\nknowledge to review and adjust ChatGPT\u2019s work, you probably won\u2019t be able to\nbenefit from this _quite yet_.\n\n## The Potential Downsides of Using Artificial Intelligence in WordPress\n\nWhile there are a lot of ways in which a WordPress AI plugin can help your\nsite, there are also some potential downsides that you\u2019ll want to consider\nbefore you go all-out with using something like ChatGPT on your site.\n\n### AI Content Isn\u2019t Always Right \u2013 But It\u2019s Confident\n\nOne of the biggest issues with AI content right now is that it\u2019s not perfect\nand it still makes lots of factual mistakes.\n\nFor example, take this Tweet from Miklos Zoltan where Bing\u2019s ChatGPT tool made\nup facts about his company and even attributed quotes to Miklos that Miklos\nhas never said.\n\nWhile these inaccurate responses aren\u2019t the norm, it\u2019s very hard to tell when\nChatGPT is providing false information because it still sounds so confident\neven when making stuff up. In fact, sometimes it seems like ChatGPT deserves\nto end up on the Reddit r/confidentlyincorrect subreddit.\n\nUnless you have the subject matter expertise to review the content that a\nChatGPT WordPress plugin generates (or the willingness to hire someone who\ndoes), you probably shouldn\u2019t go all-in on using AI to generate long-form\ncontent.\n\n### We Don\u2019t Know How Search Engines Will Treat AI Content Long Term\n\nBecause ChatGPT and other models are so new, we still don\u2019t know the long-term\neffects of how Google is going to treat AI content ( _or even whether Google\nwill be able to detect AI content at scale_ ).\n\n_And oh yeah, I guess we should also include Bing as a search engine now,\nbecause it seems like some people might actually use it now that Bing has the\nOpenAI partnership._\n\nIf search engine optimization is an important part of your marketing strategy,\nyou might want to see how things shake out before going all-in.\n\nGoogle has clarified that it doesn\u2019t think AI content is _automatically_ bad.\nThis Tweet thread from Danny Sullivan covers some AI SEO issues\n\nThe general idea is that using AI to assist your content creation efforts is\nok if you\u2019re still creating helpful, accurate, and unique content.\n\nHowever, using AI to mass-generate content just to get more search clicks is\nstill going to get you on Google\u2019s naughty list.\n\nIt might work for a while \u2013 and plenty of people are successfully gaming\nGoogle with AI content right now. But as a long-term strategy, it\u2019s probably\nnot a good idea to rely on long-form AI content, unless you\u2019re heavily editing\nit.\n\n## Three WordPress AI Plugins to Experiment With AI\n\nIf you\u2019re sold on the idea of using ChatGPT and/or artificial intelligence to\nbenefit your WordPress site(s), your next question might be whether you can\nfind any ChatGPT WordPress plugins to help you more easily implement these\ntactics.\n\nWe mentioned a few of these plugins above, but we\u2019ll quickly recap some of the\ntop options in this section.\n\nBut first \u2013 it\u2019s also worth pointing out that you don\u2019t necessarily need a\nChatGPT WordPress plugin to benefit from GPT and AI in general. Instead, you\ncan just use the AI tool\u2019s interface and manually add the content to\nWordPress.\n\nThis might even be a good idea because it forces you to manually review all\nthe content that you\u2019re adding to your site.\n\n### AI Engine\n\nAI Engine is sort of like a playground for all things WordPress artificial\nintelligence.\n\nOne of its most fleshed-out features is the ability to create and train your\nown content-aware AI chatbot, as we mentioned earlier.\n\nBut it can also help you implement WordPress AI in other ways:\n\n  * Generate suggestions for headlines and excerpts\n  * Write WooCommerce product descriptions\n  * Write complete articles\n  * Generate images using DALL-E\n\nAll of these tools are powered by the OpenAI API.\n\n### GPT AI Power\n\nGPT AI Power is another popular WordPress AI plugin that helps you integrate\nGPT-3 AI content into a ton of different areas of your site.\n\nLike AI Engine, GPT AI Power is also based on OpenAI\u2019s tools and offers the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Title/headline suggestion tool\n  * Bulk automatic content writer\n  * Image generator (via DALL-E and Stable Diffusion)\n  * WooCommerce product writer\n  * GPT-based web forms\n  * Chatbot tool to offer an AI-powered chatbot on your site.\n\nIt also includes a database of prompts that you can use.\n\n### ChatGPTForWP\n\nChatGPTForWP is not a ChatGPT WordPress plugin _per se_. Instead, it\u2019s a web\nbrowser extension that lets you access ChatGPT from inside your WordPress\ndashboard and otherwise integrate it with your site.\n\nWith the extension installed, you\u2019ll be able to access ChatGPT from a sidebar\nin the WordPress editor. Note \u2013 it only works with the WordPress block editor\n(Gutenberg) \u2013 it does _not_ work if you\u2019re still using the classic TinyMCE\neditor.\n\nThe extension is available for Chrome and Firefox.\n\nIt\u2019s free for two basic prompts, but $9 per month for access to all of the\nprompts.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence for WordPress: What Do You Think?\n\nThat wraps up our thoughts on how ChatGPT and artificial intelligence can help\nWordPress site owners\u2026as well as a few of the pitfalls to avoid.\n\nOverall, at least in its current iteration, you should probably use AI as a\ntool to help you create content on your WordPress site, rather than a complete\nsolution in itself.\n\nIt can help you improve your headlines/SEO titles, write drafts of entire blog\nposts, chat with your visitors, translate your website\u2019s content, and more.\n\n### TranslatePress Multilingual\n\nThe best way to automatically translate WordPress using Google Translate's\nmachine learning AI algorithm.\n\nGet the plugin\n\nOr download FREE version\n\n**Now it\u2019s over to you \u2013 how do you plan to use AI to help your WordPress\nsites?
