If this key falls into\nthe wrong hands, it can be misused in a variety of detrimental ways, including\nunauthorized usage, potential data leaks, and the improper application of AI\nmodels. It\u2019s crucial, therefore, to implement the following protective\nmeasures:\n\n  1. Secure key storage: Ensure your API keys are stored in a safe and secure manner.\n  2. Monitor and review usage: Frequently scrutinize and evaluate the usage of your API key. OpenAI provides handy usage data and records that can assist in detecting unusual activity. For insightful usage statistics, visit https://platform.openai.com/account/usage.\n  3. Establish usage limits: Initially, implement a low hard limit to ensure that if the limit is reached at any point during the month, any further requests will be denied. You can set up both hard and soft limits at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits.\n  4. Regular key rotation: Frequently changing your API keys can reduce the risk of misuse. If you observe any unexpected activity, it\u2019s important to immediately revoke your API keys. As a preventative measure, you might want to regularly revoke them to avert misuse. Manage your API keys at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.\n\nRemember, wielding AI power requires immense responsibility \u2014 it\u2019s incumbent\nupon us all to ensure its careful and secure use.\n\n### Your Journey Towards an Interactive Website Begins!\n\nWith Chatbot ChatGPT installed, you\u2019re now equipped to offer a more dynamic,\nengaging, and responsive experience to your website visitors.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nInitial Chatbot ChatGPT display\n\nAsk Chatbot ChatGPT any question\n\nGet a response from Chatbot ChatGPT\n\nChatbot ChatGPT running in the embedded mode\n\nMobile Experience - Initial Chatbot ChatGPT display\n\nMobile Experience - Ask Chatbot ChatGTP any question\n\nMobile Experience - Get a response from Chatbot ChatGPT\n\nMobile Experience - Chatbot ChatGPT minimize (Lower Right)\n\nChatbot ChatGPT shown in Wide mode\n\nOptional custom Avatars to greet visitors with a configurable message\n\nAvatar greeting with message\n\nKnowledge Navigator Settings\n\nChatbot ChatGPT response after running Knowledge Navigator\n\nChatbot ChatGPT is now more context responsive after running Knowledge\nNavigator\n\nChatbot ChatGPT has a deep understanding of your site after running Knowledge\nNavigator\n\nSettings and Options\n\n## Installation\n\n**Installing Chatbot ChatGPT on Your WordPress Website**\n\nEmbark on a journey to elevate your website\u2019s interactivity with our Chatbot\nChatGPT plugin.
