Uncover the transformative power of ChatGPT for WordPress\njourney, from crafting compelling blog posts to enhancing user\ninteractions._**\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE\n\nToggle\n\n  * The MemberPress ChatGPT Integration\n  * AI Promises a Bigger Impact Than Crypto\n  * How Do You Use ChatGPT with WordPress?\n  * Using ChatGPT to Write an Amazing Blog Post on WordPress\n  * How to Integrate ChatGPT with WordPress\n  * Create Custom GPTs to Streamline Even Further\n  * Automatically Create Blog Post Outlines for WordPress with ChatGPT\n  * How to Create a Course Using ChatGPT\n  * Reply to WordPress Blog Comments with ChatGPT\n  * More Ways to Use ChatGPT with WordPress\n  * Wrapping Up The ChatGPT WordPress Guide\n\nHere at MemberPress, we like to keep a finger on the pulse of our customers,\nour readers, and the WordPress community in general.\n\nFor example, last year at this time we were talking to you about the potential\nimpact **cryptocurrencies** and **NFTs** might have on WordPress.\n\nSome of us were looking at ways to enable crypto payments for subscriptions.\nAnd others were considering how we might leverage NFTs to unlock content with\nMemberPress.\n\nThen crypto took a dive, and we stopped hearing much about it.\n\nJust as suddenly, we\u2019ve been hearing about the wonders of **ChatGPT and its\nmaker, OpenAI**.\n\nAs always when something this awesome comes along, we\u2019ve been busy kicking the\ntires, trying to learn all about it. More specifically, we\u2019ve been figuring\nout how it might benefit WordPress and MemberPress creators.\n\nThis **ChatGPT WordPress guide** is the result.\n\nBut before we get to the guide, we wanted to let you know about something\n_extra-awesome_ that\u2019s come out of the tire-kicking process\u2026\n\n## The MemberPress ChatGPT Integration\n\nWATCH >> the memberpress chatgpt integration puts your memberpress-powered\nwordpress site to work.\n\nYep! Thanks to our friends at Uncanny Automator, the **MemberPress ChatGPT\nintegration** is alive, kicking, and ready to help you take content creation\nby storm \u2013 right inside MemberPress.\n\nThis ChatGPT WordPress guide is geared toward **use within WordPress in\ngeneral** , but we\u2019ve thrown in a few MemberPress-specific details throughout.\n\nBefore we dive in, we want to talk about how **AI\u2019s impact on digital business\nfar outweighs what crypto promises to bring**. At least in the near future.\n\nAfter all, as a digital entrepreneur, your energies are limited. So here\u2019s why\nyou might want to focus those energies on incorporating AI over crypto for the\ntime being\u2026\n\n## AI Promises a Bigger Impact Than Crypto\n\nChatGPT and the technology behind it have a real potential to **transform\ndigital publishing as we know it**.\n\nAs you probably know, AI and machine learning technology have been around for\na while.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been using it to develop new medicines for\nyears. Big tech companies have been using machine learning to develop\nalgorithms for ages.\n\nSo, why is something like ChatGPT suddenly such a big deal, being touted as\nhaving all this massive potential for small businesses?\n\nWell, just think about the calculator watch\u2026\n\nLong before middle schoolers figured out they could use that tech to sabotage\nmath class scantrons, scientists were using it to launch megaton payloads into\nspace.\n\nAnd so it is with AI today. From the confines of Big Tech think tanks and drug\ncompany research labs, AI has found its way to middle schoolers\u2019 essay\nassignments.\n\nBut, _unlike_ crypto, AI has also found its way to content creation \u2013 and that\nmatters big time for small businesses in terms of **time-saving (and money-\nsaving) potential**.\n\nSo while we\u2019re all waiting for crypto to figure itself out, we\u2019re much better\noff investing our time in learning how AI can help build our businesses.\n\nThat being said\u2026\n\n## How Do You Use ChatGPT with WordPress?\n\nWATCH >>> How to automate tasks between chatgpt, wordpress, and memberpress\nwith uncanny automator\n\nYou might be wondering what all this has to do with WordPress.\n\n**Frankly, AI makesproducing high-quality content for your WordPress site\nfaster, easier, and more affordable. **\n\nWill it replace copywriters and content creators? Nope. After all, we still\nhave \u2013 and love \u2013 our math teachers.\n\nBut what it _will_ do is make the \u201cdreaded blank page\u201d a thing of the past.\nAnd what it _can_ do is make things like customer service way faster and more\naffordable.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the **ultimate guide to using ChatGPT on your WordPress website**.\nWhether you use MemberPress or not, you\u2019ll find some innovative ways to\nincorporate AI into your content planning and publishing process.\n\n### A Few Points\u2026\n\nThis guide is intended to be the most useful thing you\u2019ll read on the topic of\nWordPress ChatGPT.\n\n_**I\u2019ll actually be using ChatGPT to generate some of the content**_ **_in\nthis guide_**. And I\u2019ll show you exactly where I\u2019m using the bot.\n\nThus far, 100% of the content you\u2019ve read here is written by me with no\nassistance from AI.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re aware of what ChatGPT is\nalready. So, we\u2019ll dive right into the various ways you can incorporate it\ninto your website today.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the most obvious use of the OpenAI product for blogging \u2013\nwriting a blog post.\n\n## Using ChatGPT to Write an Amazing Blog Post on WordPress\n\nYou might be surprised to learn how many blogs are using ChatGPT to churn out\ntons of new posts. But you must **proceed with caution**.\n\nIf you just copy and paste from the tool, you could end up destroying your\nblog. As it turns out, there are a number of ways to **ensure you\u2019re using the\ntool as a resource and not a shortcut**.\n\n### It\u2019s All About the Prompt\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d Well, one\nchallenge is that ChatGPT can output decent responses, even when you feed it\ngarbage.\n\nAnd some bloggers may be tempted to just use the output generated with a lazy\nprompt. Unfortunately, content generated this way tends to lack personality.\nIt can feel very plain and boring.\n\nchatgpt is eager to please.\n\nSuccessful use of AI begins with a **well-crafted prompt**. It\u2019s so important,\ncompanies are paying massive salaries for what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cprompt\nengineering\u201d.\n\nSome prompt-engineering positions come with salaries as high as $335k!\n\nSo, let\u2019s fire up ChatGPT and ask it for help generating a great prompt!\nYou\u2019ll need to create an account the first time. But they\u2019ve made that easy.\nYou can log in with your Google account.\n\n5 tips for creating prompts in Chatgpt, generated by (you guessed it) chatgpt.\n\n### How to Create the Best Prompts for ChatGPT\n\nAs you can see here, by simply asking the bot to teach me how to craft\nexcellent prompts, I receive the following helpful tips:\n\n  1. **Be clear and concise**\n  2. **Specify your question or topic**\n  3. **Use open-ended questions**\n  4. **Provide context**\n  5. **Be respectful**\n\nI\u2019ve found that **the most important tips are third and fourth on the list**.\nWhile my prompt here is open-ended, I could improve it by adding some context\nabout the reason for the request.\n\nI could add information about what my role is, for example. Adding **context**\nimproves the output from ChatGPT.\n\n### Useful Content Creation Prompts for ChatGPT\n\nThe more you experiment with prompting an AI chatbot, the better you\u2019ll get.\nHere are some ChatGPT prompt ideas to get you started.\n\n  * **Suggest X post titles for my blog about Y** \u2013 This prompt will give you a number of creative suggestions related specifically to your blog topic  \n\n  * **Create three email subject lines to promote my latest course titled [your course name]** \u2013 email marketing prompts can streamline your marketing and help you drive traffic and conversions to your online courses  \n\n  * **As a sales professional, explain the benefits of [your product or service]** \u2013 you can have a lot of creative fun with this one  \n\n  * **Suggest metaphors for [your product] and [your target customer]** \u2013 In our case, this prompt might say \u201csuggest metaphors for MemberPress and 7-figure creators\u201d  \n\n  * **Translate the following features into benefits** \u2013 This prompt will really get the creativity flowing and improve how you communicate the benefits of your product or service  \n\n  * **Analyze the following text sample for style and tone** \u2013 This is how you can inform ChatGPT about your preferred writing tone and style\n\nMake sure to expand on your prompt to give context to ChatGPT. For example, if\nyou want ChatGPT to suggest blog titles, you\u2019ll want to include information on\nthe target audience and how you want them to feel.\n\nOnce enabled, every time you write a prompt, Prompt Enhancer will generate a\nmore detailed version. It then instructs you to copy and paste the new version\ninto the chat, and edit it so that it better suits your brief.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of Prompt Enhancer in action:\n\nPrompt Enhancer is just one of a growing list of ChatGPT plugins that can help\nyou perfect ChatGPT\u2019s outputs and streamline your workflow.\n\n#### How To Enable ChatGPT Plugins\n\nPlugins are currently a beta ChatGPT feature available to Plus users.\n\nTo enable plugins, log into ChatGPT, click on your name in the bottom left\ncorner, and go to **Setting** s > **Beta features** and enable the **Plugins**\ntoggle.\n\nThen open a **New Chat** , and you\u2019ll notice that at the top it says **No\nplugins enabled**. Click on it and navigate to the **Plugin store**.\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll be able to find a whole range of useful tools for you to\ninstall and use on ChatGPT.\n\n### Make The Most of ChatGPT Plugins\n\nThere are several ChatGPT plugins that can help you perfect your prompts and\nprovide context. One that I particularly like is called Prompt Enhancer by\nAISEO.\n\n### Use ChatGPT to Brainstorm WordPress Blog Post Ideas\n\nNow that you know what it takes to write useful prompts, you\u2019re ready to start\n**generating some ideas for blog posts**.\n\nJust look at the results you can get when you feed it a high-quality prompt:\n\nExcellent wordpress blog post ideas generated by chatgpt\n\nCheck out those suggestions!\n\nIf you were planning a vacation to the Northwest, do you think these posts\nmight interest you?\n\nProceed with caution though. It can be tempting to just ask ChatGPT to _\u201cWrite\na blog post for suggestion number one in the list\u201d._ The AI could do it, but\nit wouldn\u2019t be altogether good.\n\n### Creating a Blog Post Outline with ChatGPT\n\nThis is where using AI for blog posts gets really fun. And the bot is really\nimpressive with this task.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some post ideas, start prompting ChatGPT to suggest some\nheadings and a rough outline for your post.\n\nFor this example, I\u2019m going to ask ChatGPT to **create a blog post outline**\nfor my post about finding a great place to pick Huckleberries in Western\nMontana.\n\nI\u2019ll incorporate what we\u2019ve already learned about crafting a great prompt.\nCheck this out.\n\nexample of a blog post outline generated by chatgpt\n\nPretty slick, isn\u2019t it?\n\nA post that followed this outline would definitely be helpful content for the\nintended audience.\n\nHow much time do you think ChatGPT just saved a blogger with this outline\ncreation? From this point, I could either begin writing the post. Or I could\nhand it off to my copywriter and let them work their magic.\n\n## How to Integrate ChatGPT with WordPress\n\nOkay, that was all really cool stuff, right? Well, buckle up! I\u2019m about to\nturn the _helpfulness_ meter up to max capacity.\n\nLet\u2019s transform your content planning by connecting your WordPress site with\nChatGPT. There are a number of ways to do it. And tech-savvy folks have been\ndoing it for the past few months now.\n\n### Get MemberPress Today!\n\nThen kick off your online business with an **AI edge**. The MemberPress\nChatGPT integration is HERE!\n\nGet MemberPress Now  See All Features\n\nThere are a few plugins that can connect OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to WordPress.\n\nFor the most part, these plugins simply allow you to prompt the AI model from\nwithin WordPress, and then display responses in the WordPress admin area. From\nthere you can copy and paste the content where you need it.\n\nWhile that\u2019s a step in the right direction, I\u2019m more interested in **using\nChatGPT to automate routine tasks.**\n\nWe\u2019ve been using **Uncanny Automator** here at MemberPress for a while to help\nus automate common tasks.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Uncanny Automator, it\u2019s the **best automation and\nintegration tool for WordPress** \u2013 and an excellent alternative to platforms\nlike Zapier.\n\nThat\u2019s because Uncanny Automator lives right in your WordPress admin as a\nplugin, letting you build your automations right inside WordPress.\n\nWe\u2019ve also been impressed with the _hundreds_ of integrations available (and,\nof course, the fact that Uncanny Automator integrates directly with\nMemberPress).\n\nSo, to get started using ChatGPT with WordPress, you\u2019ll want to\u2026\n\n### Install the Uncanny Automator Plugin\n\nIn the Uncanny Automator plugin, automations are controlled by **Recipes**.\n\nA recipe is a collection of triggers and actions that accomplish a desired\noutcome (we\u2019ll get into that shortly).\n\nFor now, you\u2019ll need to connect Automator to your OpenAI account.\n\n### Connecting Uncanny Automator to OpenAI\n\nCONNECT CHATGPT TO WORDPRESS WITH UNCANNY AUTOMATOR\n\nOnce you\u2019ve installed and activated the plugin, navigate to the **Automator**\nmenu in the WordPress Admin area, and select the menu item named\n**Integrations**.\n\nHere you\u2019ll see options to integrate with most of the other plugins already\nactivated on your site. For example, **MemberPress customers will see the\nMemberPress logo as a trigger option.**\n\nScroll down until you see the icon for OpenAI. It\u2019ll be grayed out until you\nconnect. To do that, you\u2019ll need to generate an API secret in your OpenAI\naccount.\n\n### Creating Your First Recipe for ChatGPT\n\nCooking up recipes with uncanny automator is fun stuff!\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to get cooking. Go to the **Recipes** section of Automator,\nand click to create your first recipe.\n\n  1. **Select the plugin you\u2019d like to trigger the automation with**\n  2. **Create the action(s) that should happen each time the trigger runs**\n  3. **Make sure both your trigger and action are enabled**\n  4. **Enable the recipe**\n  5. **Test your automation by taking an action that should activate your trigger**\n  6. **Check the Automator logs to ensure the automation ran as expected**\n\nThese recipes can be very powerful, and there\u2019s _so much_ you can do with\nthem. Let me show you some innovative ways to use this new integration.\n\n## Create Custom GPTs to Streamline Even Further\n\nRecently, OpenAI released an incredible feature for Plus users (currently in\nBeta) to save _even more_ time \u2013 My GPTs.\n\nIf you\u2019re continually using ChatGPT for the same tasks, you can train your\nvery own specialized models for each one. This nifty feature means you can\nbypass having to write out the same prompts over and over \u2013 which quickly gets\ntedious!\n\nWith Custom GPTs you can also upload whole documents for ChatGPT to process\nand use in its responses.\n\nAs with everything in ChatGPT, this feature is super easy to use.\n\nJust click on your profile at the bottom left of the screen, and hit **My\nGPTs**.\n\nThere you will be able to\u2026\n\n  * Create your custom GPT\n  * View your previously created GPTs\n  * Browse public GPTs created by other Open.ai users. \n\nClick **Create a GPT** to get started.\n\nThen ChatGPT will guide you through the process of creating your GPT in the\npanel on the left.\n\nIn the example above, we\u2019re using MyGPT to create a chatbot for WordPress\ntroubleshooting. ChatGPT suggests a name (WordPress Buddy), creates a profile\npicture, and asks you questions to help you refine your model.\n\nThe panel on the right is your playground to test out your model and spot\nopportunities to improve it.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, hit **Save** at the top right of your screen. At this point\nyou can choose whether you want to make your new GPT available to the public,\nonly you, or to anyone with a link. Hit **Confirm** and you\u2019re all set!\n\nNow your GPT will be easily accessible in your side panel. You can make edits\nto your GPT at any time. Simply click on the GPT you want to edit, click on\nthe name of the GPT at the top left of the main panel, and select **Edit\nGPT.**\n\nFor a bit of inspiration, check out this list of popular Custom GPT\u2019s\nspecifically for marketers and entrepreneurs.\n\n## Automatically Create Blog Post Outlines for WordPress with ChatGPT\n\nAt MemberPress, the entire team contributes to our blog, and anyone can submit\na blog post idea to our copywriting team.\n\nFor example, when our support team receives similar questions from multiple\ncustomers, they can tip off our Content Team on the potential for a blog post\nor \u201chow-to\u201d video.\n\nOur team uses a **post-submission form** to forward these ideas to the\nwriters. We designed the form so that it\u2019d gather all the details and context\ncopywriters might need to write an amazing post.\n\nWith Uncanny Automator, we put this process on autopilot. Here\u2019s how\u2026\n\n### Go from post _idea_ to full-fledged _outline_ \u2013 automatically\n\nTo create a **super-powered idea-submission form** , you just use **Uncanny\nAutomator** to connect:\n\n  * **Formidable Forms** (or any form builder)\n  * OpenAI ( **ChatGPT** )\n  * **WordPress**\n\nFirst, you **build an idea-submission form** with open fields for details. For\nexample, for my Western Montana Huckleberry Picking example above, I could put\ntogether a form with these fields:\n\n_**What do you want this post to be about?**_ >> [main content topic]  \n _ **What do you want this post to help readers do?**_ >> [content purpose]  \n ** _What specific points do you want to address?_ **>> [talking points\nseparated by commas]\n\nThen I\u2019d set up a **prompt template in ChatGPT** looking something like this:\n\n_**Please create an outline for a blog post about**_ [main content topic] _\n**. The post will help our readers** _[content purpose] _._ ** _The outline\nshould address the following:_** [talking points separated by commas] **.**\n\nFinally, I\u2019d **create anUncanny Automator recipe** to direct the following\nautomatic process:\n\n  1. Form is submitted to **Formidable Forms**.\n  2. **ChatGPT** receives the form, generates a prompt, and creates a post outline **.**\n  3. **WordPress** receives the outline and flows it into a new post draft.\n\nThe end result? A perfectly crafted draft post outline ready and waiting for\nyou (or your copywriter). The time-saving potential is undeniable!\n\n#### But keep in mind\u2026\n\n**The human element is still critical**. The goal of content is to give value\nto your readers. So unless you aren\u2019t too concerned about quality, the bot\ncan\u2019t replace your copywriters.\n\nAs I said, ChatGPT _could_ write my whole Huckleberry post for me. But my goal\nwas to elicit an emotional response from my readers.\n\nTo get that kind of response out of bot content would require quite a bit of\nresearch and editing.\n\n## How to Create a Course Using ChatGPT\n\nmemberpress creator cheryl malik uses the courses add-on to create online\ncourses for 40 aprons.\n\nWe just reviewed an awesome way ChatGPT can help you create blog posts. I\nshowed you how to transform a blog post idea into a workable outline using AI\nand automation.\n\nWell, guess what? It gets even better\u2026\n\nThanks to the MemberPress ChatGPT integration, you can do the same thing with\nMemberPress Courses!\n\nTo create a **complete course outline** in MemberPress with ChatGPT, here\u2019s\nwhat you do\u2026\n\nFirst, build an internal form designed to capture course topics and\nobjectives. Then build an **Uncanny Automator recipe** that\u2019ll direct this\nprocess:\n\n  1. **Form is submitted**\n  2. **ChatGPT receives the form as a prompt to generate a course outline**\n  3. **MemberPress Courses receives the outline as a new course draft**\n\nUsing your content creation skills, you can finalize and build out the course\ncontent following the AI outline. Major time-saver!\n\n### Go from _topic_ to _complete course outline_ \u2013 in a flash\n\nIn my example recipe I\u2019ll use **Formidable Forms**. But you can also use other\npopular plugins, like WPForms, to set your trigger.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the available form integrations as of the writing of\nthis post.\n\navailable wordpress form integrations for Uncanny automator\n\nSince ChatGPT will use the form submissions to populate your prompt, make sure\nyou have **relevant form fields**.\n\nFor example, my form includes fields for _course topic_ and _course\nobjectives._ The more detail you capture in your form, the better you can\nprompt ChatGPT.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a screenshot of my sample recipe in Uncanny Automator. **Note that\nI\u2019m using the action to _Create a Post_ in WordPress.**\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m not using _MemberPress Courses_ in the\naction, it\u2019s because **MemberPress uses a** **custom post type for courses**.\nSo I just need to select the **correct post type** to create my recipe.\n\nThe image below shows exactly how to configure your action to create a\nMemberPress course.\n\ncreate a COURSE IN memberpress with AN uncanny automator recipe\n\n* * *\n\nAs you can see, the time-saving potential is absolutely enormous when it comes\nto content creation and AI. But what\u2019s even more incredible is that you can\nuse this tech to **supercharge your customer service** too.\n\nHere\u2019s one of the many ways\u2026\n\n## Reply to WordPress Blog Comments with ChatGPT\n\nThis one can really streamline your customer relationships and your blog\nmanagement process.\n\nWith the **WordPressUncanny Automator integration**, I was able to create a\nrecipe that generates automated responses to approved comments on my sandbox\nsite.\n\n* * *\n\n_**Disclaimer Time**_\n\n_We\u2019re not doing this at MemberPress, by the way._\n\n_And this is actually where things get a little tricky for me, personally (and\nas the MemberPress Growth Manager)._\n\n_I prefer authentic engagement with humans. I think a person who decides to\ncomment on this post might feel a bit put off to learn they were responded to\nby a bot. So, let me be clear: **Real humans are manually replying to comments\non our posts.** _\n\n* * *\n\nBut that being said\u2026 no judgment here.\n\nAfter all, startups can be terribly short on resources. A comment-responding\nchatbot in the early days could be just the time-saver you need to get things\noff the ground.\n\nPlus, there are certainly **ethical ways to use ChatGPT** to _streamline_ the\ncomment-response process \u2013 even for the big guys.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt. AI really shines when it comes to idea generation and\ncreative prompting. So, why not use ChatGPT to provide suggestions for\nreplies?\n\n### Go from _tongue-tied_ to _fully replied_ \u2013 in an instant\n\nTo get great response suggestions on post comments, create the following\nrecipe:\n\nuncanny automator recipe for wordpress comment replies with chatgpt\n\nI posted a couple of sample comments on the post to test the integration\nrecipe. Take a look below, and you be the judge.\n\nHow about these test responses?\n\nactual blog post comments written by chatgpt\n\nPretty great, right?\n\nGiven these responses, we could go in, read the user\u2019s comment, then make a\nfew edits to add a personal touch, and we\u2019re done!\n\n* * *\n\n_It\u2019s important to note that the current version of theUncanny Automator\nWordPress integration doesn\u2019t support threaded comments. _\n\n_TheUncanny Team has expressed some interest in adding support for threaded\ncomments. But I\u2019m not sure it ought to be a high priority. Do we even want\nbots replying to blog comments? Just something to think about._\n\n* * *\n\n## More Ways to Use ChatGPT with WordPress\n\nAre you sitting down? If not, you might want to lower the fancy stand-up desk,\nand have a seat for this next part.\n\nNow that you have a firm grasp on how to use OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT tool for content\ncreation, it\u2019s time to expand. So here are a few additional ways you can use\nChatGPT with WordPress.\n\n### ChatGPT Can Organize Your Membership Levels\n\nThis is a common question we hear from business owners wanting to add a\nmembership component to their businesses:\n\n_How can I organize all the benefits into meaningful membership levels?_\n\nAnd here\u2019s a new, awesome answer: _Let ChatGPT help you._\n\nAll you have to do is\u2026\n\n  1. **Prompt the AI with a complete list of all the features and benefits you want to offer.**\n  2. **Let it know how many tiers you\u2019d like to have.**\n  3. **Give the prompt some context.**\n\nHere\u2019s what my prompts would like if I were to build a membership business\naround my hobby of wild Huckleberry picking.\n\nexample of a well-crafted chatgpt prompt\n\nThe beauty here is that you can actually instruct the bot to format its\nresponse in a **useful** way.\n\nIn my case, that would be a **table**. Here\u2019s what ChatGPT came up with when I\ntried it out.\n\nchatgpt organized my membership features into a table for me.\n\nWith a few edits, you can even use this chart on your site\u2019s pricing page to\ngive customers a rundown on what each membership or plan tier includes.\n\n### Use ChatGPT to Create Page Content\n\nYou\u2019ve probably already realized this. But everything you\u2019ve learned here\nabout blog content creation can be applied to **virtually any type of content\non WordPress**.\n\nIt all comes down to your prompt. Make sure to tell the AI about your goals,\nand give it good details to work with.\n\nHow about a _homepage_? Maybe you need an _about us_ or _features_ page. Or\nwhat about a side-by-side product comparison?\n\nReally, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\n### Use ChatGPT for Coding in WordPress\n\nThis one requires a bit of **caution**.\n\nJust like you want a copywriter or editor (or even just a human) to review\nyour text content, you don\u2019t want to blindly copy/paste code generated by\nChatGPT. It\u2019s a good idea to have a trusted WordPress developer review any\ncode you get.\n\nBut as with all things content, ChatGPT code can **help you get started** in\nmajor ways with minor things. I tested this with MemberPress recently. The\nresult was very intriguing, although it didn\u2019t completely resolve the problem.\n\nSo, what I\u2019m going to show you here doesn\u2019t necessarily accomplish the end\ngoal. Keep that in mind.\n\n#### Kickstart your coding\n\nNew-user approval is a feature request we\u2019ve heard from a few MemberPress\ncustomers.\n\nSome customers want to keep new members in a pending status where they can\nmanually review and approve. And they want this to happen prior to processing\nthe membership payment.\n\nWhile there _is_ a third party plugin that does this (New User Approve), I\nwanted to see what ChatGPT could do.\n\nChatgpt generated code for a wordpress membership website\n\nI didn\u2019t include the actual code generated by ChatGPT. Additional processes\nneed to happen within Stripe for this code to process the payment once I\napprove the user. So, it\u2019s not complete.\n\nBut this example of how you can use ChatGPT to create WordPress code should\nget you thinking of the possibilities.\n\nSome developers have even used ChatGPT to write entire WordPress plugins!\n\n### Improve Abandoned Cart Emails with ChatGPT\n\nHave you ever received an abandoned cart email? They\u2019re pretty boring, right?\n\nSince Uncanny Automator integrates with the major email marketing applications\nas well as WordPress, you can dial those emails up a notch. Just use Uncanny\nto connect OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to your abandoned cart email automations.\n\nFor example, you could **create a recipe that populates custom email content\nright into the abandoned cart email** in ActiveCampaign.\n\nEven get creative! Use the **\u201cwrite a poem\u201d prompt**. Or maybe **country\nmusic** is your thing (it is for ChatGPT).\n\nbrad paisley, is that you?\n\nIt\u2019s even okay if you want to go the straight-laced route.\n\nIn either case, ChatGPT can save you a whole lot of time when it comes to\ncreating the kind of **meaningful email content that keeps customers coming\nback**.\n\n## Wrapping Up The ChatGPT WordPress Guide\n\nSo, there you have it. And it\u2019s really only the beginning!\n\nAs you can see, ChatGPT may not replace all the people (and that\u2019s good!).
