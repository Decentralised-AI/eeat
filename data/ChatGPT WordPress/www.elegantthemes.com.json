With the chops to help you craft outlines, headlines,\nparagraphs, or full blog posts, digital creators everywhere are warming up to\nthe idea of creating content with artificial intelligence (AI). As AI\ncontinues to evolve, we see integration with ChatGPT in several ways,\nincluding within WordPress. In this post, we\u2019ll showcase how to use ChatGPT in\nWordPress.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n**Table Of Contents**\n\n  * 1 What is ChatGPT?\n  * 2 What is Generative AI?\n  * 3 Benefits of Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n  * 4 7 Use Cases for Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n    * 4.1 Researching Blog Post Ideas\n    * 4.2 Generating Outlines\n    * 4.3 Writing and Debugging Code\n    * 4.4 Creating Plugins\n    * 4.5 User Engagement\n    * 4.6 SEO Optimization\n    * 4.7 Generating Web Content\n  * 5 How to Use ChatGPT in WordPress: 2 Methods\n    * 5.1 Divi AI\n    * 5.2 AI Engine\n  * 6 Final Thoughts on Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n\n## What is ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT (or generative pre-trained transformers) is an AI chatbot, created by\nOpenAI, that makes humanlike dialog through natural language processing. It\ncan respond to questions, carry on conversations, and even write code for you.\nIt uses a form of artificial intelligence called generative AI, which is also\nused to create images, videos, music, and text.\n\n## What is Generative AI?\n\nGenerative AI is a unique form of artificial intelligence that learns from\nlarge amounts of data to produce high-quality text, images, and other forms of\nmedia. It uses deep learning, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),\nto learn from a dataset and generate new content based on that data. GANs are\nmade up of two systems: a discriminator and a generator.\n\nDuring training, the generator\u2019s job is to create new content to try and fool\nthe discriminator. The discriminator receives the data, processes it, and\ndetermines whether it\u2019s real. Initially, the generator could be better at\ncreating new content so the discriminator can easily spot the fake. As\ntraining progresses, the generator gets better at its job, eventually being\nable to fool the discriminator.\n\n## Benefits of Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n\n  \nSubscribe To Our Youtube Channel\n\nThere are several benefits to using ChatGPT within WordPress. First and\nforemost, it can save you a ton of time in the content creation process. With\nChatGPT, you can quickly write blog posts, product descriptions, and more\nwithin a few clicks. Another benefit of ChatGPT is increased customer\nengagement.\n\nAI chatbots answer common questions, personalize recommendations, and quickly\naccess information. Using ChatGPT as a live chat agent, you can provide\ncustomers with a service without hiring live agents to field questions. That\nsaid, there are plenty of other use cases for ChatGPT.\n\n## 7 Use Cases for Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n\nThere are a few ways to use ChatGPT within WordPress. It\u2019s great for\nresearching blog post ideas, generating outlines, writing code, and creating\nplugins. Here are a few tasks that ChatGPT can assist you within WordPress.\n\n### Researching Blog Post Ideas\n\nComing up with fresh blog post ideas can be a challenge. With ChatGPT\nintegrated into WordPress, you can brainstorm ideas by conversing with it. It\ncan suggest topics, trends, or even niche subjects, helping to overcome\nwriter\u2019s block and ensuring your blog has fresh content regularly.\n\n### Generating Outlines\n\nCrafting a well-structured blog post starts with an outline. ChatGPT can help\nyou build an online based on an idea, adding main points, subheadings, and key\npoints, allowing you to keep your thoughts organized and on track.\n\n### Writing and Debugging Code\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to add functionality to your site but don\u2019t have\ncoding knowledge, ChatGPT can help you write CSS, HTML, and even PHP. In\naddition, if you\u2019re experiencing an error and need help deciphering it, you\ncan plug error messages into ChatGPT to help identify the problem.\n\n### Creating Plugins\n\nIf you need your site to encompass functionality that isn\u2019t possible with\nexisting plugins, you can ask ChatGPT for help. It can assist you in creating\nplugins to handle several different tasks, from something simple as a link\nfinder to more complex functions like a mortgage calculator.\n\n### User Engagement\n\nChatGPT can increase user engagement through chatbots. You can integrate it to\noffer recommendations, answer questions, and assist in finding relevant\ncontent on your site. You can even use it to provide technical support should\nyou offer products and services.\n\n### SEO Optimization\n\nOne of the most important ways to ensure your site gets noticed in the search\nengine ranking pages (SERPs) is by using an SEO plugin. Did you know that one\nof the more popular ones, AIOSEO, uses ChatGPT? With AIOSEO, you can use\nChatGPT to generate titles and meta descriptions, making your life much\neasier.\n\n### Generating Web Content\n\nWriting high-quality, engaging content is a time-consuming task. ChatGPT can\naid in writing content for your site, saving you time and effort. It\u2019s perfect\nfor crafting headlines, paragraphs, or entire landing pages.\n\n## How to Use ChatGPT in WordPress: 2 Methods\n\nThere are many ways to use ChatGPT for your website, but most involve using\nOpenAI\u2019s interface to do it. In this post, we want to concentrate on ways to\nuse ChatGPT within WordPress itself. The first is through Divi AI, which\nallows you to generate text (and images) when building pages in the Divi\nBuilder. The second is through a WordPress plugin called AI Engine.\n\n### Divi AI\n\nElegant Themes\u2019 new flagship AI product, Divi AI, incorporates ChatGPT (3.5)\ninside the Visual Builder, so you can generate text on the fly. It can also be\nused to build a webpage, write a blog post, or simply improve copy you\u2019ve\nalready written.\n\nYou can use Divi AI to create posts or pages, but for this post, we\u2019ll create\na page. Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard, then create a new page to\nstart using Divi AI with ChatGPT.\n\nNext, give your page a **title** (1), then click the **Use Divi Builder**\nbutton (2).\n\nYou can create a new page from scratch or choose a premade layout. We\u2019ll\nchoose to build our page with a premade layout:\n\nSelect the ramen shop layout pack for Divi:\n\nNext, choose the **landing page** layout (1), then click the **Use This\nLayout** button (2).\n\nWith the layout loaded, we can start using Divi AI to generate copy for our\npage.\n\n#### Divi AI: Generating Copy Automatically with ChatGPT\n\nOne of the fastest ways to use ChatGPT in WordPress is to generate copy\nautomatically. Divi AI uses proprietary technology combined with ChatGPT that\ngives Divi unique insight into the content you want to create. Divi AI can\nexamine surrounding content and make suggestions when using a pre-made layout\nor previously built page. To showcase this, select the text box under the page\ntitle by hovering over it to reveal the gray settings icon.\n\nClick it to bring up the module settings. You\u2019ll have two options to create\ncopy with Divi AI. If you want to automatically generate copy for your module,\nclick the **Generate Content With AI** button (1). Alternatively, you can\nhover over the text area to reveal the **AI icon** (2).\n\nUpon clicking the Generate Content With AI button, a new dialog box will\nappear with AI-generated text. As you can see, it used other elements within\nthe layout pack to create copy directly associated with the content on the\npage.\n\nTo use the text, click the **Use This Text** button to insert the newly\ngenerated text into the text module.\n\n#### Improving Copy with Divi AI\n\nWhat if you want to improve the text? Thankfully, Divi AI lets you make\nimprovements to copy just as easily. With the same text module activated,\nclick the **AI icon** within the text box to bring up the options. As you can\nsee, there are quite a few to choose from.\n\nLet\u2019s choose **Improve with AI**. A new dialog box will appear, revealing a\nfew options:\n\n  1. **Content Type:** Choose from a title, paragraph, button, blog post, or social media post.\n  2. **What are you writing about:** Allows you to provide context to give Divi AI a better shot at producing what you want.\n  3. **Added context:** Choose from this page content, this section content, this module content, or no context.\n  4. **Tone of voice:** Allows you to provide the tone for ChatGPT to follow, including creative, informative, or funny.\n  5. **Must use keywords:** Add keywords (short or long tail) that you\u2019d like included in the text.\n  6. **Content length:** Specify how many words, characters, sentences, paragraphs, or list items you want to generate.\n  7. **Language:** Choose the language for your text.\n\nThese settings allow you to fine-tune copy generated with Divi AI or written\nby a human. The great thing about ChatGPT within Divi AI is that you can guide\nit using keywords and other settings to produce content more attuned to your\nneeds. For example, suppose we want to shorten the content created in the last\nsection. In that case, we can easily specify how many words we\u2019d like the text\nto have.\n\n### AI Engine\n\nAnother good way to use ChatGPT in WordPress is through a WordPress AI plugin\ncalled AI Engine. It allows you to create chatbots, generate blog post ideas,\nand create images. To use AI Engine, you\u2019ll need to obtain an API key through\nOpenAI and purchase credits. In our experience, generating a three-paragraph\nblog post will cost roughly a fraction of a penny, so it\u2019s very cost-\neffective. Before we walk you through using AI Engine, let\u2019s get you set up\nwith an API Key.\n\n#### Setting up AI Engine\n\nAfter searching for and installing AI Engine, the first step is getting the\nsettings squared away. Before you do anything else, you\u2019ll need to acquire an\nAPI key through OpenAI. To do this, click on the settings tab in the AI Engine\ninterface.\n\nBefore proceeding to the next step, be sure that you sign in (1) to an active\nOpenAI account and have purchased credits. If you need to sign up, click the\n**sign up** button (2) on the top right of the OpenAI website.\n\nTo add credits, navigate to the billing overview screen and click the add to\ncredit balance button to add credits to your account.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve purchased credits, click **API keys** (1) under the user tab. From\nthere, click **\\+ Create new secret key** (2).\n\nNext, give your API key a **name** (1) and click **Create secret key** (2).\n\nOnce the key is created, click the **copy button** to copy the key to your\npasteboard.\n\nFinally, head to the AI Engine settings screen and paste your new API key into\nthe text field.\n\n#### AI Engine Content Generator Settings\n\nNow that AI Engine is set up, we can start generating content. Start by\nclicking the content tab at the top right of your screen.\n\nOnce your screen refreshes, you\u2019ll be taken to the AI Engine content\ngenerator. Here, you can easily use it to create content for your site,\nemails, or even code. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the interface:\n\n  1. **Topic:** Start by adding a topic for the content you want to generate.\n  2. **Templates:** Create new templates based on current settings.\n  3. **Title:** Insert a title for your content. Alternatively, you can use the topic box to create one for you.\n  4. **Sections:** Input text to rewrite it using ChatGPT, or have the AI generate it for you.\n  5. **Content:** The body of your content.\n  6. **Excerpt:** Used to generate a post excerpt.\n  7. Select between posts and pages.\n  8. Create Post button.\n  9. **Content parameters:** Includes a language selector, writing style, and writing tone for your content.\n  10. **Post Parameters:** Choose between posts and pages.\n  11. **Model Parameters:** Set the temperature, max tokens, and model.\n  12. **Prompts:** Shows the prompts used, along with variables. Prompts are saved in templates for reuse.\n  13. **Usage Cost:** Allows you to see the cost of the current generation.\n\n#### Generating Content With AI Engine\n\nNow that you are familiar with the settings in the content generator, we\u2019ll\ndemonstrate how easy it is to create a blog post with AI Engine. Start by\nadding the following topic: _How to Make Money with ChatGPT_. Then click the\n**Generate** button.\n\nAfter clicking the generate button, AI Engine will enter a title based on the\ntopic you entered. The next step is to create sections. Choose the number of\nsections you\u2019d like. For this tutorial, we\u2019ll set the number of sections to 3.\nThen click the generate sections button. ChatGPT will create them and add them\nto the page.\n\nNext, choose how many paragraphs you\u2019d like to generate per section, then\nclick **generate content**. We\u2019ll add two paragraphs per section here.\nDepending on how many you choose to create, it could take up to a couple of\nminutes.\n\nThen, you can generate an excerpt for your post based on the surrounding\ncontent.\n\nFinally, choose whether you want your new content added as a post or a page.\nWe\u2019ll select **posts** (1), then click the **create post** (2) button.\n\nYour new post will be created as a draft, so you can go in and make edits, add\nimages, and publish it at your convenience.\n\n#### Adding a Chatbot to WordPress\n\nAnother cool feature of AI Engine is the ability to create a chatbot to\ndisplay on your website. It only takes a few minutes and can help with\ncustomer engagement by answering questions, pointing customers to a specific\nproduct or service, and more.\n\nBy default, AI Engine comes with a chatbot ready to integrate into your site,\nso to get it up and running, you can leave the settings as is and copy the\nshortcode to embed it wherever you wish. However, you can use some additional\nsettings to make it more functional. For example, you can set it as a popup,\nmake it full-screen, and style it to match your branding.\n\nWhether you need to generate copy for your website or incorporate a chatbot to\nhelp with customer service, AI Engine is a great way to incorporate ChatGPT in\nWordPress.\n\n## Final Thoughts on Using ChatGPT in WordPress\n\nThe emergence of ChatGPT has significantly changed how business owners and\ncreative professionals create content. It can handle many tasks, including\nmaking headlines and blog outlines to complete blog posts in minutes. The\nintegration of ChatGPT in WordPress through breakthrough generative AI tools\nlike Divi AI and WordPress plugins like AI Engine, stand to change the way we\nwork within WordPress. These tools empower creators to efficiently generate\nhigh-quality content, enhance user engagement, optimize SEO, and more. As the\npartnership between the two advances, we should all look forward to the future\nof AI in WordPress.\n\nWould you like to learn more about using AI?
