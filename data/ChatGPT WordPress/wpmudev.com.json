To find out, we\nasked ChatGPT to build a custom WordPress plugin from scratch and then had our\ncrack team of developers examine the code\u2026\n\nAI is the world\u2019s most popular two-letter word right now. With all the recent\nnews headlines about whether AI will take our jobs away, we wanted to know\u2026\ncan ChatGPT actually develop a functional and useful WordPress plugin without\nhaving to write code from scratch? And does the plugin meet best coding\npractices?\n\nFortunately, WPMU DEV builds some of the most robust WordPress plugins in the\nworld, so we have plenty of expert WordPress plugin developers who can put\nChatGPT to the test.\n\nIn fact, if you take a stroll around our company\u2019s virtual corridors, you\ncan\u2019t help but bump into WordPress coders and developers. It seems everyone\naround here can look at a WordPress plugin and see PHP the way Neo sees the\nMatrix\u2019s digital rain code.\n\nWhat PHP code looks like to experienced WordPress plugin developers. Source:\nGiphy.com\n\nEveryone, that is \u2026 _except me!_\n\nI\u2019m just a blog writer with no coding skills and a burning desire to add\n\u201cprompt engineer\u201d to my CV.\n\nSo, in this post, we\u2019ll explore how to leverage the power of ChatGPT to build\na simple custom WordPress plugin quickly and securely, even if you lack\nextensive coding skills.\n\nWe\u2019ll do this by:\n\n1) Asking ChatGPT to generate the code for a useful plugin that we can test,\nand\n\n2) Running the code generated by ChatGPT past our team of professional plugin\ndevelopers so they can review it and provide their honest feedback.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover the following:\n\n  * Step 1 \u2013 Define the Plugin\u2019s Functionality\n  * Step 2 \u2013 Generate Code Snippets with ChatGPT\n  * Step 3 \u2013 Test the Custom Plugin\n  * Feedback from Our Expert Plugin Developers\n  * Can ChatGPT Turn You Into a WordPress Plugin Developer?\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Define the Plugin\u2019s Functionality\n\nBefore using ChatGPT to generate code, we need to have a clear understanding\nof the functionality we want our plugin to provide.\n\nThis starts by outlining the specific features, actions, or modifications\nwe\u2019ll want to achieve with our plugin. This will then help us generate\naccurate prompts for ChatGPT and ensure that our AI-generated code aligns with\nour desired outcomes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Generate Code Snippets with ChatGPT\n\nTo generate our code snippets using ChatGPT, we\u2019ll keep things simple (and\nfree) and use the freely available interface provided by OpenAI.\n\n### Take #1\u2026\n\n_Note:_ My first attempt at using ChatGPT to create a WordPress plugin from\nscratch was way too ambitious. I asked ChatGPT to build me a simple WordPress\n~~time-travel~~ _dummy text generating_ plugin, using the prompt below\u2026\n\nThis prompt will surely kick ChatGPT\u2019s WordPress plugin development tyres.\n\nAs someone who spends a lot of time writing WordPress tutorials, I often need\ndummy content to test plugins, create screenshots, etc.\n\nSo, I thought it would be great to model my AI-generated dummy content plugin\non a plugin I often use called FakerPress.\n\nChatGPT pushed back on my request and let me know that creating a fully\nfunctional WordPress plugin with all the features I requested was beyond the\nscope of a single response.\n\nHowever, it did offer to provide me with a basic template, guide me on how to\nimplement some of the features I mentioned, and even gave me instructions on\nhow to create a plugin directory and file\u2026\n\nMmm\u2026maybe my first attempt at creating a WordPress plugin was too ambitious!\n\nAt first, ChatGPT output code that looked quite impressive\u2026\n\nTo someone who knows \u2018zip\u2019 about coding, the above code snippet sure looks\nimpressive!\n\nChatGPT also output all the additional code required to complete the next\nsteps.\n\nLacking coding skills, I relied on ChatGPT to guide me through each step of\nthe plugin development process.\n\nWith the plugin code output, the next step was to upload the plugin to my test\nsite and test it to make sure it works.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Test The Custom Plugin\n\nAfter uploading the folder containing the plugin code to the `wp-content >\nplugins` directory of my test site and activating it inside the Plugins\nscreen\u2026\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for [drumroll]\u2026I got a fatal\nerror!\n\nWhat an anticlimax\u2026the lowest point of my WordPress plugin development career!\n\nAssuming that maybe I didn\u2019t add the additional snippets that ChatGPT provided\ncorrectly, I went back and asked for all the code to be provided as a single\nfile that I could simply copy and paste to overwrite and update the uploaded\nplugin file\u2026\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t it just have given me the entire copy and paste code the first\ntime?\n\nThere was a lot of code to output, so whenever the process came to a\nstandstill, I instructed ChatGPT to continue\u2026\n\nChatGPT sometimes just needs a little gentle encouragement to keep going.\n\nAfter repeating this process several times, ChatGPT output the entire code and\neven provided some helpful information.\n\nAfter waiting a whole 2 minutes\u2026ChatGPT finally output all of the plugin code!\n\nI uploaded the plugin file with the new code to my test site, then jumped into\nthe site\u2019s admin area and activated the plugin.\n\nIt worked! Or, so it seemed.\n\nChatGPT gave the plugin its own menu item\u2026\n\nChatGPT created all this!\n\nAnd a settings screen with lots of fancy boxes and fields\u2026\n\nLooks impressive\u2026but will it work?\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t see a field to specify how many posts or pages to create, so I\nsimply ticked some boxes, entered some values, and clicked on the \u201cSave\nChanges\u201d button to see what happens.\n\nAnd now, for the moment of truth\u2026\n\nAnd\u2026absolutely nothing happened!\n\nThe newest lowest point of my WordPress plugin development career\u2026a plugin\nthat does nothing!\n\nMy fancy-ass plugin was all make-believe, just like one of those children\u2019s\nplayground spaceships that\u2019s filled with useless knobs you can turn and\nbuttons you can press while pretending to be flying in outer space.\n\nSo, I reached out to one of our developers via Slack and asked them to look at\nthe plugin file.\n\nSome of the comments that came back included the following:\n\n  * \u201cThe plugin tries to generate random content on each and every admin page load\u201d\n  * \u201cIt calls a function `dummy_content_generator_generate_content_paragraphs` which, in turn, attempts to call `dummy_content_generator_get_random_paragraph` for every paragraph it tries to generate. The problem is that there is no `dummy_content_generator_get_random_paragraph` function.\n  * \u201cThe page loads to a point, then it errors out because there\u2019s more missing stuff\u201d\n  * \u201cOther than all the mentioned issues, there\u2019s no validation whatsoever, and no escaping of the output, which is terrible\u201d\n  * \u201cIn terms of having something as starting point, this is a very, very poor one. In terms of having a working plugin, this is nowhere near that\u201d\n\nAfter some back and forth discussions , it was deemed that there was quite a\nlot wrong with the plugin, that it would take a lot of work to fix it, and\nthey suggested I scrap the project.\n\nAt this point, however, I was too invested in my mission to simply abandon\neverything and give up. Recalling Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s famous words (\n~~\u201cFetch me another brandy\u201d~~ \u201cNever give in, never give in, never, never,\nnever\u2026\u201d), I decided it was time for\u2026\n\n### Take #2\u2026\n\nOk, so my first attempt to get ChatGPT to build a WordPress plugin from\nscratch was a dismal failure. This in itself provided some valuable insights\ninto ChatGPT\u2019s ability to perform complex coding tasks (or, as someone in the\nteam put it, \u201cyou can\u2019t code using ChatGPT without having extensive coding\nknowledge.\u201d)\n\nSo, for \u201cTake #2,\u201d I decided to try again with a simpler plugin request.\n\nGoing back to the drawing board, a genius lightbulb moment lit up in my\nmind\u2026why not ask ChatGPT to suggest ideas for simple WordPress plugins it\ncould then generate the code for?\n\nSo, that\u2019s what I did. Here\u2019s the prompt I promptly engineered\u2026\n\nMy genius prompt.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the list of suggested plugins ChatGPT replied with\u2026\n\nThe blueprint of my WordPress plugin empire.\n\nI liked the last suggestion, so I asked ChatGPT to generate the code for a\nfunctional content duplicator plugin, and it immediately went to work.\n\nThis is what a license to print money looks like!\n\nChatGPT generated the following code for the plugin in the blink of an eye:\n\n##### __FREE EBOOK\n\n##### Your step-by-step roadmap to a profitable web dev business.

Let\u2019s find out!\n\nHere are the post\u2019s menu options before activating the plugin\u2026\n\nA default post with default options.\n\nAfter activating the plugin\u2026\n\n\u201cActivate Content Duplicator\u201d \u2013 Sounds like a line from a Star Trek movie.\n\nSuccess!\n\nA gratuitous screenshot proving that the plugin successfully activated.\n\nThe plugin activated. But did it actually work?\n\nHere\u2019s my test post again (note that the plugin added a new \u201cDuplicate\u201d item\nto the menu after activation). I then clicked on \u201cDuplicate\u201d to see what\nhappens\u2026\n\nChatGPT even added a \u201cDuplicate\u201d menu item tooltip to the code!\n\nAnd a duplicate post was created!\n\nA duplicate of the original post.\n\nHere\u2019s the table of posts showing entries for the original and duplicated\npost.\n\nThe original post and its cloned version.\n\nI\u2019m sure that with better prompt engineering and some code tweaking, the\nplugin could have been significantly improved. For example, I would prefer if\nthe plugin set the post status of the newly-duplicated post to \u2018draft\u2019 instead\nof publishing it, but ChatGPT delivered a simple WordPress plugin that worked.\nIt was basic, but it did the job.\n\nThe last step was to ask someone who codes WordPress plugins for a living to\nscrutinize the code and get their opinion about using a tool like ChatGPT to\ncode plugins.\n\n## Feedback from Our Expert Plugin Developers\n\nShortly after uploading the plugin to one of our testing channels, I got a\nping from one of our developers. Here are some of the key points provided in\ntheir feedback:\n\n  * \u201cChatGPT et al are decent at answering questions you already know the answer to.\u201d\n  * \u201cI also used it in the past to build a simple plugin for me, but as long as I was giving more complex prompts, it started to mess things around, so eventually I manually debug the given code to work, cause else it\u2019d take ages for it to actually debug it line by line.\u201d\n  * \u201cBasically, it does what it says. However, it does what it says very literally. As in, it _will_ duplicate a post and its corresponding postmeta (custom) fields. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like it will propagate any taxonomies to the duplicated post (the plugin should copy and assign the same taxonomy terms, such as categories or tags, from the original post to the duplicated post).\u201d\n  * If I was to be super-nitpicky about this, I\u2019d also mention that it\u2019s not L10n-ready \u2013 there won\u2019t be an option to translate this plugin. But, that\u2019s just being very nitpicky \u2013 I don\u2019t really think, nor would I expect, a prompt-generated plugin to be generic enough to be needing something like that at all. To me, it is more of a \u201cvery specific problem domain\u201d kind of a thing, including the language used. At the end of the day, it does do what it says it will, which is very nice.\u201d\n\nIn addition to examining the WordPress plugin code generated by ChatGPT and\nproviding feedback as shown above, our developers also agreed with the\nfollowing key points after assessing ChatGPT\u2019s current capabilities to\ngenerate code:\n\n**1 \u2013 It\u2019s important to exercise caution and not blindly accept ChatGPT-\ngenerated code as correct.**\n\n  * ChatGPT can provide answers, but it\u2019s up to the user to assess whether the answer is correct or not.\n  * There is a risk of receiving incorrect or nonsensical answers from ChatGPT, both obvious and subtle.\n  * It\u2019s important to exercise caution and not blindly accept the generated code as correct.\n  * ChatGPT\u2019s output should be treated as autocomplete, making life easier but requiring caution and verification.\n\nThe ability to discern good code from bad or nonsensical code, however,\nimplies that\u2026\n\n**2 \u2013 Users should have sufficient knowledge and understanding of WordPress\nplugin development to evaluate and modify the generated code as needed.**\n\n  * ChatGPT can help simplify and expedite the process of building simple custom WordPress plugins, generate code snippets, and provide explanations. Anything more complex, however, requires plugin development experience and coding skills.\n  * Using ChatGPT without sufficient knowledge can lead to negative consequences or unreliable code.\n  * Relying solely on ChatGPT without critical thinking is similar to blindly copying the first answer from Stack Overflow (Stack Overflow threads provide more context, multiple answers, and feedback from other users, making it a more reliable resource, but Stack Overflow threads tend to be more generic, whereas ChatGPT can provide specific answers to individual queries).\n\n**3 \u2013 Utilizing other resources, such as WordPress documentation, tutorials,\nand community forums, alongside ChatGPT can provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of WordPress plugin development.**\n\n  * As you explore the possibilities of using ChatGPT for WordPress plugin development, it\u2019s valuable to engage with the WordPress community. Share your experiences, ask for feedback, and seek guidance from experienced developers. Participating in forums, attending WordPress meetups, or joining online communities can provide valuable insights and help you refine your plugin development process.\n  * Additionally, consider following WordPress security best practices to safeguard your website from potential vulnerabilities. ChatGPT can provide recommendations on security measures you can implement to protect your plugin.\n  * It\u2019s also essential to maintain a clear understanding of your desired functionality and thoroughly review and test the generated code and secure your custom plugins before deploying them to a production environment.\n\n## Can ChatGPT Turn You Into a WordPress Plugin Developer?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ve explored how you can utilize ChatGPT to build simple\ncustom WordPress plugins, even if you have limited coding experience.\n\nIn other articles, we\u2019ve seen that AI-powered tools like ChatGP can streamline\nyour workflow, boost productivity, and unlock new possibilities (check out our\nrecent article on ways that ChatGPT can help you as a WordPress developer).\n\nWhile there are over 60,000 free WordPress plugins available covering every\ntype of functionality you can imagine, sometimes you may need a custom\nsolution to meet a client\u2019s specific requirements.\n\nBeyond the core functionality of your plugin, you can also leverage ChatGPT to\ngenerate code for custom user interfaces. With its ability to understand\nprompts and generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets, you can create\nintuitive admin interfaces, front-end components, and interactive elements\nthat will enhance the user experience and allow you to deliver a polished\nfinal product.\n\nBy utilizing the language model\u2019s capabilities, you can generate code\nsnippets, optimize functionality, and create user-friendly interfaces.\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to understand the generated code, review and refine it,\nand thoroughly test your custom plugins before deploying them to your live\nwebsite.\n\nThe generated code may also require adjustments to align with coding\nstandards, naming conventions, or specific project requirements. This requires\na certain amount of coding knowledge and skills, as does optimizing the code\nand ensuring it follows WordPress coding guidelines for better\nmaintainability.\n\n_The bottom line:_\n\nHere are my findings after trying to get ChatGPT to code me a plugin from\nscratch:\n\n  1. I couldn\u2019t have gotten this done without the help of our experienced developers.\n  2. Using ChatGPT to generate code without coding knowledge is really challenging \u2013 it helps to know what you are doing :)\n  3. While ChatGPT is a powerful and valuable tool, it doesn\u2019t seem like AI will replace skilled coders any time soon.\n\n### Interested in Developing WordPress plugins?\n\nCheck out some of our tutorials and articles on WordPress plugin development:\n\n  * Getting Started with WordPress Plugin Development\n  * A Quick and In-Depth Guide to WordPress Hooks\n  * Creating WordPress Plugins in An Object Oriented Way\n\nHave you tried using AI tools like ChatGPT to build or customize a WordPress\nplugin?
