From the available information, it is evident that Corsi.it offers a single course on Microsoft Excel for €49.95 + IVA, while Lezione-online.it provides a variety of courses with prices ranging from €15.00 to €103.80.

Unfortunately, there is no pricing information available for other platforms such as Udemy, YouTube, and various others.

In conclusion, for individuals looking to start their journey in finance, Lezione-online.it seems to offer a wider range of courses at different price points compared to Corsi.it. However, the specific content and quality of the courses are also important factors to consider when making a decision.
