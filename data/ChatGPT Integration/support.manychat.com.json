It uses\nnatural language processing driven by AI technology. The tool can help\ndramatically improve your marketing efforts, from creating better and more\npersonalized customer experiences to saving a lot of time on customer support\nresponses. ChatGPT is very important for marketers and business owners who\nwant to improve their customers' experiences with their brand.\n\nIn this article, you will find information on how you can integrate ChatGPT\nwith Manychat and use this functionality.\n\n **How to Integrate your Chat GPT Account with Manychat**\n\n  1. First, you need a ChatGPT account. Go to the OpenAI website, and create an account by clicking the \"Get Started\" button.\n  2. Generate your API Keys by going to the API Keys tab and clicking \"Create New Secret Key\".  \n  \n\n  3. Next, go to Manychat -> Settings -> Integrations -> Connect ChatGPT Account.  \n\n  \n**How to use integration in Manychat?**\n\n  1. Go to the Automation tab and create a new Flow.\n  2. Create a content node that includes a User Input Block. This block will be used for requests to Chat GPT from your contacts.   \n_In the example below, we created a custom user field called \"free question\".\nThis field was then selected in the User Input block so that any open-ended\nquestions from users can be saved to this field._  \n  \n  \n\n  3. Add an Action block and select \u201cChatGPT Actions\u201d.  \n  \n  \n\n  4. To make a request to ChatGPT, you can provide your own prompt for the AI to respond to. You can also use advanced settings, such as Engine, Maximum tokens, and Temperature.   \n _In the prompt, we specified the name of the Custom User field in which the\nuser's question will be stored. We did not add any content to ChatGPT but\nsimply left the user's question in its original form._  \n  \n\n  5. Specify the name of the Custom Field in which the response from ChatGPT will be saved.  \n  \n  \n\n  6. Now you can create a reply message, inserting the Custom User Field that will contain the response from ChatGPT.  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThis is how our Flow looks in Manychat and Messenger.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\nPlease make sure to check the links below for information about GhatGPT\npricing and a summary of API usage for your organization:\n\n  * https://openai.com/pricing\n  * https://platform.openai.com/account/usage\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n### Related Articles\n\n  * Getting started with Zapier\n  * Google Sheets Integration\n  * MailChimp Integration\n  * Sending SMS through ManyChat\n  * ConvertKit Integration\n\nView all\n\nManychat Inc. 2023\n\n  * Terms Of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n",
