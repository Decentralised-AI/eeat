Text Optimization\n    6. Code Decryption\n    7. Text Generation\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an AI model developed by the\nOpenAI company. It is a large-scale neural network you can use to generate\ntext and code.\n\nThe primary models can perform different tasks: analyze text materials of\nvarious difficulty levels, provide answers to questions, optimize text for SEO\nand SMM tasks, categorize text in tables, help with brainstorming, edit and\ntranslate text, work with code and mathematical tasks, and support\nconversations on any or specific topics.\n\nTo set up GPT and perform your business tasks using a chatbot, you need to\nchoose a model and prompts \u2014 for example, you can add reply sentiments, limit\nyour list of questions or topics, and add additional information about your\nbusiness or an example of what you want to receive in response.\n\n### Create an Account\n\nGo to OpenAI, and create an account. Click **Sign up** , enter your email\naddress, and click **Continue** , or continue with your Google or Microsoft\naccount.\n\nIf you entered your email address, enter a password in the next window. You\nwill receive a confirmation email in your inbox. Click **Verify** in the\nemail, and enter your name and the name of your organization.\n\nEnter your phone number, and a confirmation code will be sent to it via SMS.\nEnter the code, and log into your account.\n\nBefore choosing a phone number to use, check OpenAI\u2019s list of supported\ncountries and territories.\n\n### Copy Your API Key\n\nIn the right-upper corner, click your avatar, and select \u201cManage account.\u201d\n\nGo to the \u201cAPI Keys\u201d tab, click **Create new secret Key** , and copy your key.\n\nYou need to save a key on your device because you cannot copy the same key on\nthis page a second time. If you lose the key, you will need to generate a new\none.\n\n## Set Up the Integration\n\n### Enter Your API Key\n\nChoose a bot, and go to \u201cBot settings\u201d > \u201cIntegrations.\u201d Next to \u201cOpenAI,\u201d\nclick **Enable**.\n\nSelect a connection method.\n\n**Use the token from the account settings** | If you use one OpenAI account\nfor different SendPulse services, including the chatbot builder, you can add\nyour token to general account settings.\n\nTo add a token, go to \"Account settings\" > the \"API\" tab.\n\nIn the \"Integrations > OpenAI & ChatGPT\" section, click **Connect**. Enter\nyour key, and click **Save**.\n\nOnce you add a key, you can select the \"Use the token from the account\nsettings\" option, and connect OpenAI to your chatbot.  \n  \n---|---  \n**Use a separate token for this bot** | If you need to use a dedicated OpenAI\naccount for your current chatbot, select this option, and in the next field,\nenter your key.  \n  \n### Choose a Model\n\nSelect an AI model to generate bot replies.\n\n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo)** | A model trained on human conversation data. Able\nto generate human-like responses with a more natural tone than other models\nand personalize its replies based on the topic and previous user messages.  \n---|---  \n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k)** | A model with the same capabilities as the\n`gpt-3.5-turbo` model but with 4 times the context length.  \n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-instruct)**  \n**Custom fine-tuned model** |\n\nBasic model, which you can train using your data and fine-tuning tools\nprovided by OpenAI and create your original model.\n\n_To connect a custom model to your SendPulse chatbot, specify a unique model\nname in the OpenAI library._  \n  \n**Custom fine-tuned model (Instruct)**  \n**GPT-4** |\n\nThe latest and most advanced model of the ChatGPT family, designed to\nfacilitate multi-turn conversations. The model is also useful for single-turn\ntasks without conversations.\n\n_Available only to users who received access to the model from OpenAI._  \n  \nYou can see how to use these models in \u201cExamples\u201d and \u201cOpenAI Cookbook,\u201d and\nexperiment with models in \u201cPlayground.\u201d\n\n### Add a Prompt to the Bot\n\nGPT Models can perform various tasks ranging from complex text analysis to\ngenerating replies on various topics. You need to add prompts to limit certain\ntopics you don\u2019t want your bot to discuss, tailor your bot to a specific\ncharacter or person, or add text sentiment or information about your company.\n\nWhen creating a prompt, keep the following recommendations in mind:\n\n  1. **Add as much context as possible in each case**. List all the bot interaction instructions: specify which users will contact your bot and when, which details should be included in bot replies, and which topics should be avoided.  \nGive your model the task of generating several results so that you can compare\nand specify the one that suits your needs best.\n\n  2. **Show what you want to receive using examples**. For example, if you want your model to sort a list of items alphabetically or classify paragraphs by sentiment, list your example queries, expected result format, or the effect you want to achieve. If you need the bot to reply in a certain way, provide examples of questions and answers.\n  3. **Provide high-quality and accurate data**. Check your examples \u2014 your model is usually smart enough to identify basic spelling mistakes, but it also might assume that this is intentional and mistakes can affect the reply. If you want your model to reply in a certain language, specify it. Also, try to use words instead of figures. Remember that AI takes your prompts **literally**.\n  4. **Personify the model**. To help your model reply how a certain person or character would, describe what they do, what characteristics they possess, their tone of voice, lexicon, and other aspects of your virtual assistant's persona.\n  5. **Test the result, and update your prompt**. After setting up the prompts, make sure to test the result, review chats with users and, if necessary, adjust the bot's instructions by adding or removing details. Train the model until you get the results you want.\n\nRead more: the \u201cPrompt design\u201d and \u201cPrompt Optimization\u201d sections. Note that\nOpenAI has moderation rules \u2014 read more about them in the \u201cUsage policies\u201d and\n\u201cModeration\u201d sections.\n\nYou can test models with different bot prompts on the Prompt Compare page.\n\nIf you need inspiration for context prompts, take a look at the following\nexamples: 160 ChatGPT Prompts You Can't Miss To Try Out In 2023.You can also\nuse and add your own prompts in the GitHub repository: Awesome ChatGPT\nPrompts.\n\nIn the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, provide your free-form prompts, following the\nrecommendations.\n\nNote: models have different context length limits, which refers to the amount\nof tokens you can use. Learn more in the model overview table.\n\nAI analyzes text in all languages and can answer in a language you specify,\nbut it interacts better in English. If you do not specify a language, the bot\nwill answer in English by default.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to create bot prompts or possible\nscenarios, you can check existing discussions or start a new one in the OpenAI\ncommunity.\n\n### Add a Token Number\n\nA token is a part of a word used for natural language processing. For English\ntext, 1 token equals approximately 4 characters or 0,75 words. For other\nlanguages and more accurate calculations, you can use the OpenAI calculator.\n\nIn the \u201cMaximum number of tokens in response\u201d field, specify a number from the\nlast column.\n\n**Model** | **The max number of characters in the \"Instructions for the bot\"\nfield*** | **The max number of tokens in a reply to a subscriber***  \n---|---|---  \n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo)** | up to 4096 | up to 2048  \n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k)** | up to 16348 | up to 8174  \n**ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-instruct)**  \n**Custom fine-tuned model** | up to 2048 | up to 1024  \n**Custom fine-tuned model (Instruct)**  \n**GPT-4** | up to 8192 | up to 4096  \n  \n*For each request, the tokens are counted in the following places: the \u201cBot Promt\u201d field; last messages in a chat with a bot; current question that a user asks a bot; current answer that a bot provides a user with.\n\nIf you use the max amount of tokens in the \"Bot instructions\" field, your\ntotal token data may exceed the OpenAI limit. As a result, your request will\nend with an error, and your subscriber won't receive a reply.\n\nIn such cases, you can check the error appeared as a notification in the\nupper-right corner in your SendPulse account: `OpenAI: This model's maximum\ncontext length is 4097 tokens, however you requested 4131 tokens (2083 in your\nprompt; 2048 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion\nlength`. To resolve it, lower the amount of tokens in the \"Bot instructions\"\nfield or the amount of tokens in a reply.\n\nDuring the first registration, OpenAI gives $18 dollars for 3 months. This\nmoney will be withdrawn when you use tokens.\n\nNote: Token fees vary depending on the model used. For example,\n`gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model costs twice as much as the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model,\nbecause it uses more context. Read more: What are tokens and how to count them\nand about OpenAI\u2019s pricing plans in the Pricing section.\n\nTo see how many tokens you have left, log in to your OpenAI account, and go to\nthe \u201cUsage\u201d tab.\n\nTo check your token usage history, scroll the page down to the \u201cDaily usage\nbreakdown (UTC)\u201d section. You can see the whole history or filter it by\nspecific date or team member.\n\n### Set Up the Temperature\n\nChoose a temperature indicator value from 0 to 2.\n\nTemperature is a parameter that affects the response abstractness. For\nexample, if you ask a question, the output will vary according to the selected\ntemperature: abstract or more precise. A higher temperature \u200b\u200bcloser to 2, for\nexample, 1.3, will make the answers more random. Lower temperature \u200b\u200bcloser to\n0, for example, 0.2, will make them more comprehensive while retaining the\nsame meaning.\n\nClick **Save** , and you can test your bot.\n\n## Usage Features\n\nWhen you integrate with OpenAI, your \"Standard reply\" flow will be disabled\nfor your chatbot. Therefore, you need to make sure users know that your bot\ncan reply to them. For example, add your bot communication guidelines to a\nwelcome or trigger flow that you add to your menu.\n\nWhen using OpenAI with chatbots, note that AI uses an internal information\nlibrary \u2014 it processes users\u2019 requests and gives results directly in the chat\nwith a client.\n\nAI does not have a long memory. When processing a request, only the last\ncouple of user messages are taken into account. We recommend you monitor your\nbot\u2019s conversations with customers to correct its prompts.\n\nAI does not integrate with additional applications and does not process client\ndata in your bot's audience. For these features, add a menu, or create\ncommands to run flows where you can add the \"API request,\" \"User input,\" and\n\"Action\" elements.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nLet's see various examples of how you can use a chatbot with an OpenAI\nintegration. You can see more examples on the Examples page.\n\n### Business Q&A\n\nIf you have a bot for a feature-loaded service, you can train it to\nindependently manage conversations with clients and generate answers to\nquestions about your products and working hours.\n\nFor this example, the ChatGPT model used 2048 tokens. We added short info\nabout the company, its business, and contacts. The bot can develop a dialog\nbased on the data received.\n\n**Prompt example** : You are a bot assistant to the \"Paper and pencil\"\ncompany. Our company sells stationery and office supplies. A lot of items are\nin stock, but it is better to clarify by phone: (856) 267-5442.\n\nStore address: 4472 Central Avenue, Newark.  \nWorking hours: 9:00 AM \u2013 7 PM.\n\nUse the following text to answer questions about product availability and\nprice: \"Let us check and get back to you.\"  \nUse the following text to answer questions not related to office supplies:\n\"Sorry, I have no information about it.\"\n\nFor the second example, we collected a database of frequently asked questions\nand answers to limit the scope of bot answers and provide accurate information\nabout our services.\n\nFor this example, the model used 700 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field,\nwe added basic questions and answers to them. Users don\u2019t have to ask these\nquestions verbatim, and the AI will know enough about your business to be able\nto answer naturally.\n\n**Prompt example** : ** ** The bot analyzes and provides information only from\nthe given Q&A list.\n\nQuestion: What is a bio link page?  \nAnswer: A bio link page is a one-page site that can help you promote your\nbrand on social media. Create a SendPulse account and build a bio link page\nusing the landing page builder. Read more:\nhttps://sendpulse.com/en/features/landing-page-builder\n\nQuestion: What elements can be added to my bio link page?  \nAnswer: Text, Cover, Gallery, Button, Subscription form, Payments. Read more:\nhttps://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/landing-page/builder/create-landing-\npage#adding-elements\n\n### Encyclopedia Q&A\n\nLet\u2019s say that your bot is of entertaining and informational nature. It does\nnot need to answer specific questions, but simply provide facts on, for\nexample, history or any other topic from the Internet.\n\nFor example, the model used 700 tokens. We only specified the language in\nwhich we want the bot to answer and the bot\u2019s name. If you don\u2019t choose\nspecific topics, the bot will provide answers to questions about any topic\nwithout limits.\n\n**Prompt example** : The bot's name is Marl, and it can provide answers to\nencyclopedic questions in English. The bot answers using 1 word.\n\n### Solving Life Issues\n\nIf you have a helper bot, users can describe their life situation and ask for\nadvice on what to do.\n\nFor example, the model used 700 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, we\nadded specific prompts only for vital questions. If a certain situation\nhappens, the bot will tell users who to contact.\n\n**Prompt example** : The bot helps people cope with critical situations. It\nempathizes with people and replies with care. In especially critical cases,\nsuch as death, suicide, acute poisoning, etc., please call +380501010200.\n\n### Solving Math Tasks\n\nIf you have a student helper bot, users can add their task and indicate what\nneeds to be solved.\n\nFor example, the model used 700 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, we\nadded prompts that do not allow the bot to answer non-math-related questions.\n\n**Prompt example** : The bot provides answers only to math-related questions.\nIn other cases, the bot reminds users that it only helps with math. _  \n_\n\n### Text Optimization\n\nIf you have an SMM or SEO tool, your bot can help users choose keywords or\nproofread and optimize the entered text for SEO.\n\nFor example, the model used 1024 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, we\nadded prompts that allow the bot optimize text for SEO and search for\nkeywords. If users do not run a command, the bot will remind them how to work\nwith it.\n\n**Prompt example** : This bot is an SEO expert. It knows how to find keywords\nand suggest related topics. The bot answers in English.\n\n### Code Decryption\n\nIf you teach programming, your bot can help users decode parts of code or\nerrors and tell you how a particular element or function works. Also, users\ncan ask your bot to generate code using natural language.\n\nFor example, the model used 700 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, we\nadded prompts that allow the bot to decrypt and explain code or parts of code.\nWe also added a tone so that the bot responds in a sarcastic manner using\nsimple words.\n\n**Prompt example:  The bot explains Python code in a way that even a beginner\nwill understand. It can also describe functions and create simple\napplications. If users ask about something non-code-related, the bot reminds\nthem that it only helps with coding.**\n\n### Text Generation\n\nIf you have a creative marketing agency, your bot can offer to generate text\nfor an advertising campaign or come up with a brand name, and so on.\n\nFor example, the model used 1024 tokens. In the \u201cBot instructions\u201d field, we\nadded the bot\u2019s name and wrote that it works at a marketing agency and helps\nclients create advertising slogans and create plans.\n\n**Prompt example** : ** ** The bot works for a marketing agency and helps\nclients write ad slogans and feature descriptions.\n\nLast Updated: 27.10.2023\n\n### Please specify the reason for your vote\n\nThe article lacks the necessary information to resolve my issueThe article\ncontains outdated informationThe article is too hard to understandOther\n\nWhat can we improve in this article?\n\nYour email (optional)\n\n__\n\nRequired field\n\nPlease confirm you are not a robot\n\nSubmit your feedback\n\nRate this article about \"How to Connect ChatGPT From OpenAI to Your Chatbot\"\n\n __ __ __ __ __\n\nUser Rating:   **4**  /  **5**\n\nPopular in Our Blog\n\n  * 10 Best Salesforce Alternatives in 2024\n  * 10 Best Sales Funnel Software to Try in 2024\n  * Effective Renewal Emails: Examples and Tips to Follow in 2024\n  * Recent Changes in Gmail and Yahoo Standards and What They Mean for Businesses\n  * Using Live Chat for Sales: Tips, Examples, and Things to Know\n\n### Try creating a chatbot for Facebook Messenger for free\n\nSign Up\n\nEmail\n\n    Email Campaigns\n    Transactional Emails\n    Drag-and-Drop Builder\n    Subscription Forms\n    Automation\n    Campaign Analytics\n    Free Email Templates\n    Free Chrome Extension\n\nChatbots\n\n    Chatbot Builder\n    Instagram Chatbots\n    WhatsApp Chatbots\n    WhatsApp Business API\n    WhatsApp \u0421ampaigns \n    WhatsApp Link Generator\n    Viber Chatbots\n    Facebook Chatbots\n    Telegram Chatbots\n    Chatbot Signup Widgets\n    Chatbots App\n\nServices\n\n    Online Course Builder\n    LMS\n    CRM\n    Websites\n    Bio Link Page \n    SMS\n    Viber\n    Web Push Notifications\n    Smart Pop-ups\n    NPS Widgets\n    Live Chat\n    All-in-one Platform\n\nAbout Our Company\n\n    Our Team\n    Feedback\n    Service Updates\n\nResources\n\n    SendPulse Academy\n    Help \u0421enter\n    Internet Marketing 101\n    Blog\n    Integrations\n    API\n    Expert Directory\n\nFor Partners\n\n    Partner Program\n    Affiliate Program\n    \u0421ertification\n\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Statement\n  * SendPulse Security\n  * Data Processing Agreement\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 - 2024.
