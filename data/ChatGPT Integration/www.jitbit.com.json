Integration with ChatGPT \n\nJitbit HelpDesk is a powerful ticketing system designed to streamline customer\nsupport processes. The integration with ChatGPT, an advanced AI language\nmodel, adds new capabilities to the platform, enabling users to automatically\ngenerate ticket replies and summaries, improve the readability of their own\nreplies, and customize prompts to ChatGPT. This article will guide you through\nthe process of enabling the ChatGPT integration with Jitbit HelpDesk, both for\nSaaS and on-premise versions.\n\n## Enabling ChatGPT Integration\n\n  1. Log in to your Jitbit HelpDesk account with administrator privileges.\n  2. Navigate to the \"Admin\" section in the main menu.\n  3. In the \"Admin\" section, click on \"Integrations.\"\n  4. Find the \"ChatGPT\" section and enable it by checking the box.\n\n**For SaaS Users:**\n\nAs a SaaS user, the integration is seamless, and no further action is\nrequired. Once the integration is enabled, you can start using the ChatGPT\nfeatures immediately.\n\n**For On-Premise Users:**\n\n  1. Obtain your ChatGPT API key. If you don't have one, visit OpenAI's website to sign up for an API key.\n  2. In the \"ChatGPT Integration\" section, enter your API key in the designated field.\n  3. Save the changes.\n\n## Using ChatGPT\n\nWith the integration enabled, you can now use ChatGPT to generate ticket\nreplies, summaries, and improve the readability of your own replies. Here's\nhow:\n\nNavigate to the support ticket you'd like to reply to or summarize. You will\nsee a \"GPT\" button in the ticket editor next to the \"canned responses\" button.\nAfter clicking the button, you will see four new buttons:\n\n  * Write a new reply\n  * Write a summary of all previous conversation that happened in the ticket\n  * Improve your own reply\n  * Custom prompt to ChatGPT\n\nWhen the SaaS-version of Jitbit Helpdesk generates replies **it considers your\nKnwoledge Base content** , please read more about it here. On the self-hosted\nversion ChatGPT knows nothing about your knowledge base or other tickets. All\nit has to work with is the current ticket and all the replies in it.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT with Jitbit HelpDesk brings new capabilities to the\nticket management process. By automatically generating ticket replies and\nsummaries, you can save time, reduce repetitive tasks, and provide a more\nefficient support experience to your customers.
