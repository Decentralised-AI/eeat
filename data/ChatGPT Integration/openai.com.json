Through a series of system-wide optimizations, we\u2019ve achieved\n90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December; we\u2019re now passing through those\nsavings to API users. Developers can now use our open-source Whisper large-v2\nmodel in the API with much faster and cost-effective results. ChatGPT API\nusers can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose\ndedicated capacity for deeper control over the models. We\u2019ve also listened\nclosely to feedback from our developers and refined our API terms of service\nto better meet their needs.  \n\nGet started\n\n## Early users of ChatGPT and Whisper APIs\n\n **Snap Inc**., the creator of Snapchat, introduced My AI for Snapchat+ this\nweek. The experimental feature is running on ChatGPT API. My AI offers\nSnapchatters a friendly, customizable chatbot at their fingertips that offers\nrecommendations, and can even write a haiku for friends in seconds. Snapchat,\nwhere communication and messaging is a daily behavior, has 750 million monthly\nSnapchatters:  \n\nPlay video\n\nMy AI for Snapchat+  \n\n **Quizlet** is a global learning platform with more than 60 million students\nusing it to study, practice and master whatever they\u2019re learning. Quizlet has\nworked with OpenAI for the last three years, leveraging GPT-3 across multiple\nuse cases, including vocabulary learning and practice tests. With the launch\nof ChatGPT API, Quizlet is introducing Q-Chat, a fully-adaptive AI tutor that\nengages students with adaptive questions based on relevant study materials\ndelivered through a fun chat experience:  \n\nPlay video\n\nQuizlet Q-Chat  \n\n **Instacart** is augmenting the Instacart app to enable customers to ask\nabout food and get inspirational, shoppable answers. This uses ChatGPT\nalongside Instacart\u2019s own AI and product data from their 75,000+ retail\npartner store locations to help customers discover ideas for open-ended\nshopping goals, such as \u201cHow do I make great fish tacos?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s a healthy\nlunch for my kids?\u201d Instacart plans to launch \u201cAsk Instacart\u201d later this year:  \n\nPlay video\n\nInstacart\u2019s Ask Instacart  \n\n **Shop**, Shopify\u2019s consumer app, is used by 100 million shoppers to find and\nengage with the products and brands they love. ChatGPT API is used to power\nShop\u2019s new shopping assistant. When shoppers search for products, the shopping\nassistant makes personalized recommendations based on their requests. Shop\u2019s\nnew AI-powered shopping assistant will streamline in-app shopping by scanning\nmillions of products to quickly find what buyers are looking for\u2014or help them\ndiscover something new:  \n\nPlay video\n\nShopify\u2019s Shop app  \n\n **Speak** is an AI-powered language learning app focused on building the best\npath to spoken fluency. They\u2019re the fastest-growing English app in South\nKorea, and are already using the Whisper API to power a new AI speaking\ncompanion product, and rapidly bring it to the rest of the globe. Whisper\u2019s\nhuman-level accuracy for language learners of every level unlocks true open-\nended conversational practice and highly accurate feedback:  \n\nPlay video\n\nThe Speak app  \n\n## ChatGPT API\n\n **Model** : The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today, `gpt-3.5-turbo`,\nis the same model used in the ChatGPT product. It is priced at $0.002 per 1k\ntokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models. It\u2019s also our\nbest model for many non-chat use cases\u2014we\u2019ve seen early testers migrate from\n`text-davinci-003` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` with only a small amount of adjustment\nneeded to their prompts.\n\n  \n **API** : Traditionally, GPT models consume unstructured text, which is\nrepresented to the model as a sequence of \u201ctokens.\u201d ChatGPT models instead\nconsume a sequence of messages together with metadata. (For the curious: under\nthe hood, the input is still rendered to the model as a sequence of \u201ctokens\u201d\nfor the model to consume; the raw format used by the model is a new format\ncalled Chat Markup Language (\u201cChatML\u201d).)\n\nWe\u2019ve created a new endpoint to interact with our ChatGPT models:  \n\n  * Request\n  * Response\n  * Python bindings\n\n    \n    \n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n     \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n     \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the OpenAI mission?\"}] \n     }'\n    \n    \n    {\n      \"id\": \"chatcmpl-6p5FEv1JHictSSnDZsGU4KvbuBsbu\",\n      \"object\": \"messages\",\n      \"created\": 1677693600,\n      \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      \"choices\": [\n        {\n          \"index\": 0,\n          \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n          \"message\": {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": \"OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"usage\": {\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 20,\n        \"completion_tokens\": 18,\n        \"total_tokens\": 38\n      }\n    }\n    \n    \n    import openai\n    \n    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the OpenAI mission?\"}]\n    )\n    \n    print(completion)\n\nTo learn more about the ChatGPT API, visit our Chat guide.  \n\n## ChatGPT upgrades\n\nWe are constantly improving our ChatGPT models, and want to make these\nenhancements available to developers as well. Developers who use the\n`gpt-3.5-turbo` model will always get our recommended stable model, while\nstill having the flexibility to opt for a specific model version. For example,\ntoday we\u2019re releasing `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`, which will be supported through at\nleast June 1st, and we\u2019ll update `gpt-3.5-turbo` to a new stable release in\nApril. The models page will provide switchover updates.  \n\n## Dedicated instances\n\nWe are also now offering dedicated instances for users who want deeper control\nover the specific model version and system performance. By default, requests\nare run on compute infrastructure shared with other users, who pay per\nrequest. Our API runs on Azure, and with dedicated instances, developers will\npay by time period for an allocation of compute infrastructure that\u2019s reserved\nfor serving their requests.\n\nDevelopers get full control over the instance\u2019s load (higher load improves\nthroughput but makes each request slower), the option to enable features such\nas longer context limits, and the ability to pin the model snapshot.\n\nDedicated instances can make economic sense for developers running beyond\n~450M tokens per day. Additionally, it enables directly optimizing a\ndeveloper\u2019s workload against hardware performance, which can dramatically\nreduce costs relative to shared infrastructure. For dedicated instance\ninquiries, contact us.  \n\n## Whisper API\n\nWhisper, the speech-to-text model we open-sourced in September 2022, has\nreceived immense praise from the developer community but can also be hard to\nrun. We\u2019ve now made the large-v2 model available through our API, which gives\nconvenient on-demand access priced at $0.006 / minute. In addition, our\nhighly-optimized serving stack ensures faster performance compared to other\nservices.\n\nWhisper API is available through our `transcriptions` (transcribes in source\nlanguage) or `translations` (transcribes into English) endpoints, and accepts\na variety of formats (m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, wav, webm):  \n\n  * Request\n  * Response\n  * Python bindings\n\n    \n    \n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n      -F model=\"whisper-1\" \\\n      -F file=\"@/path/to/file/openai.mp3\"\n    \n    \n    {\n      \"text\": \"Imagine the wildest idea that you've ever had, and you're curious about how it might scale to something that's a 100, a 1,000 times bigger...\"\n    }\n    \n    \n    \n    import openai\n    \n    file = open(\"/path/to/file/openai.mp3\", \"rb\")\n    transcription = openai.Audio.transcribe(\"whisper-1\", file)\n    \n    print(transcription)\n\nTo learn more about the Whisper API, visit our Speech to Text guide.  \n\n## Developer focus\n\nOver the past six months, we\u2019ve been collecting feedback from our API\ncustomers to understand how we can better serve them. We\u2019ve made concrete\nchanges, such as:  \n\n  * Data submitted through the API is no longer used for service improvements (including model training) unless the organization opts in\n  * Implementing a default 30-day data retention policy for API users, with options for stricter retention depending on user needs.\n  * Removing our pre-launch review (unlocked by improving our automated monitoring)\n  * Improving developer documentation\n  * Simplifying our Terms of Service and Usage Policies, including terms around data ownership: users own the input and output of the models.\n\nFor the past two months our uptime has not met our own expectations nor that\nof our users. Our engineering team\u2019s top priority is now stability of\nproduction use cases\u2014we know that ensuring AI benefits all of humanity\nrequires being a reliable service provider. Please hold us accountable for\nimproved uptime over the upcoming months!\n\nWe believe that AI can provide incredible opportunities and economic\nempowerment to everyone, and the best way to achieve that is to allow everyone\nto build with it. We hope that the changes we announced today will lead to\nnumerous applications that everyone can benefit from.
