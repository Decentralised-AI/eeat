Not my words,\nactually \u2014 it was Bill Gates who said that ChatGPT integration in the\nworkplace will change how we do things.\n\nYet, not everyone shares the same enthusiasm. For example, Apple co-founder\nSteve Wozniak believes that while this chatbot can do \u201cpretty impressive\nthings\u201d, it can also make \u201chorrible mistakes\u201d. So instead of just blind-\nfollowing the technology, it\u2019s always important to clearly know **why** and\n**how** you\u2019re going to use it.\n\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer, known as ChatGPT, has already changed the\nworld, but how can it revolutionize your app? (shot from the OpenAI website)\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll provide a guide for business and startup owners who are\nconsidering integrating ChatGPT into their mobile or web products. Keep on\nreading to learn more about top use cases and technical ways for\nimplementation. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n  \n\n\n## \u2696\ufe0f ChatGPT Integration: a Few Things to Keep in Mind\n\nFirst thing first, let\u2019s take a moment to align our understanding of this\nchatbot and ensure we have a clear grasp of its pros and cons.\n\nIn many articles, there\u2019s confusion about the difference between OpenAI,\nChatGPT, and GPT-3. Simply put, ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by the OpenAI\ncompany. The bot can perform various language tasks involving human language,\nsuch as answering specific questions, completing sentences, summarizing text,\ngenerating text, and more.\n\nChatGPT is a specific implementation of the GPT-3 language model, configured\nand fine-tuned to perform conversational tasks such as answering questions and\nengaging in dialogue.\n\nHowever, you may say that chatbots and AI models have already been around for\na while, so what\u2019s the hype about? Rather than holding a lecture on AI\ndevelopment history, we'll provide you with a list of pros and cons of this\nmodel to help you make an informed decision before you integrate Chat GPT into\nyour system.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * As one of the largest language models ever developed, ChatGPT can generate more nuanced and sophisticated responses than other AI chatbots.\n  * The GPT bot is available 24/7 and is designed to generate responses quickly, making it well-suited for real-time applications.\n  * ChatGPT is capable of understanding and answering questions about new topics it has never seen before.\n  * It\u2019s free and comes with detailed documentation for developers.\n  * The bot can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks or generate text in specific domains, making it highly flexible and adaptable to a wide range of applications.\n\n### Cons\n\n  * ChatGPT is a large model that requires a significant amount of computational resources.

These were just some ideas to show you that the potential\nbenefits of integrating ChatGPT are not limited to text generation.\n\nHowever, as a software development agency, we understand that every project\nrequires special treatment. If you\u2019d like to learn exactly how ChatGPT can\ncontribute to your mobile or web app, you can drop us a line!\n\nIntegrate ChatGPT into your app with our help!\n\nContact Us\n\nAnother way to learn more about its capabilities regarding your project in\nparticular is to\u2026 ask ChatGPT! However, the quality of the answer heavily\ndepends on the question itself. Thus, it\u2019s necessary to write an accurate\nprompt that would put the bot in the relevant context.\n\nBut don\u2019t bother doing it from scratch, as we did it for you! Below you can\nfind a prompt example that will help the bot provide you with a detailed and\ninsightful answer. You just need to fill in the blank spaces and send it out!\n\nHi, I own a ________ [ _type of business/app_ ] in the ________ [ _industry_ ]\nindustry. We're looking to explore how ChatGPT can help us improve our\nworkflows and better engage with our stakeholders. Specifically, we're\ninterested in addressing ________ [ _specific challenges or pain points_ ] and\nachieving ________ [ _specific goals or objectives_ ].\n\nCan you recommend some use cases and applications of ChatGPT that could be\nuseful for our business?\n\nIt seems we\u2019ve covered _why\u2019s_ of integrating ChatGPT. However, one of the key\nquestions is still on the table: _how_ do you make all this magic happen?\n\nIn the next section, we won\u2019t go deep into technical details as this is not\nhow-to instruction for developers. Instead, we\u2019d rather want to explain to the\nowners of mobile and web apps the key differences in approaches to ChatGPT\nintegration.\n\n  \n\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Technical Ways to Integrate ChatGPT\n\nThe key thing you should know as a non-developer: **you need professional\ndevelopers to integrate ChatGPT into your mobile or web app**. This may be\neverything you need to know if you decide to delegate this task to your\ncurrent or future Tech Partner.\n\nHowever, if you want to have a better picture of GPT Chat integration for\nyourself, we\u2019ll cover that in this section!\n\nThere are different ways to integrate GPT-3 technology into your app.\nIntegrating ChatGPT's advanced neural network into your platform can\nsignificantly enhance user interaction and data processing capabilities.\n(image by soroush norozy)\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there are several approaches to ChatGPT\nintegration, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we\ndecided to focus on 3 approaches:\n\n  * API integration\n  * using a chatbot builder platform\n  * custom implementation.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each option!\n\n  \n\n\n### Option # 1: API\n\n_Difficulty of implementation:_ \u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f/3\n\n_Customization possibilities:_ \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1/3\n\nOne of the easiest ways to integrate ChatGPT into your mobile or web app is by\nusing an API.\n\nAn API is a pre-built solution that you can integrate into your project\nwithout having to develop anything from scratch. You can think of it as a set\nof instructions on how your app should communicate with different third-party\napplications or tools \u2014 ChatGPT, in our case.\n\nDue to its simplicity, this method requires minimal technical expertise and\nresources. Thus, it can be a great option for businesses that want to quickly\nintegrate a chatbot into their app without investing too much time or\nresources.\n\nOn the other hand, it provides fewer customization options compared to other\nmethods. Therefore, you won\u2019t be able to fine-tune ChatGPT to your needs but\nrather create an interface within your app so users can directly ask the bot.\n\n  \n\n\n### Option # 2: Chatbot Builder Platform\n\n_Difficulty of implementation:_ \u2699\ufe0f/3\n\n_Customization possibilities:_ \ud83d\udcf1/3\n\nUsing a chatbot builder platform is an easy and accessible way to integrate\nChatGPT into your mobile or web app. Such platforms usually come with a\nvariety of pre-built tools and interfaces for creating chatbots, including\nintegrations with ChatGPT.\n\nAnother thing that may be important to you is that chatbot builders often have\nsubscription-based pricing models with different tiers. This means that you,\nas a business owner, can choose a pricing plan that suits your budget and\nusage needs, and gradually scale as your needs grow.\n\nSome chatbot builders require minimal technical knowledge but provide limited\nfunctionality (image by Arvin Aradhana)\n\nWhen using chatbot builders, it\u2019s important to remember that the level of\npossible customization is defined by the platform itself. Thus, in some cases,\nyou may go pretty far with setting your own design and functionality of the\nbot. At the same time, other platforms may have serious limitations on the\ntypes of responses that can be generated or the types of integrations that can\nbe made.\n\nTherefore, this solution may work best for business owners who want to\nintegrate ChatGPT into their mobile or web app while having limited financial\nand time resources. Yet, the flip side of the coin is that they\u2019ll have to\ndeal with limited functionality.\n\nSome of the chatbot builders that support ChatGPT integrations are:\n\n  * Chatfuel\n  * Landbot\n  * Tars.\n\n  \n\n\n### Option # 3: Custom Implementation\n\n_Difficulty of implementation:_ \u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f/3\n\n_Customization possibilities:_ \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1/3\n\nThis option is rather a mix of the previous two with its own specifics. Simply\nput, it requires creating your own chatbot from scratch and then implementing\nAPI integration.\n\nCustom implementation is typically the most complex and requires the most\ntechnical expertise and resources. That\u2019s because businesses must create a\nunique code base to interface with the ChatGPT API and develop their own logic\nto handle the user\u2019s inputs and generate appropriate responses.\n\nIntegrating Chat GPT into your business is the only way to fine-tune the bot\naccurately to meet your specific needs. (image by Maciej Dyjak)\n\nAt the same time, custom ChatGPT integration provides the highest level of\nflexibility. Thus, businesses can design the chatbot\u2019s responses and workflows\nto fit their specific needs.\n\nThe process of creating a custom implementation for ChatGPT integration\ninvolves:\n\n  * defining the chatbot\u2019s functionality\n  * designing the conversation flow\n  * creating the front-end interface\n  * and building the back-end logic to interface with the ChatGPT API.\n\nDepending on the scope of the project, this process can take anywhere from a\nfew weeks to several months to complete. Furthermore, ongoing maintenance and\nupdates may also be required as the chatbot is used and new use cases emerge.\n\nRead also:\n\nHow to Make a Chatbot Using JS\n\nCustom GPT Chat integration will suit businesses that require a high level of\ncustomization and control over their chatbot. For instance, businesses in\nregulated industries like finance and healthcare may need to adhere to strict\ncompliance guidelines that require a custom implementation to ensure\ncompliance. Additionally, businesses with unique user journeys and use cases\nmay benefit from a custom implementation to create a chatbot that aligns with\ntheir brand and user experience.\n\nIntegrating ChatGPT into your mobile or web app can be achieved through three\nmain methods: **API integration, using a chatbot builder platform, or custom\nimplementation.** Each option offers different levels of difficulty,\ncustomization, and resource investment.\n\n  * API integration is the simplest and requires minimal technical expertise, making it ideal for quick integration with limited customization.\n\n  * Chatbot builder platforms offer a balance of ease and some customization, suitable for businesses with limited resources.\n\n  * Custom implementation, while the most complex and resource-intensive, provides the highest level of customization, ideal for businesses with specific needs, such as those in regulated industries or with unique user journeys.\n\n_Choosing the right integration method depends on your business's technical\ncapabilities, resource availability, and specific needs._\n\n  \n\n\n### Chat GPT Integration Examples \ud83d\udcf1\n\nIf it seems a little bit risky to implement such new technology into your\nworkflows, don\u2019t worry. There are already some successful examples of ChatGPT\nhelping businesses address their needs:\n\n  * Duolingo uses GPT-3 to provide French grammar corrections.\n  * Viable leverages ChatGPT capabilities to analyze customer feedback and provide its summary, urgency score, tone of voice, and other insights.\n  * Keeper Tax automatically find tax-deductible expenses by looking through their bank statements.\n\nKeeper Tax is on the growing list of companies that already integrated GPT-3\ntechnology into their apps (shot from the Keeper Tax website)\n\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, also offers a tutorial on how to integrate\nthe bot for various use cases. For example, on this page, they explain how to\nreplace a standard FAQ block in the app with an \"open question\" block, so the\nbot can write a custom answer to a user based on your knowledge base.\n\nFinally, you can check this page for even more examples!\n\n  \n\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Takeaways\n\nBy considering the different ways to integrate with ChatGPT in their mobile or\nweb app, businesses can select the approach that aligns best with their needs\nand resources. Whether a business is looking for a quick and easy solution or\na customized chatbot with advanced capabilities, there is a method available\nto help take their app to the next level.\n\nWhen it comes down to specific options, there are 3 major approaches to choose\nfrom:\n\n  * API integration \u2014 just a direct \u201cwindow\u201d within your app so users can ask ChatGPT something.\n  * Using a chatbot builder platform \u2014 a quick and simple way to build a chatbot with GPT-3 integration but limited functionality.\n  * Custom implementation \u2014 custom development will require the most resources yet will open up the broadest customization possibilities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Tech Partner to enhance your app with ChatGPT\ncapabilities, drop us a line and we\u2019ll see where our expertise and your needs\ncross \ud83d\ude42\n\nNeed Help?
