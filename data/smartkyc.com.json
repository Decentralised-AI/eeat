Through the automation of deep KYC background checks on\ncompanies and people, smartKYC uses AI to do the research \u201cheavy lifting\u201d that\na human would normally do. To learn more \u0003watch our explainer video.\n\n## Financial institutions and, increasingly, corporates are overwhelmed by the\nscale and complexity of their KYC / KY3P workloads. They are trying to cope\nwith:\n\nA myriad of sources and extensive checklists of information to gather and\nverify\n\nLarge, diffuse client bases, often international in character\n\nEver-evolving regulatory requirements coupled with internal pressure to\ndeliver\n\nThis is set against a backdrop of the systemic risk of human error along with\nan aspiration to go further and automatically run batch processes like\nremediation work or continuous risk monitoring programmes.\n\n **smartKYC solves all these problems, today.**\n\nBy combining artificial intelligence, linguistic and cultural sensitivity and\ndeep domain knowledge, smartKYC sets new standards for KYC quality, transforms\nproductivity and hardwires compliance conformance.\n\n## Why smartKYC\n\nThe smartKYC enterprise-grade platform is designed to make the whole spectrum\nof KYC due diligence, from IDV to EDD, faster, better and more cost effective.\nHow?\n\n## Faster\n\nThrough intelligent, explainable AI, the research heavy-lifting is done at\nspeed and at scale by machine, often enabling straight through processing\n\n## Better\n\nBy reducing the risk of human error, especially in the handling of foreign\nlanguage material. Every line of every source, regardless of structure or\nmeans of access, is analysed\n\n## More cost effective\n\nResources can be moved away from labour-intensive, \u2018mechanical\u2019 processes like\nsearching and reading documents, many of them highly repetitive or ambiguous,\nto tackle more productive tasks\n\n## Solutions\n\n **smartKYC applies AI to extract precise open source intelligence (OSINT)\nfrom vast corpuses of information \u2013 internet and deep web, news archives,\nwatchlists and corporate databases.**\n\nMultiple identifying attributes are used to ensure the right identity is being\nprofiled, even in media sources. And all sources are robotically analysed,\nwith semantic precision, in the native language so that every linguistic\nnuance is captured \u2013 not machine-translated into English first and then\nprocessed.\n\n**Find out more**\n\n## Technology\n\nsmartKYC combines extensive industry intelligence with a range of\nsophisticated, proprietary technologies including\n\n### Federated search\n\nPublic (e.g. web), professional (e.g. subscription) and private (e.g.\nblacklist) sources can be integrated and harmonised. We have over 50 available\nout-of-the-box\n\n### Sophisticated name handling\n\nA tailored approach to variant generation, name matching, origin detection,\nidentity matching, hit aggregation and more\n\n### Natural, multi-language processing (NMLP)\n\nScoring media hits for relevance based on multiple identifying attributes and\nextracting rich intelligence from these sources, regardless of language or\nscript\n\n## Sounds complex, but it is actually quite simple. smartKYC also:\n\n  * Can be configured to reflect client risk policy\n  * Can be integrated into proprietary systems or 3rd party tools because of its API-first design\n  * Supports a multi-tenant architecture\n  * Can satisfy all security requirements\n  * Can be hosted on premise or in the cloud\n  * Is highly scalable\n\n**Find out more**\n\n## Markets\n\nsmartKYC serves the financial services and consultancy communities with a\nmajor focus on:\n\n  * Private Banking & Wealth Management\n  * Corporate & Investment Banking\n  * Retail Banking\n  * Compliance Advisory & Support Services\n  * Multinationals\n\n**Get in touch**\n\nIf you share some (if not all) of the characteristics below, get in touch:\n\n **High KYC case loads and a desire to straight through process as much as\npossible**\n\n **Sensitivity to the potential reputational impact of an enforcement action**\n\n **Added case complexity, often due to geographic footprint (linguistic and\nlocation) or client type risk**\n\n **A desire to systemise a very manual process and greatly reduce, if not\neradicate, multiple points of failure**\n\n## Awards and Recognitions\n\n__Tweet\n\n __Share\n\n __Share\n\n0 Shares\n\nCompany Number: 08892868  \nRegistered Address: International House,  \n36-38 Cornhill, London, EC3V 3NG,  \nUnited Kingdom\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n\u00a92023 , smartKYC\n\n##\n\n **contact@smartkyc.com**\n\n__\n\n"
