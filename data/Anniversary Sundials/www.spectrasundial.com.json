You're looking at one\nright now!\n\n\n\nThe Spectra sundial is a custom-made indoor rainbow sundial that can be\nenjoyed year round in any sunny spot. Unique among sundials, the Spectra\nsundial earns its name by producing vivid prism beams, flooding the room with\nintense rainbow color as it uses the sun to accurately tell the time of day.\nAs the sun moves across the sky, the Spectra sundial creates a slow motion\nparade of bright rainbow colors moving through the room, sometimes three large\nbrilliant spectrum beams at a time.\n\n\n\nThe Spectra sundial is one of the most unique anniversary gifts available\nanywhere, especially when personalized with a special inscription and date\nline to celebrate the special day for years to come - then the tip of the time\nshadow of the sundial will \"ride the line\" on the anniversary day each year.\nYou can even have a Spectra sundial made with custom date lines celebrating\nfamily birthdays to create a future family heirloom, and it can be really fun\nfor family members to watch the time shadow getting closer and closer each day\nto touching their special birthday date line each year!\n\n\n\nSince it is \"traditional\" to give something made of paper for a first\nanniversary gift, and the \"modern\" gift recommendation is to give a clock, you\ncan do both by giving a gift certificate for a Spectra sundial...then you can\nwork together to decide where in the home it should go and what you would like\nit to say.
