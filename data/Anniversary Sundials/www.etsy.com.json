It matches my address plaque perfectly. I\nwould\u2019ve given 5 stars if it hadn\u2019t taken so long for me to actually be able\nto put it up. Delivery was quick, but they actually sent me the wrong sign.\nThe second time, they sent me the correct sign but the hardware completely\nbroke. One would think the screw would strip before snapping, but the material\nis so soft that the head came clean off with very little effort. I reached out\nto the company and asked for replacement screws. They apologized and said they\nwould send out replacements. However, I then received a sundial gnomon instead\nof the screws. I reached out again and they sent out the correct replacement.\nThat being said, communication was great and each delivery was speedy.
