Here are a few examples.\n\n  * The Britain-Australia Society Education Trust commissioned David Harber and Nigel Fenwick to build an armillary sphere sundial on a carved base to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of unsung hero Admiral Arthur Phillip. Phillip was the commander of the historic British First Fleet to Australia in 1787 and the first Governor of modern Australia.\n  * Personalized details include an internal globe showing the path of the historic 11 ship convoy to Australia under Phillip's command, while the base plate and bands mark Phillip's achievements.\n\nScroll for more\n\nA sundial engraved with the words _About Time_ celebrates the 30th anniversary\nof women undergraduates arriving at Balliol, one of Oxford University's oldest\ncolleges.\n\nThe engraving was the winning caption in a competition among women students\nfor an inscription which captured the spirit of the anniversary sundial. It is\nengraved on the base and reflected in the mirror polished stainless steel\nglobe.\n\nThe base also bears the words: _For all women at Balliol: past present and\nfuture_ \u2013 to denote that all woman of Balliol are referenced, not only\nstudents and academics.\n\nA line on the dial marks the day that the first woman undergraduate entered\nBalliol and lights up each year on that date \u2013 11th October \u2013 thanks to a\nspecial notch on the time telling gnomon.\n\nBalliol College was the first of the all-male colleges to elect a woman as a\nFellow and Tutor in 1973, with students following six years later.\n\n    * Personalized memorial on a stainless steel obelisk\n    * Cyclist _Pinky_ Williams is the subject of a memorial sundial commissioned by the North Lanarkshire Regeneration Council in Scotland. The stainless steel armillary sphere commemorating Pinky's life is movingly personalized with dates and details of his cycling achievements. \n\n### DOWNLOAD BROCHURE\n\n* I understand the information I have provided is subject to the privacy policy   \n\nKeep me informed of David Harber news and events  \n\nWe do not share or sell on your personal information.\n\nWe respect your privacy\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nSkip navigation\n\n  * Home\n  * Sundials\n  * Sculptures\n  * Water Features\n  * About\n  * Contact Us\n  * Trade Site\n\n  * Australia\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Deutsch\n  * UK\n\n#### Tel: 312.895.1586\n\n####  E: sales@davidharber.com\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n  * Australia\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Deutsch\n  * UK\n\n  * Terms\n  * Privacy\n  * How to find us in the UK\n  * \u00a9 David Harber 2024 All rights reserved\n\n## This website uses cookies\n\nTo learn more see our privacy policy.
