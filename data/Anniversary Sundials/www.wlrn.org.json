\u2022 49:58\n\nWALTER MICHOT\n\n/\n\nMIAMI HERALD\n\nDon Smiley hoists the Championship trophy in the Marlins locker room after the\nMarlins defeated the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series. To\nhis right with a cigar in his mouth is club owner H. Wayne Huizenga.\n\nSundial celebrated their one-year anniversary on Tuesday, Oct. 2. The\nproducers of the show invited the first ever Sundial guest, WLRN\u2019s Americas\nCorrespondent Tim Padgett, for the one-year special.\n\nThe U.S. government continues to increase its detention and deportation\nprograms for undocumented immigrants. This has not stopped Central Americans\n-- especially Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans -- from continuing to\nflee their home countries and asking for asylum in the U.S. A new study\ncalled, \u201cLeaving the Devil You Know\u201d by Vanderbilt University in Tennessee\nfinds the main reason Central Americans are fleeing their countries is to\nescape the violence of gang wars. WLRN\u2019s Tim Padgett talked to the lead author\nof the study and joined Sundial to talk about what the author said about the\nstudy\u2019s findings.\n\nVoters in the City of Miami will have the opportunity to vote for a \u201cstrong\nmayor\u201d initiative on the November general election. The \u201cstrong mayor\u201d\nproposal would give extended power to the City of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.\nThere are a number of city commissioners in fierce opposition of the proposal,\nincluding Joe Carollo, who has filed a lawsuit arguing that the language in\nthe measure is unclear as it relates to a strong mayor\u2019s level of\ncompensation. Former Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas is part of\nAccountable Miami, one of the groups advocating for the \u201cstrong mayor\u201d ballot\nmeasure. Penelas joined Sundial to explain what the strong mayor proposal is\nand why it would be a good fit for the city.\n\n\u201cThe Chicken Runs at Midnight\u201d has become an iconic phrase for Marlins fans\nover the past two decades. The expression has a fascinating history, dating\nback to 1997 when the Marlins won their first World Series against the\nCleveland Indians. A new book by sportswriter Tom Friend called, \u201cThe Chicken\nRuns at Midnight\u201d details the story and ran as an ESPN special earlier this\nmonth. The Marlins\u2019 former third base coach Rich Donnelly was the one who\ncoined the phrase in 1997. Donnelly and Friend joined Sundial to talk about\nthe book and how Donnelly\u2019s daughter played a huge part in making the\nexpression so iconic.\n\nSundial\n\nStay Connected\n\n  * twitter\n  * facebook\n\nStay Connected\n\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * youtube\n  * facebook\n  * linkedin\n\n\u00a9 2024 WLRN\n\n  * About\n\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * Donate\n\n  * Underwrite\n\n  * Shop\n\n  * WLRN-TV FCC Public File\n\n  * WLRN-FM FCC Public File\n\n  * WKWM-FM FCC Public File\n\n  * WLRN Public Files and Records\n\n  * EEO Report\n\n  * Station Public Files Contact - \n\n    * Adrienne Kennedy akennedy@wlrn.org (305)-995-2256\n\n  * FRIENDS OF WLRN, INC.
