Since then I have posted a new article once a week, accumulating a\nwhopping total of more than 500 posts--some about far away places, others much\ncloser to home. Most are about my own travel experiences, but others are about\nthe trips made by family and friends. I thank all my guest posters who have\ncontributed reports of their adventures on _The Intrepid Tourist_ and shared\ntheir personal views of the world.  \n  \n---  \nBerkeley Botanical Garden, Berkeley, CA  \nIn many of my travels, I have come across sundials and been fascinated by both\ntheir beauty and technology. In celebration of the beginning of a new year of\n_The Intrepid Tourist_ I an sharing a few of my sundial photos.  \n  \n---  \nSundial Bridge, Redding, CA  \nRanging in size from the giant sundial bridge at Turtle Bay in Redding,\nCalifornia, to a small garden decoration sundial at the Clark Library in Los\nAngeles, each one has its own special character.  \n  \n---  \nSundial by Eric Gill, UCLA Clark Library garden, Los Angeles, CA  \nThe oldest known sundial was found in Egypt found in the Valley of the Kings\n(c. 1500 BC). I have never been to Egypt, but in Rajasthan, India, there is a\ncollection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the\nRajput king Sawai Jai Singh II, and completed in 1734. It features the world's\nlargest stone sundial _._ I visited this amazing UNESCO world Heritage site\nwhen I was in India in 2000.  \n  \n---  \nStone sun dial at Jantar Mantar, Rajasthan, India  \nThe marker, _or gnomen,_ at the center of the sundial casts its shadow as the\nsun moves across the sky and indicates the time of day. Importantly, its angle\nmust be equivalent to the Earth's latitude at that point.  \n  \n---  \nSundial at the Santa Barbara Zoo, California at 4:00 p.m.  \nA simple way of telling time by the sun is with your own shadow. At the Santa\nBarbara Zoo, in Santa Barbara, California, is a sundial that is read by\nstanding in the center and casting your own shadow.  \n  \n---  \nAlpha and Omega Sundial in memory of Harriet M. Gale, Grinnell College,\nGrinnell, Iowa. Paul T. Granlund, Sculptor  \nAt Grinnell College a sundial in the center of campus honors the wife of a\nretired physics professor. At the University of North Carolina, the Morehead\nSundial is on a plaza near the center of campus and has an accompanying plaque\nthat tells us exactly where we are on Earth. I love sundials. They are\nbeautiful and functional and as long as the sun is shining, will always tell\nthe time.  \nHappy 8th Anniversary to _The Intrepid Tourist_!  \n  \n---  \nMorehead Sundial Plaque, UNC Campus, Chapel Hill, North Carolina  \n  \n_  \n_\n\nPosted by  five nests at  8:00 AM\n\nLabels: anniversary, Berkeley, blog, bridge, California, Grinnell College,\nIndia, Rajasthan, Redlands, sundial, University of North Carolina\n\n#### No comments:\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\nNote: Only a member of this blog may post a comment.\n\nNewer Post Older Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\n\n## 2024: Traveling Again\n\nAs I travel, I want to know: What do people like me do? Where do they eat?\nWhat do they like best? What are some of their favorite places, both on and\noff the beaten track? Like most of you, my travel was severely curtailed\nduring Covid 19. As we begin to venture out again, I have gone back to posting\narticles about current travel, to both local and more distant destinations.\nMany thanks to my guest posters for expanding the breadth and scope of this\nblog. As always, you can use the search function to look for posts about a\nparticular country, state or other categories.  \n\nHappy traveling, both real and virtual, in 2024!\n\n## MEMOIR: A Unique Childhood\n\n**SETTLEMENT HOUSE GIRL** , my memoir of my growing up years in Minneapolis,\nMinnesota, is now available at Amazon or to order at your independent book\nstore.

(Translation: I like vacation spots that are off the beaten track but I\u2019m willing to get there in a rented car and stay in a comfortable hotel.) I like trips to remote or unusual places especially if they feature wildlife, ancient history, cultural events, opportunities for hiking or other outdoor activities. Sometimes I am an accidental tourist, a result of my own or my husband\u2019s business travel. I am a children\u2019s book author and travel for research and to speak at schools and conferences. (Go to www.carolinearnold.com or www.carolinearnoldart.blogspot.com for more about my books and art.) My husband is a scientist and international meetings have provided the starting point for trips. Sometimes my destination is chosen because of family connections. And sometimes I simply choose a place because I have never been there before. I have always kept a diary when I travel (long before blogs were invented) and written the occasional article about my trips. Some of those articles and diary entries (heretofore unpublished) will be posted here. I will also post comments on my current and recent travel.\nView my complete profile\n\n## Art Cards and Prints, Perfect for Any Time\n\nSee my animal prints of my cut-paper art at\nwww.etsy.com/shop/CarolineArnoldArt.
