## Industry Features and Prices

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatibility

One of the fundamental features for deploying an EVM blockchain is ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This compatibility allows for seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts. Several platforms and services offer EVM compatibility, including:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: The Ethereum Mainnet is the primary network for deploying EVM blockchains. The associated costs for deploying and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum Mainnet vary based on network congestion and gas fees.

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: BSC provides EVM compatibility and offers lower transaction fees compared to the Ethereum Mainnet. The cost of deploying EVM blockchains on BSC is relatively lower, making it an attractive option for organizations seeking cost-effective solutions.

- **Polygon (formerly Matic Network)**: Polygon is a layer 2 scaling solution that is EVM-compatible. It offers faster and cheaper transactions, making it a cost-effective option for deploying EVM blockchains.

### Smart Contract Deployment

The ability to deploy smart contracts is a critical feature for EVM blockchain deployment. Platforms and services offer varying prices for smart contract deployment, often based on the complexity and execution requirements of the smart contracts. Some prominent platforms for smart contract deployment and their associated costs include:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum Mainnet incurs gas fees, which fluctuate based on network activity. The cost of smart contract deployment can range from a few dollars to significant amounts for complex contracts.

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: BSC offers cost advantages for smart contract deployment, with significantly lower gas fees compared to the Ethereum Mainnet. Organizations can deploy smart contracts on BSC at a fraction of the cost associated with the Ethereum Mainnet.

- **Polygon (formerly Matic Network)**: Smart contract deployment on Polygon is cost-efficient, leveraging its layer 2 scaling capabilities to reduce transaction costs. The pricing for smart contract deployment on Polygon is competitive, making it an attractive option for organizations mindful of deployment expenses.

### Scalability and Throughput

Scalability and throughput are crucial considerations for EVM blockchain deployment, especially for applications with high transaction volumes. Platforms and services offer varying levels of scalability and throughput, with associated pricing models based on usage and resource allocation. Key platforms for scalable EVM blockchain deployment and their price considerations include:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: While the Ethereum Mainnet provides robust security and decentralization, its scalability and throughput limitations can result in higher gas fees during periods of network congestion. Organizations deploying EVM blockchains on the Ethereum Mainnet should account for potential scalability challenges and associated costs.

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: BSC offers enhanced scalability and higher throughput compared to the Ethereum Mainnet, resulting in lower transaction costs and faster confirmation times. The pricing for utilizing BSC's scalability features is competitive, making it an appealing option for applications requiring high transaction throughput.

- **Polygon (formerly Matic Network)**: Polygon's layer 2 scaling capabilities provide exceptional scalability and throughput for EVM blockchains. The pricing for leveraging Polygon's scalability features is designed to be cost-effective, offering organizations the ability to accommodate growing transaction volumes without incurring significant expenses.

### Decentralization and Security

Decentralization and security are paramount for EVM blockchain deployment, ensuring the integrity and resilience of the network. Platforms and services differ in their approaches to decentralization and security, with associated costs reflecting the measures implemented. Notable considerations for decentralization and security in EVM blockchain deployment include:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: The Ethereum Mainnet is renowned for its high level of decentralization and security, underpinned by a large and geographically distributed network of nodes. However, the costs associated with maintaining decentralization and security on the Ethereum Mainnet can be significant, particularly for applications requiring robust protection against potential attacks.

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: BSC balances decentralization and security with cost-efficiency, offering a more centralized consensus mechanism compared to the Ethereum Mainnet. The associated costs for maintaining decentralization and security on BSC are relatively lower, making it an attractive option for organizations seeking a pragmatic approach to network protection.

- **Polygon (formerly Matic Network)**: Polygon's architecture provides a secure and decentralized environment for EVM blockchains, leveraging Ethereum's security while offering enhanced scalability. The costs associated with decentralization and security on Polygon are designed to be competitive, ensuring that organizations can prioritize network integrity without incurring excessive expenses.
