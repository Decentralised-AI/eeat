All of the chains we support are shown in our **Chainlist**:\n\nRPCs, Faucets, & Explorers for 700+ Chains | thirdweb Chainlist\n\nIn our **_Chainlist_**, you can look up any EVM-compatible blockchain \u2014\nincluding mainnets and testnets \u2014 and discover resources to like RPCs, block\nexplorers, faucets, and more for each:\n\nDon't see your protocol listed? Let us know.\n\nWithin the thirdweb **Dashboard**, you can also easily search for & add any\nnetwork to Your Networks, including _custom_ EVM chains! All you need is your\nchain ID and a RPC URL:\n\nSearch & add any EVM network to your thirdweb Dashboard\n\nthirdweb Dashboard\n\n## Build with thirdweb\u2019s tools: permissionless, composable, and owned by you\n\nThe future is multi-chain, and we're excited to open up our web3 toolkit to\ndeveloper ecosystems spanning 700+ blockchains.\n\n **Get started with thirdweb by deploying any contract, import an existing\none, and building on any EVM-compatible blockchain! Simply head over to our\n**dashboard** and search for your contract address. **\ud83d\udd0d\n\nIf you've got any questions, drop us a line in our **Discord** community!

Rollups\nreduce gas fees and improve throughput by executing transactions outside\nEthereum while inheriting its security. This design space allows developers to\ncreate scalable applications with low-entry barriers.  While rollups handle\nscaling, there is also the need to customize.

A 5-Minute Explainer\n\nEthereum, for long, has been stumbling upon one fundamental roadblock: the\nblockchain trilemma. The tradeoff between security, decentralization, and\nscalability forces developers to consider two at the cost of the third. But,\nwhen it comes to resolving scalability issues, an often overlooked issue is\ndata availability.
