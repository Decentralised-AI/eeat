Its most\nimmediate application will be the integration of our mainnet with Chainlink\u2019s\nprice feed, which is planned for completion in the coming weeks. This\nintegration will allow us to price the network services in USD, and enable us\nto add other fiat currencies as needed in the future, making it simpler for\norganizations to issue verifiable credentials on Dock\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nTo illustrate the steps for deploying and using EVM smart contracts on the\nDock mainnet, our team has created a tutorial for deploying a decentralized\nautonomous organization (DAO). The tutorial contains step-by-step instructions\nfor handling EVM accounts and setting up and executing an example DAO on Dock.\n\nWe will continue to add new features to our offerings and contribute to the\nPolkadot ecosystem. The team\u2019s plan for the rest of 2021 is reflected in our\nroadmap, which was explained in detail in an earlier blog post.\n\n **About Dock**\n\nDock is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and\ndevelopers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly\nverifiable using blockchain technology. Dock has leveraged Polkadot to create\na standalone blockchain, integrated payment and incentivisation token, a\ntrusted network of validators, and seamless adoption and interoperability.\nDock is part of a movement to solve universal problems with existing data and\nhow it is captured, shared and controlled.
