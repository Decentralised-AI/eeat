Here\u2019s a\nrundown of how I did it.\n\n _> >>_ ** _This guide will NOT explain how to write a smart contract_** _,\nonly how to deploy one. <<<_\n\n _For this current stage of my project, I am just testing a sample contract\nand I will assume that you already have a contract prepared that you wish to\ndeploy._\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is built upon the Solidity language. Many\nother chains have adopted the same language to create their own ecosystems,\nwhich conveniently allows smart contracts that are coded in Solidity to be\ncompatible between these chains.\n\nWell-known EVM-based/compatible chains include:\n\n  * Ethereum (obviously)\n  * Tron\n  * Binance Smart Chain\n  * Avalanche\n\nFor a more comprehensive list **see here**.\n\nI will be using **Fantom** for my test, but you can use whichever you like.\n\n## 1.\n\nFirst, you need to have the Metamask wallet installed on your browser (or some\nother wallet that allows testnets) and add the testnet and mainnet networks\nthat you want to use.\n\nMetamask\n\nTo add Fantom Testnet:\n\nNetwork Name: Fantom Testnet  \nNew RPC URL: https://rpc.testnet.fantom.network/  \nChain ID: 4002  \nCurrency Symbol: FTM  \nBlock Explorer URL: https://explorer.testnet.fantom.network/\n\nGo to the faucet of your testnet of choice and request tokens to your wallet\u2019s\naddress. Fantom faucet.\n\n _When it comes to deploying on mainnet, you will have to buy real tokens._\n\n## 2.\n\nGo to **Remix** \u2014 this site allows you to compile and deploy EVM smart\ncontracts. Create a new file or load one from elsewhere. To make a new file,\nselect the button and give it a name, then you can begin editing it.\n\nI loaded mine from Github.\n\nOnce the code is in the editor hit CTRL+S or the green arrow at the top to\ncompile it and you will get a message from the Solidity symbol on the lefthand\npane if the code is approved (note - this does not mean there are no bugs in\nit!).\n\nAfter the smart contract is compiled, you can deploy it.\n\n## 3.\n\nClick on the _Deploy_ button on the lefthand pane (Ethereum symbol) to go to\nthe _Deploy_ page.\n\nFor _Environment_ , select \u201cInjected Provider \u2014 Metamask\u201d. This will connect\nyour Metamask wallet to Remix and assign the network that MM is connected to\n(which should be the testnet you\u2019re planning to use) as the network that the\nsmart contract will deploy to.\n\nYou will know if the wallet is correctly connected because \u201cAccount\u201d should\nshow your wallet\u2019s address and the balance of the network you\u2019re connected to.\nIf the balance isn\u2019t right, try to reconnect your wallet, because you don\u2019t\nwant to deploy to the wrong network and accidentally pay real funds for gas.\n\nHit the orange \u201cDeploy\u201d button to initialise the smart contract deployment.\nYou will be prompted by your wallet to pay the gas fee for deployment. Confirm\nit.\n\n## 4.\n\nWith the smart contract deployed, you will be able to see the contract\u2019s\naddress and buttons that will allow you to use its functions. There will also\nbe a readout in the console in bottom-right.\n\nYou can use the contract address to search for the contract in its network\u2019s\nexplorer. You can also send funds to that address if need be, but make sure\nyou are willing to lose any funds sent, or have a way to return them before\nsending any significant amounts.\n\n **Fantom Testnet Explorer:**\n\nMy test smart contract with funds added\n\n _At this point, I decided to deploy the smart contract on Polygon\u2019s Mumbai\ntestnet instead. This showed how compatible the EVM chains are because I\ndidn\u2019t need to edit any of the contract to deploy it. I just refreshed Remix,\nrecompiled the contract and changed which network my Metamask wallet was\nconnected to when I redeployed it. It even had the same contract address._\n\nRedployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet\n\nYou can test your contract on the testnet to make sure that all the functions\nwork as intended by using the buttons on the lefthand side. You will be\nprompted to pay the gas fee for each function you interact with.\n\nTesting functions\n\n## Part 1 Conclusion\n\nWith my smart contract successfully deployed on Polygon\u2019s testnet, I will end\nthis part of the guide so I have time to play around with it. I\u2019ll continue\nthe guide when it becomes time to deploy on mainnet.\n\nThanks for reading, see you again soon.\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the\nworld.\n\n## Free\n\nDistraction-free reading.
