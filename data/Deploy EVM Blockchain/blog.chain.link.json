Fantom is EVM compatible, so dApps and\nexisting developer infrastructure can easily be ported and used on this\nincreasingly popular chain.\n\nChainlink Price Feeds are available on Fantom mainnet and can be used to build\napplications on Fantom that require decentralized, tamper-proof data inputs.\nIn this technical tutorial, we\u2019ll walk you through how to build and deploy a\nsmart contract on the Fantom blockchain using price data from Chainlink\noracles.\n\n## What Is Fantom?\n\nFantom is a high-throughput blockchain with low transaction costs and instant\nfinality. Due to its EVM compatibility, it\u2019s used by many Ethereum developers\nas a way to scale their dApps. Ethereum developers can easily deploy their\nexisting contracts with standard Ethereum developer tools while using a faster\nblockchain, increasing the variety of the types of dApps they are able to\nbuild.\n\n## Building With Fantom\n\nBuilding and deploying contracts on Fantom is just as easy as doing so on\nEthereum or other EVM-compatible chains. The first step is to choose a\ndevelopment framework that allows you to launch your contracts on-chain. In\nthis tutorial we\u2019ll be using Remix, but feel free to use any other Solidity-\nbased tool, such as Hardhat, Brownie, or Truffle.\n\n## Building the Contract\n\nThe first thing we\u2019ll need to do is to import the necessary Chainlink contract\nfor price feeds, Aggrega\u2192rV3Interface.solAggrega\u2192rV3Interface.sol, which\ncontains the interface for retrieving data from existing pre-aggregated\ndecentralized price feeds. To use this interface, we need to know where the\nprice feeds are located\u2014this detail can be found in the Chainlink Fantom Feeds\ndocumentation. We\u2019re using the address for the FTM/USD feed, so we can simply\ninitialize the price feed interface with that address as its only parameter\nwhen the contract is constructed, like so:\npriceFeed=Aggrega\u2192rV3Interface(0xe04676B9A9A2973BCb0D1478b5E1E9098BBB7f3D);priceFeed=Aggrega\u2192rV3Interface(0xe04676B9A9A2973BCb0D1478b5E1E9098BBB7f3D);\n\n    \n    \n    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n    pragma solidity 0.8;\n    \n    import \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\n    \n    contract FantomLinkFeeds {\n    \n        AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;\n    \n        /**\n        * Network: Fantom Testnet\n        * Aggregator: FTM/USD\n        * Address: 0xe04676B9A9A2973BCb0D1478b5E1E9098BBB7f3D\n        * URL: https://docs.chain.link/docs/fantom-price-feeds/\n        */\n        constructor() {\n            priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0xe04676B9A9A2973BCb0D1478b5E1E9098BBB7f3D);\n        }\n    \n        /**\n        * Returns the latest price\n        */\n        function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {\n        (\n            uint80 roundID, \n            int price,\n            uint startedAt,\n            uint timeStamp,\n            uint80 answeredInRound\n        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();\n            return price;\n        }\n    }\n\nOnce initialized, we can get the latest price data from the aggregator\ninterface by calling its function, latestRoundData()latestRoundData(), as seen\nin \u2265tLatestPriceData()\u2265tLatestPriceData(). This returns multiple points of\ninformation about the feed, but it\u2019s only the price we care about, so we\nreturn just that. Since the function is not modifying anything and is just\nreading data from the aggregator interface, it\u2019s defined as a view function,\nwhich fortunately does not require gas.\n\n## Deploying the Contract\n\nDeploying this code is simple and, thanks to Fantom\u2019s EVM compatibility,\nthere\u2019s very little change required from the standard Ethereum deployment\npath. Start by compiling the contract in Remix under the Compiler tab\u2014simply\nclick \u201cCompile FantomLinkFeeds.sol\u201d. Then, proceed to the Deploy tab, set the\nenvironment to Injected Web3 (MetaMask), and configure your MetaMask for\nFantom\u2019s testnet. To do this, simply add these settings into your MetaMask\nnetworks as a \u201cCustom RPC\u201d.\n\nSelect Custom RPC on MetaMask\n\n**Network Name:** Fantom testnet\n\n**New RPC URL:** https://rpc.testnet.fantom.network/\n\n**ChainID:** 0xfa2\n\n**Symbol** : FTM\n\nCustom RPC Set Up\n\nThen proceed to faucet.fantom.network to retrieve some free testnet FTM for\ndeploying your contract. For more info on this setup process, you can view the\nFantom Documentation (you can also get testnet LINK from the Chainlink\nFaucet).\n\nNow that the contract has been compiled, your network is set to Fantom\ntestnet, and your address is funded with testnet FTM, you can deploy to the\nnetwork simply by selecting the Fan\u2192mL\u2208kFeedsFan\u2192mL\u2208kFeeds contract and\nclicking Deploy. Your contract is now live on Fantom testnet and ready to\nconsume real-world data using Chainlink.\n\nDeploying to Fantom\n\nSimply call the \u2265tLatestPrice\u2265tLatestPrice function and you\u2019ll see the FTM/USD\nresponse returned with eight decimals of precision, the value here being\n$2.66.\n\nWith a simple import, a constructor that initializes the feed, and a single\nfunction to read the price data\u2014all without paying any gas\u2014you have empowered\nyour smart contract with Chainlink\u2019s industry-standard price data.\n\n## Summary\n\nFantom is an attractive prospect for developers coming from the Ethereum-based\necosystem due to its combination of EVM compatibility, high speed, and low\ncost. When combined with Chainlink decentralized oracle networks, Fantom\nbecomes even more powerful, with developers able to use off-chain data and\nevents. Chainlink Price Feeds offer high-quality aggregated price data that\ncan be used in all kinds of useful applications, such as money markets,\nalgorithmic stablecoins, derivatives, prediction markets, and asset management\nplatforms.\n\nNow that you know how to build and deploy smart contracts with Fantom, you can\nexplore the chain in more depth or work with other EVM-compatible chains, such\nas Polygon, xDai, or other sidechains and layer-2 solutions which use the same\ntooling we used in this tutorial. If you prefer Hardhat, Brownie, or Truffle,\ntry using one of the Chainlink Starter Kits to kickstart your development\njourney.\n\nLearn more about Chainlink by visiting chain.link or read the documentation at\ndocs.chain.link.
