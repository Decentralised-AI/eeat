But just in case: ChatGPT is an AI-driven chatbot that uses natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) and deep learning to generate conversations that\nsound like they\u2019re coming from a person. The chatbot can do things like write\ntext, come up with ideas, answer questions, and more.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll walk you through the step-by-step process of building an\nAI chatbot without writing a single line of code. It\u2019s true: no Javascript, no\nPython, no need for Github. All you need is a Microsoft Azure account and\nBubble\u2019s visual web editor to build all the core features of a ChatGPT clone,\nincluding a chat function, a running history of your \u201cconversation,\u201d and a\nbackend powered by artificial intelligence that uses natural language\nprocessing to talk back.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re looking to leverage generative AI to build a purpose-\nspecific chatbot using your prompt engineering skills, or you\u2019re just\ninterested in tapping into the power of Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service\u2019s large\nlanguage model (LLM), let\u2019s dive in \u2014 it\u2019s easier than you think.\n\nThe steps to building a ChatGPT clone with no-code include:\n\n  1. Gather the tools you\u2019ll need for your ChatGPT clone\n  2. Install the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service Chatbot Template\n  3. Deploy a large language model through Azure OpenAI Service\n  4. Configure the template to connect to your LLM\n  5. Build out additional features\n  6. Add privacy and security\n  7. Launch\n  8. Start building today\n\n## **Gather the tools you\u2019ll need for your ChatGPT clone**\n\nFirst, if you haven\u2019t already, you\u2019ll need to create a free Bubble account.\nClick the button below to get started so that you can follow along as we build\nthis web app together.\n\nCreate a free Bubble account\n\n(New to Bubble? Check out our introductory videos to get familiar with the\nbasics of our visual web editor.)\n\nWe\u2019ll start this project using the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service Chatbot\nTemplate. This Bubble template comes pre-configured with an input box and\nsubmit button for sending requests (messages) to the chatbot, plus a repeating\ngroup to display the chatbot\u2019s responses. The repeating group shows a\nscrollable history of your chat, as well:  \n\n **Note:** You must also have a Microsoft Azure account _and_ access to the\nAzure OpenAI Service to use their AI models in your Bubble app \u2014 including to\ncomplete this tutorial. Right now, Azure is only granting access to users with\na business domain email address, but we\u2019re hoping to open it up to all Bubble\nusers as soon as we can.\n\n  * If you don't have an Azure account, you can create one here\n  * More information on gaining access to Azure OpenAI Service can be found here\n\n##  **Install the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service Chatbot Template**\n\nStart by adding the free template to your Bubble account. Then navigate to the\n**Templates** area of your account, find the template, and click _Start an\napp_. In the pop-up dialogue box that appears, make sure you choose Azure\nOpenAI Service Chatbot as the template to start from. Give your new Bubble app\na name and click _Get started_.\n\nOnce your app loads, follow the steps under _Get started on the right foot_ to\nconfigure your app\u2019s favicon, name, font, and color settings. When you get to\nstep 4, keep it simple for now and don\u2019t add additional plugins to your app.\n\nYour Bubble app will load in **design mode**. Click the X on the _Build a\nlanding page_ popup to close it, and close the **component library** as well.\n\nYou should now see the template loaded into your app:\n\nThe upper portion of the template is pre-filled with instructions for creating\nthe chatbot (which we\u2019re about to explain in detail, and which you\u2019ll delete\nat the end). The lower portion contains the on-page elements that the app\nactually uses.\n\nOK \u2014 once you have the template open (and an Azure account with OpenAI Service\naccess), you\u2019re ready to deploy a model.\n\n## **Deploy a large language model through Azure OpenAI Service**\n\nOpen a new browser tab or window and navigate to https://portal.azure.com,\nthen log in to your account. If you\u2019ve already set up Azure OpenAI Service and\ndeployed a model, skip ahead to the next section to connect your template to\nthe model.\n\nIf not, you\u2019ll need to set up and configure a GPT deployment on Azure OpenAI\nService. Microsoft has a step-by-step guide to walk you through the process.\n\nOnce your model is deployed, you\u2019re ready to connect it to your Bubble app.\n\n## **Configure the template to connect to your LLM**\n\nThe beauty of this template \u2014 and the Azure OpenAI Service Plugin that comes\nwith it \u2014 is that there\u2019s no need to set up an API connection between the two\nservices from scratch. Instead, connecting your Bubble app to your OpenAI\nmodel is a simple matter of copying key information from your Azure account\nand pasting it into the correct fields in your Bubble app.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n **1\\. From your Azure account, click the _Search resources, services, and\ndocs (G+/)_ search box.**\n\n **2\\. Type \u201copenai.\u201d**\n\n **3\\. Click _Azure OpenAI_.**\n\n **4\\. Select the resource that you want to use with the plugin. This is the\nmodel you deployed earlier \u2014 you should recognize it by the name you gave\nit.**\n\n **5\\. Click _Keys and Endpoint_.**\n\n **6\\. Click the _Copy to clipboard_ button for Key 1.**\n\n **7\\. Switch to your Bubble app, open the plugin settings, and paste the key\ninto both the _api-key (shared headers)_ and _api-key (shared headers) - dev_\ntext boxes.**\n\n **8\\. Switch back to your Azure OpenAI Service _Keys and Endpoints_ tab.\nClick the _Copy to clipboard_ button for Endpoint.**\n\n **9\\. Switch to your Bubble app and paste the endpoint into both the\n_endpoint (path)_ and _endpoint (path) - dev_ text boxes.**\n\n **10\\. Switch back to your Azure OpenAI Service tab and click _Model\nDeployments_.**\n\n **11\\. Click the _Manage Deployments_ button to go to Azure OpenAI Studio.**\n\n **12\\. If necessary, select the directory and subscription, then the resource\nused in the previous steps. Then, click _Deployments_ from the _Management_\ngroup.**\n\n **13\\. Copy the name of your desired deployment to the clipboard.**\n\n **14\\. Switch to your Bubble app and paste the deployment name into both the\n_deployment-id (path)_ and _deployment-id (path) - dev_ text boxes.**\n\n **15\\. That\u2019s it! Click _Preview_ to see your app in action.**\n\n **16\\. Use Bubble\u2019s easy-to-use design tools to customize the look and feel\nof your chatbot. For example, after a little editor magic:**\n\n **17\\. Test your new chatbot out! You can look at the workflows to see how\nthe plugin works with the web app and interacts with the APIs.**\n\nCongrats \u2014 you've created a ChatGPT clone without any code!\n\n##  **Build out additional features**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your basic chatbot set up, start to play around and get\ncreative with the experience you build. Here are a few ideas to consider:\n\n  * Add the ability to save conversations with the chatbot into a searchable library\n  * Create tailored chatbot prompts in Bubble's workflow tab to focus your chatbot on certain tasks and contexts\n  * Build features that match your chatbot\u2019s intended use case (for example, if the chatbot is meant to help people write, you could create preset chat personas like coach, comedian, or translator to customize the experience)\n  * Change what happens as a user waits for the chatbot\u2019s response (for example, you could ddd a loading state indicator, like an hourglass that turns over and over. Or, you could add streaming so that your user can read along as the chatbot \u201ctypes\u201d)\n  * Connect to a speech-to-text API and add a microphone icon so users can dictate their questions\n  * If you really want to level up, you can train your chatbot on a certain set of data (say, your website\u2019s FAQs) via \u201cfine tuning\u201d \n\n## **Add privacy and security**\n\nDon't forget to start setting some privacy rules and conditions to keep your\nusers\u2019 data secure \u2014 starting with roles in the **Privacy** section of your\ndata tab. You can also check if you're unintentionally exposing any data with\nan API checker.\n\n##  **Launch**\n\nOnce it\u2019s time to launch, you\u2019ll need a paid Bubble plan, which start at $29 a\nmonth. These allow you to make your app live for external users, host the app\non your own custom domain, and more. If you\u2019ve added other plugins to your\napp, those may come with their own subscriptions \u2014 but don\u2019t worry, you can\nbuild all the functionality of ChatGPT above without any additional costs.\n\n##  **Start building today**\n\nReady to join the no-code movement?
