And then a few days later, I got this second email\nfrom someone I\u2019ve known for many years.\n\n> I noticed you launched a new project called CustomGPT. I\u2019m working with a\n> former Harvard professor on a project and was wondering if CustomGPT would\n> be a fit.\n>\n> We are essentially looking to turn all of his previous works, talks, and\n> dissertations and turn them into a chatbot where you can ask the professor\n> any question.\n\nOk \u2013 that\u2019s it \u2014 so what better way than to clone myself as a test.\n\n> So without further ado, let\u2019s do it!\n\n## Why Clone Yourself ?\n\n  1. **Preservation of Knowledge and Insights**\n\nBy building an AI clone of yourself, you are essentially preserving your\nknowledge, perspectives, and experiences in a way that is accessible and\ninteractive. This can be incredibly useful for people looking to tap into your\nexpertise, even when you\u2019re not directly available. It\u2019s like leaving a\ncognitive legacy that can be referred to at any time.\n\n  2. **Scalable Mentoring and Communication**\n\nIf you\u2019re a person of influence, a leader, or an expert in your field, chances\nare there are many people who want to learn from you or seek your advice. An\nAI clone of yourself allows for your guidance to be shared on a larger scale,\nwithout the limitations of your personal time and energy. It can provide\nmentorship, offer advice, or engage in discussions based on your ideas and\nphilosophies.\n\n  3. **Self-reflection and Growth**\n\nThe process of building an AI clone of oneself can be an exercise in self-\ndiscovery and reflection. It forces you to distill your thoughts, ideas, and\nknowledge into a format that can be understood by an AI model. This not only\nhelps to clarify your own understanding of what you know and believe but also\nprovides you an opportunity to reevaluate and potentially grow from this\nintrospection.\n\n## Why CustomGPT To Clone Yourself?\n\nWhile some might think that this is a daunting task, you can do this easily\nnow with CustomGPT thanks to certain key features:\n\n### **No hallucinations**\n\nCustomGPT operates with your trusted data that you ingest \u2014 and makes sure\nthat ChatGPT does not hallucinate, without making up facts! Let\u2019s read that\nagain: _**Without making up facts**_. This is important because you dont want\nyour clone saying things outside of your knowledgebase. This is one of\nCustomGPT\u2019s biggest USPs and the reason thousands of businesses trust\nCustomGPT for their ChatGPT chatbots.\n\n### Multi-source data integration\n\nCustomGPT has built myriad tools to help your ingest your data from various\nsources. When cloning yourself, this is the hardest part \u2014 because you want to\ningest your public data from various sources like websites, social media,\nYoutube videos, PDFs, Google results, etc. So you need a platform that has\ntaken care of this hard part for you.\n\n  1. \n\n### Business-grade cloud-hosted secure platform\n\nFor something as sensitive as this, you want a business grade platform that is\nprivacy-preserving and secure. While some of your data might already be\npublic, you want a privacy-preserving platform to review the queries being\nasked of your chatbot and gather intelligence from them (something which\nCustomGPT now supports out of the box)\n\n## How To Clone Yourself Using ChatGPT And CustomGPT\n\nNow this is the amazing part \u2014 you probably started reading this blog post\nthinking that something like this would take days \u2014 no, it can be done in\nminutes.\n\n### **Step 1: Accumulate your data sources**\n\nThe first thing is to decide what you want ingested. For example, I decided to\nuse myself as a guinea pig and create a consolidated chatbot with all the\npublicly available information about me. Here are the data sources I added:\n\n  1. List of Google search results that show up for my name.\n  2. Various public documents (like my resume)\n  3. Deep search results for my name (from Facebook, Twitter, Cricinfo, etc)\n  4. Youtube videos\n\nOne piece of advice: Please do decide what data you want ingested and whether\nyou want it kept private or public. This part is important. If you plan on\nmaking your chatbot public, make sure you ingest only public data.\n\nNinja Move: Now with CustomGPT\u2019s realtime data indexing, you can even ingest\nrealtime data as it is happening and have the chatbot respond based on that.\nJust imagine the possibilities of that.\n\n**Step 2: Add the sources to your CustomGPT chatbot**\n\nNow that you have nice sitemaps representing each source or a list of\ndocuments/files, you add them to your CustomGPT chatbot using the data\nintegration feature. Do note: you dont need any coding experience for this.\nJust use the \u201cAdd Sitemap\u201d or the \u201cAdd Files\u201d button and let it rip.\n\n**Step 3: Start talking!**\n\nWithin minutes, you can then start talking to the chatbot using the \u201cAsk Me\nAnything!\u201d button. That\u2019s it. You are done!\n\nYou can then decide how you want to use your chatbot. By default, it is\nprivate. But you can share it publicly, put it on your website, let people\nchat with it using Livechat or even integrate it into your systems using the\nAPI.\n\n## Live Example and Demo\n\nYou can see the live demo hosted on this page or query it using the live\nchatbot widget below. You could even register a new website and embed the\nchatbot on it \u2013 just imagine the possibilities of that.\n\nStart a New Conversation\n\n## FAQ\n\n**1\\.

The actual time can vary depending on the\namount of the data.\n\n**6\\. Q: What types of data can I use to train my AI clone?**\n\nA: You can use a wide range of data sources, such as webpages, Google search\nresults, PDFs, Word documents, social media posts, videos, podcasts, etc.\n\n**7\\.

You\ncan even use Zapier and create workflows based on the API, thus connecting it\nto other platforms and integrations.\n\n**8\\. Q: Can the AI clone answer new questions or only those based on the\ningested data?**\n\nA: The AI clone will ONLY answer questions based on the data \u2014 without\nhallucinating. It will not \u201cmake up\u201d answers or generate responses based on\ninformation it has not indexed.\n\n**9\\. Q: How does the AI clone know to respond in my style?**\n\nA: Using CustomGPT\u2019s new \u201cPersona\u201d feature, you can define the style that you\nwant the chatbot to respond in. For example: You can can define \u201cInherit the\nstyle and personality of the information provided\u201d and it will inherit your\nstyle of communication and emulate that in its responses.\n\n**10\\. Q: Can anyone build an AI clone of themselves?**\n\nA: Yes, if you\u2019re comfortable with providing enough of your public data and\nwritings to index, you can create an AI clone of yourself. You don\u2019t need any\nspecial technical skills, as CustomGPT is a no-code system designed to be\nuser-friendly and accessible.\n\n**11\\. Q: I can do this using OpenAI LLM. Why use CustomGPT?**  \nA: For the same reason that you don\u2019t dig your own well for water. Or run your\nown servers in your basement. CustomGPT has spent 10,000+ hours building the\ndata integration and chatbot services required on top of ChatGPT. And you get\na business-grade privacy-preserving secure platform that takes care of all the\ntechnical details for you.\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\nOur Youtube channel has a host of video tutorials to help you ingest various\ndata sources, but for this one, you might like to see this tutorial on\nbuilding from the webpages you see for your name in Google.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, there we have it.
