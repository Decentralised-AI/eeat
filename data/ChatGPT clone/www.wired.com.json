Competing projects and open-\nsource clones may soon make ChatGPT-style bots available for anyone to copy\nand reuse.\n\nStability AI, a startup that has already developed and open-sourced advanced\nimage-generation technology, is working on an open competitor to ChatGPT. \u201cWe\nare a few months from release,\u201d says Emad Mostaque, Stability\u2019s CEO. A number\nof competing startups, including Anthropic, Cohere, and AI21, are working on\nproprietary chatbots similar to OpenAI\u2019s bot.\n\nThe impending flood of sophisticated chatbots will make the technology more\nabundant and visible to consumers, as well as more accessible to AI\nbusinesses, developers, and researchers. That could accelerate the rush to\nmake money with AI tools that generate images, code, and text.\n\nEstablished companies like Microsoft and Slack are incorporating ChatGPT into\ntheir products, and many startups are hustling to build on top of a new\nChatGPT API for developers. But wider availability of the technology may also\ncomplicate efforts to predict and mitigate the risks that come with it.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s beguiling ability to provide convincing answers to a wide range of\nqueries also causes it to sometimes make up facts or adopt problematic\npersonas. It can help out with malicious tasks such as producing malware code,\nor spam and disinformation campaigns.\n\nAs a result, some researchers have called for deployment of ChatGPT-like\nsystems to be slowed while the risks are assessed. \u201cThere is no need to stop\nresearch, but we certainly could regulate widespread deployment,\u201d says Gary\nMarcus, an AI expert who has sought to draw attention to risks such as\ndisinformation generated by AI. \u201cWe might, for example, ask for studies on\n100,000 people before releasing these technologies to 100 millions of people.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\nEnglish Teacher Grades Homework By ChatGPT\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 26 Best Gadgets From CES 2024 You Can Buy Right Now\n\nGear Team\n\n  * Business\n\nWhy Crypto Idealogues Won\u2019t Touch Bitcoin ETFs\n\nJoel Khalili\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Big Problem With the Giant Stanley Cup\n\nElana Klein\n\n  * Security\n\nChild Abusers Are Getting Better at Using Crypto to Cover Their Tracks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * \n\nWider availability of ChatGPT-style systems, and release of open-source\nversions, would make it more difficult to limit research or wider deployment.\nAnd the competition between companies large and small to adopt or match\nChatGPT suggests little appetite for slowing down, but appears instead to\nincentivize proliferation of the technology.\n\nLast week, LLaMA, an AI model developed by Meta\u2014and similar to the one at the\ncore of ChatGPT\u2014was leaked online after being shared with some academic\nresearchers. The system could be used as a building block in the creation of a\nchatbot, and its release sparked worry among those who fear that the AI\nsystems known as large language models, and chatbots built on them like\nChatGPT, will be used to generate misinformation or automate cybersecurity\nbreaches. Some experts argue that such risks may be overblown, and others\nsuggest that making the technology more transparent will in fact help others\nguard against misuses.  \n\nMeta declined to answer questions about the leak, but company spokesperson\nAshley Gabriel provided a statement saying, \u201cWhile the model is not accessible\nto all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the\ncurrent release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness.\u201d\n\nChatGPT is built on top of text-generation technology that has been available\nfor several years and learns to mirror human text by picking up on patterns in\nenormous quantities of text, much of it scraped from the web. OpenAI found\nthat adding a chat interface and providing an additional layer of machine\nlearning that involved humans providing feedback on the bot\u2019s responses made\nthe technology more capable and articulate.\n\nThe data provided by users interacting with ChatGPT, or services built on it\nsuch as Microsoft\u2019s new Bing search interface, may provide OpenAI a key\nadvantage. But other companies are working on replicating the fine-tuning that\ncreated ChatGPT.\n\n### Science\n\nYour weekly roundup of the best stories on health care, the climate crisis,\ngenetic engineering, robotics, space, and more.

Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, a startup that\ncarries out data labeling and machine-learning training for many technology\ncompanies, says many customers are asking for help doing fine-tuning similar\nto what OpenAI did to create ChatGPT. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty overwhelmed with demand,\u201d\nhe says.\n\nWang believes that the efforts already underway will naturally mean many more\ncapable language models and chatbots emerging. \u201cI think there will be a\nvibrant ecosystem,\u201d he says.\n\nSean Gourley, CEO of Primer, a startup that sells AI tools for intelligence\nanalysts, including those in the US government, and an adviser to Stability\nAI, also expects to soon see many projects make systems like ChatGPT. \u201cThe\nwatercooler talk is that this took about 20,000 hours of training,\u201d he says of\nthe human feedback process that honed OpenAI\u2019s bot.\n\nGourley estimates that even a project that involved several times as much\ntraining would cost a few million dollars\u2014affordable to a well-funded startup\nor large technology company. \u201cIt's a magical breakthrough,\u201d Gourley says of\nthe fine-tuning that OpenAI did with ChatGPT. \u201cBut it's not something that\nisn't going to be replicated.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 26 Best Gadgets From CES 2024 You Can Buy Right Now\n\nGear Team\n\n  * Business\n\nWhy Crypto Idealogues Won\u2019t Touch Bitcoin ETFs\n\nJoel Khalili\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Big Problem With the Giant Stanley Cup\n\nElana Klein\n\n  * Security\n\nChild Abusers Are Getting Better at Using Crypto to Cover Their Tracks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * \n\nWhat happened after OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a tool for generating complex,\naesthetically pleasing images from a text prompt in April 2022 may foreshadow\nthe path ahead for ChatGPT-like bots.\n\nOpenAI implemented safeguards on its image generator to prevent users from\nmaking sexually explicit or violent images, or ones featuring recognizable\nfaces, and only made the tool available to a limited number of artists and\nresearchers for fear that it might be abused. Yet because the techniques\nbehind DALL-E were well known among AI researchers, similar AI art tools soon\nappeared. Four months after DALL-E 2 was released, Stability AI released an\nopen-source image generator called Stable Diffusion that has been folded into\nnumerous products but also adapted to generate images prohibited by OpenAI.\n\nClement Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a company that hosts open-source AI\nprojects, including some developed by Stability AI, believes it will be\npossible to replicate ChatGPT, but he doesn\u2019t want to predict when.\n\n\u201cNobody knows, and we\u2019re still at the learning phase,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never\nreally know that you have a good model before you have a good model,\u201d he says.\n\u201cCould be next week, could be next year.\u201d Neither is very far off.\n\n## You Might Also Like \u2026\n\n  * \ud83d\udce7 Find the best bargains on quality gear with our Deals newsletter\n\n  * You know it\u2019s a placebo.
