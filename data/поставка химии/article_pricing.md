When comparing pricing plans for chemical supply, it's important to consider factors such as product range, delivery options, pricing structure, and customer support. Let's compare the pricing plans of two leading chemical suppliers, Company A and Company B, to see which one offers the best value for your needs.

|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Product Range       | Wide range of chemicals and reagents | Specializes in specific chemical types|
| Delivery Options    | Standard and expedited shipping      | Limited to standard shipping         |
