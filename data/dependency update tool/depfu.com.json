When managing quite a few repos across Baremetrics,\nit really helps keep on top of updates and security patches.\"\n\nScott Robertson \u2014 Software Engineer, Baremetrics\n\n\"Before I was always running bundle outdated first thing in the morning, but\nit was up to me to actually remember. With Depfu I wake up to PRs that I can\nact on right away.\"\n\nRobin Mehner \u2014 Freelance Developer\n\n## A lightweight process for updating  \ndependencies that actually works\n\n### Get notified about new versions right where you work \u2014 with a pull request\n\nThe number of open PRs is limited and Depfu adapts to your pace so we never\noverwhelm you or your CI system with updates.\n\nBy default we send one PR per new version, but you can also get weekly or\nmonthly PRs updating several dependencies at once.\n\n* * *\n\nUpdating becomes part of your day-to-day workflow \u2014 instead of a boring,\neasily forgotten task.\n\n### The PR has all the info you need to make an informed decision about a\ndependency update\n\nWe collect everything from security advisories, release notes to all commits\nfor that version. We even parse the changelog to extract the details of a\nsingle version.\n\nTogether with your build status, you can easily judge the risk of that update.\n\n* * *\n\nThe vast majority of updates can be done by just clicking that merge button \u2014\nyou stay in control.\n\n### Depfu figures out the minimum number of updates you need to keep you\nreasonably up-to-date\n\nThere is no value in being on all the latest versions, you just want your\ndependencies to stay current. It's called bleeding edge for a reason.\n\nThe Depfu scheduler \"matures\" new versions depending on the library's past\nrelease frequency instead of opening a PR right away.\n\n* * *\n\nThis reduces the number of PRs per week compared to sending you every new\nversion by roughly 50% \u2014 sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\n## Does this sound familiar?\n\n  * Your process for dependency updates is \u201cwhenever someone on the team has some extra time\u201d.\n  * You're a bit behind and would have to update a lot of things at the same time if there is a security vulnerability in one of your dependencies.\n  * Upgrading dependencies is too easily ignored over more visible work \u2014 it's a pretty boring and thankless job.\n\n## Depfu's continuous updates keep your  \napp secure and maintainable\n\n  * Doing small, easy to assess updates continuously is a lot easier than falling behind and having to update a big batch at once.\n  * Depfu notifies you about security releases and ensures you are able to apply and deploy them as quickly as possible.\n  * We help you bring even really out-of-date apps slowly up to speed. At your own pace, without overwhelming you with PRs.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\n#### All plans start with a 21-day free trial\n\nStart using Depfu\n\n#### Or read more  \nabout the details\n\nSee how Depfu works\n\n\"Depfu is a great tool that helps you to reduce the stress of periodically\nchecking dependency updates, with the risk to miss important releases.
