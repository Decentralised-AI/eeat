Or save a\n_further_ 50% or more with interruptible instances using spot auction based\npricing.\n\nPick your security level\n\nVast has an array of providers that offer different levels of security: from\nhobbyists up to Tier-4 data centers. Vast.ai helps you find the best pricing\nfor the level of security and reliability you need.\n\nGUI and CLI\n\nUse our command line interface to search the entire marketplace for offers\nwhile utilizing scriptable filters and sort options. Launch instances quickly\nright from the CLI and easily automate your deployment.\n\nReal-time bidding system\n\nSave an additional 50% or more by using interruptible instances and auction\npricing. The highest bidding instances run; other conflicting instances are\nstopped.\n\n## Talk to Us\n\nDo you have GPU computing needs and want help deploying it on our cost-\neffective infrastructure? Or just want to chat? We are here to help! Let us\nknow more about your project and we can customize a solution to fit your\nneeds. Use the Crisp chat in the lower right or discord or email:\n\nEmail us at support@vast.aiJoin our Discord server\n\nDLPerf\n\n## Real-time Automatic Benchmarking\n\nPicking the right GPU server hardware is itself a challenge. DLPerf (Deep\nLearning Performance) - is our own scoring function that predicts hardware\nperformance ranking for typical deep learning tasks. We help automate and\nstandardize the evaluation and ranking of myriad hardware platforms from\ndozens of datacenters and hundreds of providers.\n\nOne Interface\n\n## for Transparent Pricing\n\nEach cloud compute provider has their own interface, naming convention and\npricing systems that make direct comparison shopping difficult. Vendor lock-in\nfurther entrenches higher pricing once you select a single vendor. VAST\u2019s\nsearch interface allows for fair comparison from all kinds of providers, from\nhobbyists to Tier 4 data centers. Start saving 4-6X today and get setup on a\nsingle interface that connects you to a VAST marketplace.\n\n## Tapping the vast power of Decentralized Compute\n\nToday most of the world's general compute power consists of GPUs used for\ncryptocurrency mining or gaming. Due to new ASICs and other shifts in the\necosystem causing declining profits these GPUs need new uses. Vast simplifies\nthe process of renting out machines, allowing anyone to become a cloud compute\nprovider resulting in much lower prices.\n\n## Choose Your Security Level\n\nVast gives you control over the level of security you require for your tasks.\nFrom lower-cost hobbyist providers with consumer GPUs up to Tier 4 data\ncenters with enterprise GPUs, Vast.ai lets you choose providers to meet your\nsecurity needs.\n\n## Democratizing AI\n\nMachine learning is progressing towards powerful AI with the potential to\nradically reshape the future. We believe it is imperative that this awesome\npower be distributed widely; that its benefits accrue to the many rather than\nthe few; that its secrets are unlocked for the good of all humanity. Towards\nthese ends we work to ensure that the compute powering AI is supplied by the\npeople and for the people.\n\n  * Solutions\n  * Hosting\n  * Console\n\n  * Resources\n  * Docs\n  * Pricing\n  * Careers\n  * FAQ\n\n  * Community\n  * GitHub\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n\n  * Legal\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Data Processing\n\n  * Contact\n  * Get in Touch\nJoin mailing list\n\n  * All the answers you need in 24h or less.\n\n",
