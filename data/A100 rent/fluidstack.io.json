If you think this applies to you, please get in touch with\nsales@fluidstack.io and provider further information on your server\nrequirements and workload.  \n  \nOtherwise you can spin up instances by the minute directly from our console\nfor as low as $0.5/hr. Try us out!\n\n### Can I just check the latency of the machine and then rent it?\n\nYes, just rent the server for a few minutes to check this - for as low as\n$0.50/hr.  \n  \nTo minimise latency, you will have to pick a server location as close as\npossible to you. Luckily, our servers span the entire globe, so you will\ndefinitely find a machine in your vicinity.  \n\u200d  \nIf you have more questions about latency, please get in touch with our support\nteam through our live-chat or by email at support@fluidstack.io, as this can\nvary from server to server.\n\n### Which payment methods do you accept?\n\nWe only accept debit or credit card payments for now. For long-term or bulk\nrent purchases we can also work with direct bank to bank transfers such as\nACH. Please get in touch with sales@fluidstack.io if you\u2019d like to explore\nthis option.\n\n### How long does it take to get access to the machine I purchased?\n\nIf you are renting an hourly machine in the US through our instant deployment\nportal, you will gain access to the server within seconds. Note that it may\ntake up to 4 minutes in some cases.  \n  \nFor all other locations (including some in the US) or monthly and longer\nrentals, this will usually take less than 1 hour if purchased between Monday\nand Saturday 7am-10pm EST. Note that it may take up to 36 hours in some cases,\nbut you will be informed straight away by email by our technical team if that\nis the case.\n\n### Are your machines fully dedicated or are they spot instances?\n\nMachines are fully dedicated 24/7 to you. They will only stop when you spin\ndown the server or finish your rental period.\n\n## Data & Security\n\n### What happens to my data when I stop my subscription?\n\nWhen the rental of your server ends, we automatically destroy your VM and any\nimage you ran on. All your data would therefore be automatically erased.\nPlease beware of that and make sure to save and backup your data externally\nbefore requesting a server cancellation. FluidStack will not be held\naccountable for any data loss following a server termination request.\n\n### Do you process personal data and/or share it with third parties?\n\nWe do not process any of your data under any circumstances. We do not share\nnor sell any of your data to Third Parties either. You can request the erasure\nof your data at any time by emailing us at support@fluidstack.io.\n\n## Technicals\n\n### What is the difference between KVM Virtual Machines and bare metal\ninstances?\n\nEach bare metal machine receives a fully dedicated IP, whereas virtual\nmachines are placed in a firewalled internal network with specific ports\nforwarded in. There is a minimal performance loss of less than 3% when running\na VM compared to a bare metal server. In both cases, the GPU is fully\ndedicated to you and not shared with any other user.\n\n### Can I run crypto-mining software on the machines?\n\nMining is only allowed on consumer cards (GeForce RTX range) excluding the\nlatest RTX 30xx series range. Mining is NOT allowed on enterprise grade cards\nsuch as the Tesla V100, A100, RTX A6000 etc.  \n  \nNote that if you are caught mining on a server you are not allowed to, you\nwill immediately be removed from that server and we will not refund you for\nyour purchase as this is a serious breach of FluidStack\u2019s policy.\n\n### What if I accidentally shut down my machine?\n\nIf you accidentally shut down one of the servers you rent, please email our\ntechnical team on the support@fluidstack.io email address. Make sure to\nindicate the VM ID of the server which needs to be rebooted. One of our tech\nteam members will get your server back live as soon as possible. This\ntypically takes less than 15 minutes anytime between Monday and Saturday from\n7am to 10pm EST.\n\n### I can only see half of the number of CPU threads (vCPUs) I purchased?\n\nWorry not. All FluidStack servers come with Hyper-threading for Intel CPUs or\nmulti-threading for AMD CPUs. In both cases, this allows for 2 threads per\nphysical core (e.g. an 8 core CPU will have 16 threads). If the server you\npurchased is a VM, the number of vCPUs shown will correspond to the number of\nphysical cores, NOT to the number of threads. So even if the vCPU number\ndisplayed on your computer is half of what you expected it to be, you in\nreality still have access to double that amount of threads. If you are still\nconfused, please email support@fluidstack.io and they\u2019ll be able to better\nhelp you.\n\n## Providers & Suppliers\n\n### How and when do I get paid?\n\nWe pay our data center partners in arrears at the end of every of month via\nbank transfer or PayPal. We can also arrange other payment methods if needed.\n\n### What is an example setup I can provide?\n\nAn example machine configuration our data centers provide is:  \n\\- 4x RTX A6000 GPUs  \n\\- 2x Xeon Silver 4208 CPU (32 Threads total)  \n\\- 128 GB RAM1.0 TB NVMe + 2.0 TB GB SATA disk space  \n\\- 150 Mbps bandwidth up and down\n\n### What are the requirements to become a data center provider on FluidStack?\n\nYou must host multiple NVIDIA GPU servers in a secure environment. We prefer\nTier 2+ data centers with specific industry certifications. Interested in\nbecoming a supplier? Simply email indigo@fluidstack.io. Make sure to let us\nknow the type, quantity and location of the GPUs you have available. Learn\nmore on our data centers page.\n\n### How does the application process work?\n\nSimple. Just email us your available machines at indigo@fluidstack.io. If\naccepted, we\u2019ll advertise your available servers directly onto our website and\nyou'll get customers running on these in no time! This process can also be\nautomated by integrating directly with your own API.  \n  \nFor larger partnerships, we may set up an introductory call to maximise our\nrelationship.\n\n### How does bidding work for custom orders?\n\nWhenever a large customer requests a custom server build, you will receive an\nautomated email. This email will include all the details of the deal,\nincluding the expected delivery ETA and price points. Simply answer this email\nand provide a quote for this custom request. We aggregate all the quotes and\nwill then let you know if the customer decided to proceed with your offer.\nPlease note that responses within 24h of the custom request will be\nprioritized.\n\nHPC & AI experts we work with\n\n### Speak with an Engineer\n\nSign in\n\nSign up for Free\n\n##### GPU Cloud\n\nVirtual MachinesReserved GPU ClustersPricingSign In\n\n##### Resources\n\nAPI\n\n##### Partners\n\nData Centers\n\n##### Support\n\nFAQ\n\n#####  **Terms  \n**\n\nAcceptable UseData ProtectionTerms - UsersTerms - ProvidersTrial TermsNon-\nCircumventionSLAPrivacy Policy\n\n##### Contact\n\nEmailCall us at +44 7808 278948\n\n\u00a9 2023 FluidStack\n\n\u2022\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\u2022\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n",
