The service is powered by the Nvidia AI Enterprise\nsoftware suite and Vultr CEO J.J. Kardwell, who joined the company in late\n2020, believes that this is another point in his service\u2019s favor. \u201cIf you\nthink about the way that the big clouds deploy, they want to buy GPU hardware\nand then push their own stack, whereas we partnered very closely with Nvidia\nto deliver not just the GPU itself but the Nvidia AI Enterprise software stack\nand the full set of libraries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to get the most out of\nthe GPU \u2014 the physical GPUs \u2014 is through that Nvidia software stack \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s a very, very different approach.\u201d\n\n **Image Credits:** Vultr\n\nThe company, which also recently launched its managed Kubernetes platform into\ngeneral availability, always remained a bit under the media radar \u2014 and much\nof that was by design. It never raised a lot of outside funding since its\nlaunch in 2014 and mostly relied on word of mouth to grow to $125 million ARR\ntoday, as Kardwell told me. That\u2019s the way the company\u2019s founder, David\nAninowsky, who is now its executive chairman, wanted to build Vultr. But as\nthe company is now reaching this scale \u2014 and likely thinking about an IPO at\nsome point in the future \u2014 the team is clearly looking to elevate its profile\na bit more.\n\n\u201cWe really believe we\u2019re doing more than anyone to democratize access to cloud\ncomputing globally. And as we seek to do that, we think it\u2019s important that\npeople understand that mission,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe A100 is now available in Vultr\u2019s New Jersey data center, with other\nlocations following in the next few weeks. The company also tells me that it\nwill add other Nvidia GPUs to its lineup later this year.\n\nMore TechCrunch\n\n### Sam Altman won't return as OpenAI's CEO after all\n\n### Apple Watch Series 9 review\n\n### Google gives out offensive notebooks to Black summit attendees\n\n### The Rule of X and how cloud leaders should think about growth versus\nprofit\n\nclose\n\n### Please login to comment\n\nLogin / Create Account\n\n## TechCrunch Early Stage\n\nApril 25, 2024 Boston, MA\n\nRegister Now\n\n### Sign up for Newsletters\n\nSee all newsletters(opens in a new window)\n\nDaily\n\nWeek in Review\n\nStartups Weekly\n\nEvent Updates\n\nAdvertising Updates\n\nTechCrunch+ Announcements\n\nTechCrunch+ Events\n\nTechCrunch+ Roundup\n\nEmailSubscribe\n\nx(opens in a new window)facebook(opens in a new window)linkedin(opens in a new\nwindow)reddit(opens in a new window)mail(opens in a new window)Copy Share Link\n\ncheckmarkCopy\n\n### Tags\n\n  * cloud computing\n  * computing\n  * developers\n  * GPU\n  * graphics cards\n  * machine learning\n  * nvidia\n  * technology\n  * tensor\n  * Vultr\n\nTC\n\n## Vultr will now let you rent a share of Nvidia\u2019s A100 GPUs in its cloud\n\nFrederic Lardinois\n\n12:00 PM UTC\u2022May 24, 2022\n\nVultr, the cloud platform that specializes in providing access to basic\ninfrastructure services at a relatively low cost, today announced the launch\nof Vultr Talon, a new service that will offer de...\n\nFeatured Article\n\n## Why extortion is the new ransomware threat\n\nCybercriminals are becoming more aggressive in their effort to maximize\ndisruption and compel the...\n\nCarly Page\n\n5:00 PM UTC\u2022December 18, 2023\n\n### TechCrunch Early Stage 2024\n\n## TechCrunch Early Stage 2024 agenda first look: Engine Accelerator, Y\nCombinator, Glasswing Ventures and more will join us in Boston\n\nAlex Wilhelm\n\n4:20 PM UTC\u2022December 18, 2023\n\nTechCrunch Early Stage returns to Boston on April 25, 2024, and the agenda for\nour flagship founder event is shaping up.
