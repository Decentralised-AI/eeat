Then comes the _real_ work \u2014 making a plan, taking smaller steps\ntoward the larger goal, and, most importantly, tracking your progress.\n\nTracking and measuring progress over time is key to achieving goals \u2014 not only\ndoes it show when you're making progress (and give you a chance to course-\ncorrect if you stop progressing), it can also help hold you accountable. But\ntracking goals manually creates extra work that can stand in the way of\nforward momentum. Much better if you can automate some (or all) of that\nprocess \u2014 and that's where apps for goal tracking come in.\n\nThere are so many technology tools available to help you track general goals,\nbuild habits, or measure specific goals, from workouts and sleep patterns to\nscreen time, budgeting, and even your daily moods. Whatever goal you want to\ntrack, there's probably an app for that, and we have a list with an option for\neveryone \u2014 read on for all the details.\n\n## What is goal setting?\n\nGoal setting literally means identifying something you want to accomplish,\nthen establishing measurable goals and timeframes.\n\nThat definition isn't wrong, but it leaves out the big (and arguably, more\nimportant) part of setting goals: the work it takes to actually _achieve_\nthem. In that sense, both setting goals and _achieving_ goals are skills that\nrequire work, practice, and sacrifice as you improve at them over time.\n\nScience backs this up: studies have shown that setting and achieving goals\nactually rewires your brain chemistry. The more goals you set and work toward,\nthe more primed your brain becomes for success, and the easier it is to set\nand meet new goals. An article in _Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience\nReviews_ breaks this down, explaining how repeatedly practicing setting and\nworking toward new goals teaches your amygdala and frontal lobe to work\ntogether more efficiently, which makes you better at achieving goals over\ntime.\n\nBut not all goals are created equal. Setting achievable goals is also a skill\nthat requires practice \u2014 and a framework can help.\n\n## How to set achievable goals\n\nThe study that identified how goal-setting affects our brain chemistry also\nshowed that there are two important aspects to every goal: the emotional\n(which activates the amygdala) and the logical (which activates the frontal\nlobe).\n\nKnowing this, we can conclude that a goal-setting framework that accounts for\nboth the emotional _and_ logical aspects of achieving a goal is a good way to\nset yourself up for success. **That's a big part of why I love the SMART Goals\nframework.**\n\nThe SMART Goals framework helps narrow and focus your goals, taking them from\nideas to actionable, measurable plans toward success. To use the framework,\nyou make sure all your goals are\u2026\n\n  * Specific  \n  \n\n  * Measurable  \n  \n\n  * Actionable  \n  \n\n  * Rewarding  \n  \n\n  * Time-bound  \n\nHere's an example. Let's say I want to write a book. That goal is vague, and\ndoesn't have a clear next step. But let's adapt it so it fits the SMART Goals\nframework.\n\n  *  **Specific:** \"I want to write a book\" isn't specific. A better goal is: \"I want to write a book this year\". The best goal is: \"I want to complete a manuscript for my first novel by the end of 2022\".  \n  \n\n  *  **Measurable:** In this example, a completed manuscript is the ultimate measure of success. But that can be broken down into small milestones, like finishing outlines and chapters, to help keep your goals on track.  \n  \n\n  *  **Actionable:** With a goal to write a book, the next step isn't immediately clear. But when the goal is made more specific \u2014 to finish a manuscript by a set date \u2014 it's easier to narrow your focus and decide what to do next. In this case, the first step might be to complete an outline.  \n  \n\n  *  **Rewarding:** In this example, the motivation is mostly intrinsic \u2014 writing a book is a big accomplishment! But by planning to publish the book, there could be financial motivation as well.  \n  \n\n  *  **Time-bound:** The more specific version of this goal sets a deadline for completing the manuscript \u2014 by the start of the new year. While that deadline is a bit arbitrary in this case, it's still important to set one. Making goals time-bound creates urgency that helps propel us forward as we work on achieving them.\n\nWhether you're working on lofty long-term goals, or day-to-day ones, framing\nyour goals this way can help hone the skills you need to achieve them. And\nwhen it comes to measuring your goals and taking action, goal tracking apps\ncan help streamline the process \u2014 and motivate you to stay on track.\n\nRegain your focus and win back time with Superhuman Mail\n\nKeyboard shortcuts, AI triage, Reminders, Scheduled sends, Beautiful design\n\nGet Superhuman for Email\n\n## 17 apps for goal tracking and measuring\n\nFor general habit building, these 17 goal tracking apps are some of the most\nloved. They all offer different features, functionality, and design \u2014 meaning\nthere's something for everyone on this list. We'll start with 9 top apps for\ngeneral goal-setting, then move into 8 more apps that we love for tracking\nmore specific types of goals.\n\n### Strides\n\nAs one of the most powerful and comprehensive goal-setting apps available,\nStrides is loved by those who want to measure their progress over time. It's\nextremely easy to use, and offers daily habit reminders, regular progress\nreports, and a dashboard that displays your progress as a set of charts and\ngraphs, so you can get an update at a glance.\n\nStrides is available for iPhone or desktop iOS users.\n\n### Way of Life\n\nIf you want a visual goal tracker, you'll love Way of Life. This is an app\nthat helps reinforce good habits, _or_ banish bad habits \u2014 once you set a goal\nand associated actions, Way of Life will send daily reminders and provide bar\ncharts, pie graphs, trendlines, and other statistical measures of your\nprogress.\n\nWay of Life is available for both Android and iOS.\n\n### GoalsOnTrack\n\nWith GoalsOnTrack, it's all in the name: keeping your goals on track. In\naddition to being available either on desktop or as a mobile app, where\nGoalsOnTrack shines is in helping its users break down their goals into\nactionable subgoals that fit within the SMART Goals framework. This turns long\nterm ambitions into daily tasks so you always have a step you can take to move\nyour goal forward.\n\nGoalsOnTrack is available for iOS.\n\n### Habitica\n\nHabitica is one of the best goal tracking apps I've personally used, and the\nsecret is in how the app turns your personal goals into a game, with social\naspects and rewards to help keep you incentivized to build new habits. It\ntakes goal-setting, typically a strenuous process, and makes it a lot more\nfun.\n\nHabitica is available on Android and iOS.\n\n### Coach.me\n\nCoach.me claims to be the leading habit tracking app on the market, and\nthere's no denying that it's a popular and powerful option. What sets Coach.me\napart from many other apps that are available is the social aspect \u2014 you\nchoose the goal you want to achieve, and then you can participate in\nchallenges and network with others to get support or advice. There's also the\noption to upgrade to a premium version of the app that allows you to hire a\npersonal coach, if you really need help reaching your goals.\n\nCoach.me is available on Android and iOS.\n\n### ATracker\n\nATracker is admittedly not the best app for tracking long-term goals. But what\nit does offer is an easy habit tracker for daily goals, along with valuable\ninsights about how much time you spend either building good habits,\nreinforcing bad habits, or wasting time. It can be a good way to check in with\nyourself to better understand how you spend your time and whether you could\nbenefit from making adjustments \u2014 knowledge is power, after all!\n\nATracker is available on Android and iOS.\n\n### Toodledo\n\nToodledo is a bit more like a task manager than a habit tracker, but it's\nstill a powerful tool for people trying to reach goals. With this flexible yet\npowerful app, you can create due dates for projects, set reminders so you\ndon't miss them, put tasks on repeat, and create custom notifications to help\nkeep you on track.\n\nToodledo is available on Android and iOS.\n\n### ClickUp\n\nClickUp offers many similar features to the other goal tracker apps on this\nlist, but there's one thing that definitely sets it apart: how customizable it\nis. With ClickUp, you set your goals, then break them down into smaller\ntargets that are more achievable and easier to track. At any time you can\ncheck your progress toward different targets (or grant access to others to\nhelp you stay accountable). ClickUp also automatically generates weekly\nscorecards so you can see how you're doing.\n\nClickUp is available for Android and iOS.\n\n### ToDoist\n\nToDoist is another app that isn't specifically geared toward habit tracking,\nbut is marketed as a task management and note-taking app. But we love it\nbecause of its flexibility and simple, clean interface. You can organize\ndifferent goals as separate widgets, keep track of important documents and\nnotes, collaborate with a team, create to-do lists, see your week at a glance,\nand so much more.\n\nToDoist is available for Android and iOS.\n\n### Even more apps for tracking different types of goals\n\nIn addition to apps that are good for tracking general habits and goals, there\nare _tons_ of apps that can help you work toward a more specific goal. No\nmatter what your goal is, there's probably an app that can help you work\ntoward it \u2014 this list is far from exhaustive!\n\n#### Tracking physical health\n\nIf your goal has to do with moving more or improving your physical health,\nthere are many apps that can help. Many people find success with manually\nlogging their workouts on an app like FitOn, Strava, or MapMyRun. But for\nworkouts or sleep tracking, it can be helpful to use a tracker that stays\nattached to your body, so it never misses any data. For that, popular fitness\ntrackers like Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch are all great options.\n\nFor a goal like improving your posture or drinking more water, physical\ntrackers can also be the way to go. For example, Lumo Back has a wearable\ndevice that works with an app to track posture and help improve it over time.\nAnd HidrateSpark is a tech-enabled water bottle that can glow with different\ncolors to help remind you to drink more water, in addition to automatically\nlogging your intake on an app.\n\n#### Tracking screen time\n\nMany devices now come with built-in screen time tracking and reporting, which\ncan help you see how you spend your screen time, and decide whether and how to\nreduce it. For example, on iOS, you can go to Settings, then click Screen Time\nto get a full report breaking down the time you've recently spent on social\nnetworks, productivity apps, watching videos, and more.\n\nIf your device doesn't have screen time tracking built in (or you're after a\nmore robust set of reporting features), there are many apps that can analyze\nscreen time, like OffTime or My Addictiometer.\n\n#### Tracking your budget\n\nFinancial goals aren't uncommon \u2014 and neither are apps to help you achieve\nthem.\n\nMint, Monarch, and YNAB are a few apps that are loved by users for the way\nthey make managing personal finances and budgeting simple and straightforward.\nIf you're interested in tracking things like investments or personal wealth,\nRobin Hood is well-loved for making it easy to trade stocks and other assets\nlike crypto, while Kubera offers a sleek and modern interface for tracking all\nkinds of wealth assets.\n\n#### Tracking email\n\nReaching (and maintaining) Inbox Zero can be a helpful goal for anyone who\nwants to spend less time on email (and more time doing productive work!). For\ntracking your Inbox Zero streak, there's Superhuman.\n\nTurn your inbox into your most effective productivity tool\n\nKeyboard shortcuts, AI triage, automated follow ups, scheduled sends\n\nGet Started with Superhuman\n\n## The right technology can help achieve any goal\n\nWith all the technology tools we have available \u2014 often right at our\nfingertips on our smartphones \u2014 the likelihood is high that you'll be able to\nfind an app for goal tracking, no matter what your specific goal may be.
