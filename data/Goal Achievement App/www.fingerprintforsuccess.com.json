I\u2019ll tell you why. The average human attention\nspan is shrinking drastically. It has decreased to 8.25 seconds (down from 12\nseconds) between 2000 and 2015.1\n\nWe spend 28% of our time dealing with distractions and unnecessary\ninterruptions, especially at work.2 The average worker wastes 60 hours every\nmonth due to workplace distractions, and 80% of them are trivial.\n\nThese distractions either make us lose sight of our goals or make it too hard\nto keep track and achieve them. We need assistance for goal attainment, from\ngoal setting to progress tracking to staying on the right path.\n\nThis is where goal-tracking apps, such as Fingerprint for Success, come into\nplay. They provide effective step-by-step solutions to make the process easy\nand extra motivation to help us achieve our goals.\n\nTable of contents\n\nWhat are goal-tracking apps?\n\nWhat features to look for in goal-tracking apps?\n\nMost effective goal-tracking apps in 2024\n\nGetting the best out of your goal-tracking app\n\nFAQs\n\n## What are goal-tracking apps?\n\nGoal-tracking apps are productivity apps that help you get organized. They\nallow you to set, track, and measure progress towards your goals.\n\nFor example, imagine you're working towards a fitness goal of running a\nmarathon. You could use a goal-tracking app to break this objective into\nsmaller tasks, like weekly mileage targets, monthly goals, strength training\nsessions, and dietary goals.\n\nGoal-tracking apps help you segment your goals into smaller, more manageable\ntasks and let you visually track your journey. They are technology tools that\nmake overwhelming task lists more achievable.\n\nSee your progress over time with visual progress charts and graphs. Get\nreminders and notifications to stay on track.

For example, get married, have children.\n\n## What features to look for in goal-tracking apps?\n\nYour choice of goal-tracking app or habit-tracking app depends on the type of\ngoals you want to set and your preferences. Remember, you can\u2019t track a\nfinancial goal using a time-tracking app! However, there are certain key\nfeatures you should consider that apply universally to most habit-tracking\napps.\n\n  *  **User base/ user feedback**\n  *  **Intuitive interface** for efficiency and ease of use.\n  *  **Reminders and alerts** to stay on track and for progress monitoring.\n  *  **To-Do list feature** to break down large goals into smaller more manageable tasks.\n  *  **Progress reports over time** to record milestones and measure performance.\n  *  **Visualization tools** like visual progress charts, bar charts, and graphs to easily understand progress.  \n  *  **Habit tracking feature** to create and maintain daily or regular routines and to promote accountability.\n  *  **Pricing options:** does the app have a premium version with additional features?\n  * Is the app under active **development** , and are bugs promptly addressed and resolved?\n\n## Most effective goal-tracking apps in 2024\n\n### 1\\.
