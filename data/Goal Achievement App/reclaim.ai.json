Team accounts can be customized to allow users to join\nautomatically, request to join, or only join if they\u2019re invited. Reach out to\nus via live chat in the app if you have trouble finding your team.  \n\n **Which plan is best for my team?**\n\nOur plans are designed to scale with your team. We offer support for all\nfeatures in each of our paid plans, so you can start at the level that matches\nyour team or organization size.  \n\n **How does Reclaim's pricing work?**\n\nThe free Lite plan is available for any single user at no cost. Our paid plans\nare tiered by team size, though you can upgrade from Starter to Business to\nunlock additional features for your account. We offer a 20% discount for\nannual billing vs. monthly.  \n\n **What's special about Reclaim's smart time blocking?**\n\nSmart scheduling at Reclaim works with your existing Google Calendar to\nautomatically find the best time for your priorities across Tasks, Habits,\nmeetings, and breaks while keeping your schedule flexible.  \n  \nWhen your calendar has more availability, or there's still time before a\ndeadline, Reclaim will mark events as \"Free\" \u2014 keeping you open to last-minute\nchanges and opportunities to collaborate. As your schedule books up, Reclaim\nwill automatically lock the event as \"Busy\" so you can defend time for things\nthat are most important every week.\n\n **Can I invite people to Smart 1:1s if they're not a Reclaim user?**\n\nYes! We only require Smart 1:1 organizers to be a Reclaim user. Your invitees\nwon't have to sign up for Reclaim, so long as you have access to view their\ncalendar availability (which is common within most organizations). But, we\nencourage Smart 1:1 invitees to create a free account and set their meeting\nhours so we can make sure to schedule at a good time that works for you both!  \n\n **What forms of payment do you accept?**\n\nWe accept all major credit cards.

We partner with Stripe to automatically calculate sales tax and\ndetermine whether or not a tax should be charged.  \n\n **Does Reclaim offer any discounts?**\n\nYes! Qualified students/educators, nonprofits, and startups are eligible for\ndiscounts on any of our above list prices, including both monthly and annual\nplans.  \n\n **What if I change jobs?**\n\nAs long as your personal email is connected to your Reclaim account, you can\nsign in and continue using your personal smart calendar events once you lose\naccess to your work account. All work details will be scrubbed from your\nReclaim account for company privacy.  \n\n **Do you have a referral program?**\n\nYes! We give you credit for every single person you refer to Reclaim.
