The only reason this\nisn't a 5-star is because of a bug in the rearrange feature. When you go to\nrearrange it reverts to the original order. It would also be helpful for\nhabits to appear in the specified chronological order. Additionally, the\nhabits when listed out on the Android widget (Samsung Galaxy S21+) are not in\nchronological order and it would be helpful if they were.\n\n79 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nDreamfora\n\nNovember 30, 2023\n\nWe are truly sorry for any inconvenience caused to you. We understand that\nwhile you can rearrange dreams in the Dreamfolder, not being able to rearrange\nHabits and Tasks has been a hassle. Thank you for sharing your feedback with\nus. We appreciate it and will work on incorporating this into our product\nimprovements in the near future!\n\nJ T\n\n _more_vert_\n\n  * Flag inappropriate\n  * Show review history\n\nDecember 17, 2023\n\nUnusable - Cannot 'create dreams of any kind'. I was excited to try this app\nafter reading all the glowing reviews and upon downloading, found that\nirrespective of entering customised or preset suggestions for 'dreams',\nDreamfora throws the same error: 'Please try it again. An error occurred while\ncreating your dream'. Restarting the app does not help. In fact, sometimes it\njust freezes on splash page. Very disappointing.\n\n70 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nDreamfora\n\nDecember 17, 2023\n\nHi J T, we're sorry for the trouble. We tested the app; it works fine and\nothers with your device report no issues. Possible causes: storage, data\npermissions, network, or install errors. Please try reinstalling. If issues\npersist, email us at support@dreamfora.com with some screenshots of which you\nmet the problems.

Two stars for the fact that I have to check off my daily\ntasks several times before it actually keeps them checked off. Note: the app\nonly saves after a certain amount of seconds, so if you made changes and close\nit before then you get to repeat yourself. Results in days streak being reset\nbecause if you check things off before bed and close it, it doesn't save. Have\nhad to go back and recheck several days worth of tasks. Recommendation to the\ndeveloper: decrease save time.\n\n23 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nDreamfora\n\nJuly 13, 2020\n\nHi Kayla, We're sorry for the inconvenience!
