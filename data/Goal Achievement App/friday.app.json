I find Trello easy\nto use and implement, and it's not very difficult to get team members trained\nand onboarded. Another reason I chose Trello over other tools is that the\nprice is excellent.

What originally drew us to Hive was its seamless workflow approval\nsystem and how easily teams can collaborate on projects from wherever they're\nworking from.
