And best principles are baked into its system, like\nthe SMART methodology and Locke\u2019s goal-setting theory.\n\nIt empowers you to set goals the right way.\n\nIn a nutshell, Goals on Track guides you through defining your BIG goals,\nbreaking them into smaller subgoals, and finally, into manageable tasks and\nhabits.\n\n## Who is Goals on Track for?\n\nGoals on Track is an awesome planner if you seek a structured and organized\napproach to goal-setting and tracking. It\u2019s the best digital planner app on\nthe market for individuals.\n\nAlthough they also offer a more expensive option for teams (which I haven\u2019t\nused), **this app mainly serves as a personal goal-setting planner.**\n\nAny motivated go-getter with personal or professional goals will benefit from\nthis app, such as:\n\n  * **High-performers** , including (aspiring) leaders, results-oriented professionals, and career-driven individuals.\n  * **Solopreneurs** , including freelancers, one-person businesses, side hustlers, and independent consultants.\n  * **Creators,** including social media influencers, bloggers, artists, YouTubers, developers, or creatives in any other shape or form.\n  * **Ambitious individuals** who chase many different or challenging life goals and seek a structured approach to achieve them.\n  * **Small business owners** **and teams** may enjoy the team-based option of Goals on Track.\n\nIn short, **Goals on Track is for individuals seeking to achieve their\npersonal and professional goals.**\n\nThis planner works like magic to me. But let\u2019s take a deeper look into the\ntool so you can learn if it matches your needs too.\n\n## How does Goals on Track work?\n\nGoals on Track is a comprehensive and super-organized system to set and track\nyour goals. And while you can personalize how you use this tool, the core idea\nis simple:\n\n  1. **Set your life goals**. Goals on Track then encourages you to make your goals SMART.\n  2. **Set sub-goals** to turn BIG goals into more achievable chunks.\n  3. **Set tasks** to achieve your (sub)goals.\n  4. **Take action and complete your tasks.** Based on your settings, it will track goal progress automatically.\n\n**The benefits of this simple system?**\n\n  * BIG long-term goals provide direction;\n  * ACHIEVABLE short-term goals provide an action plan;\n  * ACTIONABLE tasks urge you to act and move forward;\n  * IMMEDIATE feedback motivates you to keep going;\n  * And the ALL-IN-ONE approach keeps everything related to your goals organized and in one place.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to it, but that\u2019s the Goals on Track system in a\nnutshell.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll dive into each of the features.\n\n## Key features of Goals on Track\n\nThere are many features in Goals on Track. And for this review, I\u2019ve split\nthese into the key and secondary features.\n\n**The key features are:**\n\n  1. Dashboard overview\n  2. Multi-level goal-setting system\n  3. Goal-tracking system\n  4. Task management system\n  5. Habit tracking system\n\nI\u2019ll walk you through each of them.\n\n### #1: Dashboard overview\n\nThe dashboard overview provides a quick snapshot of your goals, daily tasks,\nand habits. This overview is all you need on a day-to-day basis.\n\nYou can choose from a couple of different layouts, including the default\nlayout (see image), tasks first, or goals first.\n\n### #2: Multi-level goal-setting system\n\nThis feature is where the magic happens. When you create a new goal, it\nprompts different areas to help you make them SMART.\n\nIt includes:\n\n  * **Date range** to set a start date and, of course, your deadline.\n  * **Four ways to track goal progress.** More about this in the next section of this review.\n  * **SMART prompts,** including questions about your vision, purpose, obstacles, and resources for each goal.\n  * **Goal categories** enable you to keep your goals organized.\n  * **Custom images** to personalize your goals even further.\n\nYou can then set sub-goals to break up your goals.\n\nIt empowers you to think about the steps required to achieve your big and most\naudacious goals.\n\nFor example, you can have the big goal of making $100K this year.\n\nYou can then break it into smaller chunks, like landing 3 new clients this\nmonth. And even further into reaching out to 30 prospects this week.\n\nThen, you can set tasks to reach out to 6 prospects each weekday. You can even\ncreate single tasks for each person you want to approach if you like.\n\n#### How I use the goal-setting section\n\nWhile I like to set BIG 5+ year goals, I wanted to avoid a long string of\nsubgoals. Instead, I want to keep my long-term goals separate.\n\nSo, I organize them differently.\n\nFor any goal longer than one year, I use a different category called \u201c0 \u2013\nVision (or life goals)\u201d.\n\nHere I nest all my long-term goals so I can quickly review them once in a\nwhile in one overview.\n\nAlthough you can use date filters in the goals section to zoom in on your\nlong-term or short-term goals, I prefer it this way.\n\nThe numbers in the screenshot before my goals refer to the four categories\nthat I use in my goal-setting approach:\n\n  * Life\n  * Wealth\n  * Health\n  * Business\n\nBased on my long-term vision, I set yearly goals into these buckets.\n\nAnd then, at the end of the month, I review my progress and set new goals for\nthe upcoming month. I usually do this per quarter too. But I\u2019m running a few\nprojects that work better on a purely monthly basis.\n\n**These sub-goals provide a more concrete action plan, create urgency, and\nenhance focus.**\n\nInitially, the tool took some trial and error to find what worked for me. But\nalthough there was a slight learning curve, it took less than a month to find\nmy ideal workflow.\n\n### #3: Goal-tracking system\n\nI love the flexibility of the goal-tracking feature of Goals on Track.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because you can track the:\n\n  * **Number of tasks completed.** For example, I use this for the required tasks to rebrand my blog. Each task completed counts as progress towards the full rebrand.\n  * **Progress on your subgoals.** This option combines the progress of all your subgoals and shows that as your total progress.\n  * **Outcome from all your tasks.** When you complete a task, an outcome prompt pops up. Say that your goal is to make 70 calls this week, and your daily task is to make 10 calls. If you made 8 calls today, you can put that number into the outcome prompt, and it\u2019ll only add 8 to your goal progress.\n  * **And manually updating progress.** This is a great option if you\u2019ve goals without tasks. For example, every month I manually update how many website visits I got for the year.\n\nThe latter two options also provide the option to customize what you track.\nFor example, you can put a dollar sign for monetary goals or type anything\nelse, like \u201cweeks completed\u201d or \u201cblog posts written\u201d.\n\nAlthough it took some time to figure out how each tracking option worked, I\nnow use them in various ways.\n\n**The tracking option is fun, engaging, and motivating.**\n\n### #4: Task management system\n\nTasks are the activities you need to perform to achieve your goals. Here are\nthe different options you should know about:\n\n  * Goal-based tasks\n  * Task overview and ad hoc tasks\n  * Creating recurring tasks\n\n#### Goal-based tasks\n\nWhen you\u2019re setting up your goals, you can add tasks and recurring tasks.\nThen, select the date when you want to take action \u2013 and forget about it.\n\nWhen the date is near, your task appears in the upcoming tasks list.\n\nAnd when the date arrives, it shows up in your tasks of the day.\n\n**This system is powerful.**\n\nBecause it empowers you to create a step-by-step action plan to achieve your\ngoals. And it urges you to take action.\n\n#### Task overview and ad hoc tasks\n\nThe tasks section provides an overview of your tasks, sorted into four\nbuckets:\n\n  * Overdue\n  * Today\n  * Upcoming\n  * Later\n\nYour goal-based tasks show up in this section.\n\nAlternatively, you can add tasks from the task overview section, which is also\ngreat for ad hoc tasks and reminders.\n\nEvery night, I check the upcoming tasks and add any additional ad hoc tasks\nfor the next day. For example, consider working out, cooking meals, and\nvisiting a friend.\n\n#### Create recurring tasks\n\nYou can also add recurring tasks that automatically appear at the selected\ntime interval. You can add these tasks in the goal section or the task\noverview.\n\nFor example, I started in March with an updated set of habits. And I want to\nachieve 75% of my habits every week. My yearly goal is to hit that weekly\ntarget at least 33 times out of the 44 remaining weeks.\n\nI use a recurring weekly task to review my progress.\n\nThen, I add the % of habits in the task before I complete it, which prompts\nthe \u201coutcome\u201d question.\n\nWhen I complete at least 75% of my habits, I write a 1 in the outcome, which\nadds a successful week to my goal progress. Otherwise, I put a 0.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun way to keep track of my habits and drive action.\n\n#### Completing tasks\n\nWhen you complete tasks that are attached to goals, a prompt pops up to add\nyour outcome, which is then added to your goal-progress.\n\nYou can use this for monetary values, website visits, sales, number of phone\ncalls, or in other creative ways like I did with my habits.\n\n**Additionally, you can allocate time for each task. And upon completion, you\ncan track how much time you spend.  **\n\nTotal time spent shows up in your progress report.\n\n### #5: Habit tracking system\n\nI\u2019ve always used goal-setting planners that contained a habit-tracking section\nor space that I could turn into one.\n\nAnd I love that Goals on Track has an integrated habit tracker.\n\nYou can even attach habits to your goals.\n\nHowever, I use it as a standalone section and, as mentioned before, have a\nhabit-related goal with a recurring weekly task to track progress.\n\nThe only downside of the habit tracker is that it focuses on building new\nhabits. While it tracks your habit-building progress, it\u2019s limited to 100\ndays.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what happens if you complete 100 days.\n\nMaybe you can no longer track the habit. Or maybe the progress bar is\ncomplete, and you can still use it as before.\n\n**Either way, I found a simple workaround.** I reset the habit overview every\nquarter. And the added benefit is that it forces me to reconsider whether my\nhabits still serve me well. Or if I should delete or add a couple.\n\n## Additional features of Goals on Track\n\nThe core features are excellent for goal-setting. But the additional features\nmake it an even more complete tool for personal goal-setting.\n\nWe will discuss the following:\n\n  6. Task calendar and syncing\n  7. Goal templates\n  8. Vision board\n  9. Journaling feature\n  10. Document uploads\n  11. Progress report\n  12. Mobile app\n\n### #6: Task calendar and calendar syncing\n\nBesides the task overview, you can view your upcoming tasks in a calendar.\nThis provides a nice helicopter overview.\n\nYou can also drag and drop tasks on different dates.\n\nThat\u2019s great if you set too many tasks on the same day. **It enables you to\nview and easily spread out tasks to avoid overwhelm.**\n\nFinally, you can sync your calendar.\n\nThat\u2019s very useful if you use another calendar already, like Outlook or Google\nCalendar. You can also sync it with your work calendar.\n\nSimply download the iCal file and add it to any calendar.\n\n### #7: Goal templates\n\n**Goal templates allow you to save time for recurring goals.**\n\nFor example, my weekly blog post is a sub-goal of my bigger goal to publish X\narticles per year. And my sub-goal consists of several tasks, from research to\nediting and uploading.\n\nInstead of adding them manually, I created a goal template for my weekly blog\npost. Then, I assign the start date and my tasks are automatically added.\n\nPretty awesome!\n\n**You can also pick a pre-set template.** There are examples for health, home,\nmoney, personal, and work. Some of these include:\n\n  * Start my business in 6 months\n  * Write a book in 6 months\n  * Create $500 monthly passive income\n  * Lose 10 pounds in 60 days\n\nOf course, you can personalize these goals further to make them your own. But\nthese templates can form an excellent starting point.\n\n### #8: Vision board feature\n\nGoals on Track also contains a vision board section. Upload images that\nreflect how you view your life once you achieve your goals.\n\nThis section serves as an inspirational tap.\n\nYou can even run your images as a slideshow with music.\n\nPretty awesome if you want an occasional reminder of why you\u2019re pursuing your\ngoals in the first place.\n\n### #9: Journaling feature\n\nThe journaling section is a great place to reflect on your day and note\nthoughts, reminders, and ideas.\n\nYou can write journal thoughts from anywhere in the dashboard, as a prompt is\nalways at the top of your screen. This is also great for taking quick notes,\nwhich you can later expand on in the journaling section.\n\nYou can even bookmark important entries.\n\nAlthough I use different note-taking apps and prefer to journal by hand if I\ndo, it\u2019s an excellent option for those who want everything in one place.\n\n### #10: Document uploads\n\nThe idea of Goals on Track is to give you the option to have all your goal-\nrelated assets in one place.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where document uploads come into play.\n\nFor each of your goals, you can upload files that show up in your document\nsection. Alternatively, you can upload files right into this section and\nassign them to a goal.\n\nIn other words, **this area serves as a document management system for your\ngoals.** I haven\u2019t used it much yet, but I can see how this can be useful in\nsome situations.\n\n### #11: Progress report\n\nOne important aspect of goal-setting is tracking.\n\nAnd while you can track your goals individually, the progress report provides\nan additional helicopter overview.\n\nHere you can check the status of your goal, how much time you spend on each\nsection, how many habits you completed, and more.\n\nAlthough it provides some insights, this section still feels a bit clunky. And\nI would love to see more filtering options, like specific date ranges.\n\n### #12: Mobile app\n\nGoals on Track has an app for iPhone users. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no Android\noption on the market. That said, the iPhone app doesn\u2019t seem to work too well,\naccording to reviews.\n\nHowever, I do like the mobile version of the website.\n\nIf you use Chrome (and perhaps other browsers), you can save the Goals on\nTrack dashboard on your home screen. And while it still opens the webpage, it\nworks like an app.\n\n**It\u2019s fast and works well on mobile devices.  **\n\nSo that\u2019s a great way to use Goals on Track on your phone \u2013 and this is\nexactly how I often review my goals at the end of the day.\n\nThe only downside is that you need internet access. However, that shouldn\u2019t be\na problem for most people nowadays.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost planners I\u2019ve found are for organization, are TEAMS-based, and are\nexpensive.\n\n**Except forGoals on Track.**\n\n**It\u2019s the best personal goal-setting software that I\u2019ve found.** And while I\nonly started using the app this year, I\u2019m pleased with my decision.\n\n**I love its structured and organized approach.**\n\n**At the same time, it\u2019s super flexible.** You can become very creative in\nusing the tool and really make it your own.\n\nBut that also means there\u2019s a slight learning curve.\n\nI was looking for a tool that would work with the goal-setting system that I\nalready use. So, I decided to test a few small goals last December.\n\nIt took less than a month to learn the ins and outs.\n\nAfter that, I could tailor everything to my needs. That\u2019s why I now use this\napp as my only goal-setting and habit-tracking tool.\n\n**Do you want to give Goals on Track a try?**\n\nStart with a few small goals first. Then, test the different options of the\ntool to see how they work. Become inspired. And once you fully understand how\neverything works, fill up your goals.\n\n**This tool will take your goal success to the next level.**\n\nTry Goals on Track\n\nShare\n\nShare on Google Plus\n\nShare\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare\n\nShare this\n\nShare\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n#### About Mick\n\nMick is a personal growth enthusiast and was able to use it to transform his\nlife.
