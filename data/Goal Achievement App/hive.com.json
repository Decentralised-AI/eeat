heights\nin both our business and personal lives. But how do we get there? And where do\nwe start? If you are excited about staying organized and being productive but\nabsolutely overwhelmed with all the options out there, you are not alone. A\nsimple Google search will return hundreds of goal-tracking apps, many of which\nhave functionality way above and beyond what you need or may not have any\nfeatures you would find helpful.\n\nBut before you give up or decide to go with a random goal-tracking app, take a\ndeep breath and keep reading this article. You\u2019re in luck, because we\u2019ve been\nresearching too! We did the heavy lifting and are sharing our picks for the\nbest goal-tracking apps on the market to help us all stay organized, plan\ntasks ahead of time, and meet deadlines.\n\n## Choosing the Best Goal-Tracking App For You\n\nOkay, so we need to do a little brainstorming before jumping into these goal-\ntracking apps. Remember how we just mentioned that some of these apps will\nhave an insane amount of functionality? So before you choose the perfect app,\nset some parameters first. It\u2019s not like you would buy snow boots for a trip\nto the tropics, right? It\u2019s the same with this type of tracking app. You\nwouldn\u2019t want to buy an app that didn\u2019t perform in the way you hoped. So, ask\nyourself the following questions to narrow down the best goal-tracking app for\nyou:\n\n###\n\n### What will it cost?\n\nFrom a free version to a premium version, you\u2019ve got options. While there are\nsome great free options on this list, you may find yourself needing to upgrade\nto the premium version to unlock additional functionality. So keep an open\nmind, and maybe an open wallet.\n\n### What platform is it on?\n\nThe old iOS vs. Android debate may be a deal-breaker depending on what device\nyou use. While most of these apps have downloadable options on both platforms,\nthere are a few that are only available on one platform or the other, so make\nsure the one you love is on a system you use.\n\n### Does it have goal-tracking capabilities that work for you?\n\nWhile it seems silly to ask if your goal-tracking app has goal-tracking\ncapabilities, it is a legitimate question. Some of us love to have apps that\ngo off at specific times to tell us what goals we are supposed to be working\non. Others love tasks that just take up space and remind us when a goal is\ncompleted. How often you want your goal-tracking app to interact with you is a\npersonal choice.\n\n### Can you work in the software?\n\nMove on if you can\u2019t figure out the software or if it is overcomplicated.\nWasting time figuring out the complicated functionality of an app that is\nsupposed to help with productivity is both ironic and highly\ncounterproductive. Instead, settle on a user-friendly app, that has good U/X,\nand you can see yourself daily.\n\n### Does it provide you with what you need?\n\nWhat are your specific goals? Do you need this goal-tracking app to track your\npersonal life (okay, soccer practice, we\u2019re looking at you), or do you need a\ntask management platform for your work that is very robust and can be used\nwith multiple people? Determine your what, and keep that in mind as you assess\nall the critical functionality of each goal-tracking app.\n\n## The Top Goal-Tracking Apps\n\nNow that you\u2019ve mapped out your ideal budget and capabilities for a goal-\ntracking app, it\u2019s time to start looking at the tools themselves. Here\u2019s what\nyou need to know about some of the best goal-tracking apps on the market.\n\n### 1\\.

On the other hand, if you\u2019re a manager and want to track progress\ntowards your goals from a higher level, you can utilize Hive\u2019s Gantt chart\nview or Project overview module.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re setting individual or team goals, Hive can help you reach\nthem more efficiently than ever before.
