I feel that, because of this app, I can really start\n> achieving the goals I\u2019ve been wanting to achieve. This might sound gross,\n> but I\u2019ve always struggled to make sure to brush and floss my teeth twice a\n> day. Since using this app, I haven\u2019t missed it once. I\u2019ve started getting\n> back into reading by setting a daily goal of reading an hour a day. I\u2019ve\n> made sure to be working out at least 5 days a week because of this app. I\u2019ve\n> started journaling at the end of each day because of this app. I\u2019ve set\n> weight goals for myself that I\u2019m tracking, and it even gives a projection\n> for my weight by my goal date based on how much progress I\u2019m making so far.\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> The app is basically just a daily to-do list, and that may sound super\n> simple, but it\u2019s so powerful. I feel accomplished completing my goals each\n> day, and the app encourages me to stick with it and achieve more. Thanks to\n> Strides, I\u2019m able to form the habits I\u2019ve been wanting to form, and break my\n> goals up into pieces each day, which makes them much easier to achieve.

It has been pivotal in tracking my progress\n> and staying on top of my goals. My only issue and something I think should\n> be changed is the tagging and archive features. I love the tagging feature\n> to organize my goals.. BUT I track daily goals tagged by their month/year\n> and I also track my annual goals tagged as annual/year. BUT in my due today\n> tab the daily goals that have a goal date that is in the past they still\n> appear in the due today tab. First problem, the due today tab should only\n> show you the items that are within the set period of time for the specific\n> goal. For example, I have a goal that is a target number to hit for the\n> period of January 1 -31. On February 1, that same goal was still showing up\n> as due today.\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> Second issue, to try to fix the first issue I decided to archive the goals\n> that have \u201cexpired\u201d, which seems to alleviate this because they no longer\n> appear in my due today tab. BUT when I click the drop down to sort by tags,\n> my January 2020 tag is now empty because I archived those goals. So, it\n> should be possible to archive any and all goals but still be able to sort by\n> their other tags.\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> Would love to see a solution to this issue, whether it\u2019s the one I described\n> or another one. Thanks! Still absolutely love the app, just a few minor\n> suggestions for optimization.\n>\n> more\n\n###  Developer Response  ,\n\n> Thanks for reaching out! I'm really glad to hear you're enjoying Strides,\n> and I appreciate the feedback. I\u2019d be happy to help with tagging and\n> archiving. Please reach out through the Feedback view in the app so I can\n> help out.\n>\n>  \n>\n>\n> Best of luck with all your goals & habits!\n>\n> Kyle Richey\n>\n> Strides CEO\n>\n> more\n\nKarrots125  ,  12/01/2017\n\n###  Sleek, Simple Strides\n\n> So I downloaded several different apps of this type of goal-tracker app. I\n> was able to quickly narrow it down to this and one other by virtue of how\n> easy it is to add custom goals and track them. Over the coarse of a month\n> this one has become by far my favorite. It allows me to customize what, how\n> many, how often,and track with an easy swipe left or right. It gives me\n> reminders but doesn't annoy me. I can easily go back to log days I've done\n> (or not) but haven't logged and I can see at a glance whether I'm improving\n> the frequency of my goals. This has quickly become one of my most frequently\n> used apps! Highly recommend for all ages of goal-setters and (hopefully)\n> accompish-ers!\n>\n> Update: I\u2019ve been using this for about six months now and still think this\n> is by far the best goal-tracker app. I love the personalized goals and being\n> able to look back over the months and see how I\u2019m improving long-term. I\u2019m\n> slowly adding goals and know this app is what is keeping me focused!\n>\n> more\n\n##  Events\n\n###  NOW AVAILABLE\n\nMAJOR UPDATE\n\nBig Goal Small Steps\n\n##  App Privacy\n\nSee Details\n\nThe developer, Goals LLC, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may\ninclude handling of data as described below.
