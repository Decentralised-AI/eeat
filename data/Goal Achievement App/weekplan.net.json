Often, it takes time to manage or\nremember multiple things at once. Add the constant on-the-go lifestyle, and\nthings get even more complicated. For example, having paper-based journals or\nplanners is almost impossible. However, an intelligent goal-setting app on our\nsmartphones is the solution.\n\nMobile phones and tablets have built-in planner apps that let users set their\nreminders and tasks. However, they have limited features which do not work\nwell for people who want efficient goal-setting solutions. To solve their\nproblem, we present a list of the top goal-setting apps you can use to set,\ntrack, and fulfill your goals.\n\n## 1\\. Week Plan\n\nWeek Plan is one of the best goal-setting apps around. Week Plan stands out\nbecause it offers tailored planners for various purposes. Each of these\nplanners focuses on exclusive needs and promises to deliver desired results.\n\nThe goal-setting app by Week Plan has gained popularity in a short time\nbecause of its valuable features and ease of use.

Setting SMART Goals\n\nWe are all aware of the significance of SMART goals in setting and achieving\nour plans. SMART is the acronym for specific, measurable, achievable,\nrelevant, and time-bound. A goal will be fulfilled when it is set by keeping\nthese aspects in mind. Whether they are business goals or personal ones, being\nSMART is the key to success.\n\nWeek Plan is a unique goal-setting application that facilitates users in\nsetting goals they can achieve. It incorporates the SMART framework in its\napplication. This means users are default setting their goals by the most\nefficient model.\n\nNot only this, Week Plan lets users break their goals into smaller milestones.\nSome countless articles and blogs highlight the importance and benefits of\ndividing goals into smaller ones. Week Plan implements these benefits into\naction without compromising on the SMART goals.\n\n#### 2\\. Journaling\n\nMaking journal entries and jotting down notes with tasks or reminders is a\nsignificant aspect of setting goals. Writing notes help us add minute details\nto our goals, how we wish to achieve them, and other details. Especially those\nwho understand the therapeutic benefits of journaling can understand the\nimmense help journaling brings in accomplishing our objectives.\n\nThe goal tracker app by Week Plan has done us all a great favor by adding the\njournaling feature to its mobile app. It lets users set goals, stay connected\nto their progress, and even express their feelings through journal entries.\nThe goal journal is easy to use and can be accessed anytime. It connects to\nthe goals so users can review their entries associated with a particular task.\n\nResearchers deduce a direct link between journaling and goal achievement.\nScientific studies have found that writing about business or personal goals\nprovides a perspective and helps complete set targets. Week Plan puts these\nstudies into practice and does immense favor to all users.\n\n#### 3\\. High-Impact Tasks\n\nOur goals and objectives are comprised of several actions. Each action brings\nus a step closer to our target. However, some actions hold more value than\nothers. Additionally, some tasks are more important than others, and\ncompleting them has a greater impact on our overall achievement score.\n\nWeek Plan is a great goal-setting application designed with a keen observation\nof human behaviors and a special focus on ways of enhancing efficiency. It\nallows users to add high-impact tasks and complete them before the rest. By\nprioritizing these tasks, users experience relief from getting closer to\ncompleting their goals.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Users can set quarterly goals\n  * Focus on high-impact tasks\n  * Very easy to use\n  * Simple layout\n  * Allows users to take notes or make entries on goals and tasks\n\n### Cons\n\n  * Too simple\n  * Some users find the layout too plain\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n  * Windows\n  * macOS\n  * Android\n  * iOS\n\n### Pricing\n\n  * Free 7-day trial\n  * Monthly subscription of $10.83\n  * Yearly package for $104\n\n### Customer support\n\n  * FAQs\n  * Knowledge base\n  * Forums\n  * Chat\n  * Email\n  * Phone support\n\n### Ratings\n\nWeek Plan is rated 4.5 on Capterra and 4.3 on G2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWeek Plan is the most advantageous goal-setting app around. It checks all\nboxes of technology and utility tool designed with special consideration for\nhuman behaviors and thinking patterns. One might just think productivity\npsychologists have developed it.\n\nWeek Plan\u2019s goal-setting app is packed with useful features such as SMART\ngoal-setting and task prioritization, which works perfectly for individuals\nand business goals. It is available on all devices, giving users instant\naccess to their goals and tasks wherever they are.\n\nWeek Plan\u2019s mobile app is simple and easy to use. Its to-the-point layout\nfocuses on your goals, not unnecessary bells and whistles.\n\n## 2\\. ClickUp\n\nClickUp is one of the most famous and frequently used goal-setting apps. This\ngoal-tracking app lets users focus on their daily goals, and lets teams stay\nin sync with their targets and tasks.\n\nWhat makes ClickUp a preference is its interactive features and multiple\noptions for setting goals and determining goal types. Its free version is also\na significant attraction for single users. Users can take benefit of its\nfeatures without paying any monthly subscription or annual fee. However,\ndepending on their size, it offers paid plans for teams and businesses.\n\n### Features\n\n  * Goal timelines\n  * Progress tracking\n  * Multiple target types\n  * Objective key results (OKR)\n  * Goal folders\n  * Shareable goals\n  * Add teams\n\n### Top 3 Features\n\n  1. Objective Key Results\n\nObjective Key Results, or OKRs, are an effective way to set and complete\ngoals. The OKR framework focuses on having objectives and measuring their\nresults using key metrics or KPIs. This method especially benefits large\norganizations with business goals based on numbers or other performance\nmetrics.\n\nClickUp includes the OKR framework for setting goals in its goal tracker app.\nThis lets teams and businesses get goals with key performance indicators to\nanalyze progress in the right direction.\n\n2\\. Multiple Target Types\n\nDifferent types of goals have different criteria to measure their progress or\ncompleteness. Some tasks involve sub-tasks, while others require entering\nstart and end numbers to determine progress. Others involve simply marking\nwork as done or not done. However, most goal-setting applications lack the\ndiversity to cater to varying goal types.\n\nClickUp caters to this concerns and includes helpful task target parameters\nwhich users can use to mark their work as done. These trackers include tasks\nand subtasks, numbers, money targets, and true or false trackers.\n\nWith different ways of marking goals as complete, users get more freedom to\nset different goals and effectively measure their progress in a number of\nways.\n\n3\\. Shareable Goals\n\nThis feature is particularly helpful for teams working in a remote setup. All\nteam members must stay updated with company goals and tasks that lead to it.\nEach member is delegated some tasks or responsibilities and all other members\nof the team must be updated on progress.\n\nThe best way to ensure seamless workflow is by creating shareable goals which\nevery member can view, comment, and update on. ClickUp introduces the\nshareable goals feature to ensure smooth work operations across all\ndepartments and provide maximum team participation.\n\nClickUp users can get goals and authorize multiple users to access them.\nAdditionally, it allows creating multiple leaders who can acces and modify the\ngoals and their associated tasks. Other team members can update their progress\nand view goals.\n\nThis system defines a hierarchy in work and related decisions which ensure\nefficient work completion. By defining team leaders and members, workplaces\ncan enhance their productivity and create organized workflow.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Different targets according to goals\n  * View and access for team members\n  * Progress tracking\n  * Intuitive interface\n  * Easy migration from other apps\n\n### Cons\n\n  * Unnecessary reminders\n  * Problems in android app\n  * Confusing features and layout\n  * Multiple features sometimes become too complicated for users\n  * Issues in app loading during simultaneous work\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n  * Windows\n  * macOS\n  * Android\n  * iOS\n\n### Pricing\n\n  * Unlimited, for small teams, at $9 per member\n  * Business, for mid-sized teams, at $19 per member\n  * Business Plus, for multiple teams, at $29 per member\n  * Enterprise, for large teams.\n  * Yearly packages \n    * Unlimited, for small teams, at $5 per member per month\n    * Business, for mid-sized teams, at $12 per member per month\n    * Business Plus, for multiple teams, at $19 per member per month\n    * Enterprise, for large teams.\n\n### Customer support\n\n  * Forums\n  * FAQs\n  * Email\n  * Chat\n  * Knowledge base\n  * Phone support\n\n### Ratings\n\nClickUp rates 4.7 on Capterra, G2, and GetApp. GetApp gives this goal-setting\napp 4.6 for value for money and functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nClickUp has gained a handsome reputation among users as a handy goal-setting\napp. It offers maximum functionality to facilitate the creation of manageable\ntasks and set different ways of measuring progress over time.\n\nHowever, users complain about its complex layout and issues with app loading,\nwhich is attributed to all the extra features added to the mobile app.\nAlthough they have their utility, too many features make the application\nchallenging and confusing to grasp.\n\n## 3\\. Strides\n\nAmong the list of top goal-setting and habit-tracking apps is Strides, and for\na good reason. This simple yet efficient habit tracker lets users create and\nachieve personal goals in no time.\n\nStrides makes use of the SMART framework to set goals. It also enables users\nto eliminate bad habits and adopt good ones for a better lifestyle. It is\navailable on Apple devices, including the Apple Watch, so users are connected\nwith their goals anywhere and anytime.\n\n### Features\n\n  * Goals tracking\n  * Habits tracker\n  * Multiple tracker types\n  * Habit reports\n  * SMART goals\n  * Daily goals\n  * Habit streaks\n\n### Top 3 Features\n\n  1. Different Tracker Types\n\nStrides offers multiple ways of tracking progress. It has the option of\nswiping for yes or no, which is best for tracking habits. Selecting a yes or\nno option is suitable for adopting or eliminating certain habits. The flexible\nreminders ensure constant checks, and follow-ups do not get on your nerves.\n\nFor example, users can swipe for \u201cyes\u201d if they have exercised that day.\nSimilarly, they can select \u201cno\u201d for not smoking on a particular day. Thus,\nthey can stay updated with their good or bad habits by adopting simple\ntracking methods.\n\nThe target-based method works for exponential progress-based tasks. Users can\nenter their start and end progress and use numerical values to measure\nprogress. This method best suits entrepreneurs and business owners wishing to\ntrack their monetary progress and analyze business growth.\n\nThe other two methods of tracking progress are average-based and project-\nbased. Both are helpful with gaols that are measured over time and updated\ndaily. Habits such as sleep routines are tracked as averages to see the\naverage sleep time. Projects are completed by milestones. Thus the percentage\nmethod works best for them.\n\n2\\. Daily Routines\n\nWe add different goals due on different days. Some goals and tasks are\nrecurring, thus requiring daily reminders. The daily routines feature allows\nusers to focus on tasks for the present day instead of worrying over all tasks\nsimultaneously.\n\nFocusing on tasks due on a particular day is a great way to relieve stress and\npromote the \u201clive for today\u201d mantra. It helps users focus on current work and\ntake baby steps towards completing big goals.\n\nAlso, Strides evokes a sense of achievement by awarding users the \u201cperfect\nday\u201d badge when they complete all tasks lined up for the day and move them to\nthe \u201cdone\u201d section. If users forget to mark tasks, they can always return to\nprevious dates and mark them as done. Thus, for Strides users, passed time is\nnot lost, it can always be reclaimed.\n\n3\\. Progress Reports\n\nAnother stunning feature in the Strides app is the layout of the progress\nreports. One might expect the reports to follow a unified layout with the same\nunits representing all data. However, Strides is a pleasant surprise with its\nunique progress report format, where every task or goal progress is measured\nin its exclusive unit.\n\nThis means that a single progress layout displays weight goals as kilograms,\njogging as kilometers, profits as percentages, and sleep as average hours, all\nin the same display. Users no longer have to swap between screens or goals to\nsee progress.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Different tracker types\n  * Updated habit trackers\n  * Daily goals\n  * Sync with Apple Watch\n\n### Cons\n\n  * Not available on desktop or android devices\n  * Not suitable for teams\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n  * macOS\n  * iOS\n\n### Pricing\n\n  * Free version\n  * Paid plans from $4.99 per user per month\n\n### Customer support\n\n  * FAQs\n\n### Ratings\n\nThere are no ratings for this application.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStrides is a focused goal and habit tracker that promises straightforward\nprogress and uninterrupted goal completion. It offers different ways of\nmeasuring progress for various goals to offer a seamless experience.\n\nHowever, this goal-setting app lags behind in several aspects, so it fails to\nmake an impression. The mobile app is unavailable for android devices and\nwindows operating systems, thereby badly limiting its accessibility. Strides\nis also more of a personal habit tracker app than a business goal-setting\ntool.\n\n## 4\\. Weekdone\n\nWeekdone is another goal-setting app that offers an intuitive interface that\noffers a feature-packed experience to teams and individuals. It promises\nproductivity through some benchmark frameworks such as OKRs and KPIs.\n\nWeedone\u2019s features focus mainly on the goal-setting needs of teams and\nbusinesses. However, it is practical for personal use as well. Weekdone uses\nthe OKR framework that lets users create goals and measure them through\ntangible metrics. It provides better results and enhances productivity for\nbusinesses and people in general.\n\n### Features\n\n  * Goals tracking\n  * OKRs\n  * Weekly progress\n  * KPIs\n  * Color coded progress\n  * Tv dashboards\n  * Team connections\n  * Automated reports\n  * Connection with apps\n\n### Top 3 Features\n\n  1.

Users\ncan see goals in the hierarchy and tree view and quickly view all progress in\nthe overview section.\n\nThe hierarchy view shows goals in a complete hierarchy. The top displays the\ngoals set for the entire company. It is followed by goals set for team members\nbased on their roles and position within the company. All members are well\naware of the responsibilities delegated to everyone based on their roles.\n\nThe tree view presents goals at a glance to provide a more holistic view. This\nview presents more information on the tasks instead of the people they are\nassigned to. However, users can see assignees with their name initials.\n\nFinally, the overview is a precise yet comprehensive view of all goals and\nprogress. The interactive display in lines and numbers gives an instant\ninsight into the progress toward set goals.\n\n3\\. Automatic Reports\n\nAutomatic reports are an easy and quick way to analyze company progress. These\nprogress reports are emailed to all team members so they can stay updated with\ntheir goals and achievements.\n\nThese reports are most helpful because they present complete information about\nall goals from different views. Additionally, the Tv dashboard allows users to\nsee the big picture of their big picture.\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Different views\n  * Team view\n  * Notifications to alert team members\n  * Feedback in progress\n\n### Cons\n\n  * Slow app performance\n  * Poor user interface\n  * Lack of swift customer support\n  * Time-consuming to set OKRs\n  * Finding OKRs can be tricky at times\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n  * Windows\n  * macOS\n  * Android\n  * iOS\n\n### Pricing\n\n  * Free for up to 3 users\n  * 14-day trial for four or more users\n  * Monthly package according to team members\n  * Yearly package according to team members\n\n### Customer support\n\n  * Email\n  * Help desk\n  * FAQs\n  * Forums\n  * Chat\n  * Knowledge base\n\n### Ratings\n\nCapterra and GetApp rate Weekdone at 4.5. GetApp gives Weekdone a rating of\n4.5 and 4.1 for pricing and functionality, respectively. G2 has rated this\ngoal tracker app at 4.1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWeekdone is a goal-setting and tracking application accessible to all users\nacross multiple devices. This application focuses on teamwork and features\nrelevant goal-setting and progress summaries.\n\nSome users complain about Weekdone\u2019s complex interface and lagging mobile app.\nThis is a common issue that arises with applications where developers tend to\noverdo the features. Therefore, it is best to opt for apps that are simple and\nstraightforward to avoid lags and performance issues.\n\n## 5\\. GoalsOnTrack\n\nThe last goal-setting app on our list is GoalsOnTrack.
