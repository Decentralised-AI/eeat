It\u2019s what we do\n> consistently.\u201d_ \u2014 Tony Robbins\n\nWe all set goals \u2014 both business and personal. Goals may differ in complexity,\nsize, or due dates. However, they have one thing in common \u2014 if we don\u2019t keep\ntrack of our goals, they are doomed to fail eventually.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s not enough to just set a goal and sit tight \u2014 setting a goal\nis only half the job. To make progress toward achieving them, one must\ncarefully **keep track of their goals\u2019 progress.**  \n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\n  * How can we keep track of goals effectively?\n  * Who can use goal tracker tools?\n  * The best goal tracking apps you can use\n  * 1\\.

Lifetick \u2014 makes your dreams come true\n  * What is the takeaway?\n\n## How can we keep track of goals effectively?\n\nWhile simple pen and paper may work for some \u2014 the majority of people would\nstill opt for a computer-based tracking system or a smartphone app.\n\nAs a matter of fact, according to a two-year study among 811 people with\nweight problems, the utilization of the computerized tracking system helped\nthem achieve their ultimate goal \u2014 losing excess weight.\n\nThe participants used different tracking software to record food intake and\nphysical activity.

I bafflingly answered: _\u201cI have no idea.\u201d_ Then, she told me I\nshould start using a pedometer app to keep track of my fitness goals.\n\nInspired by my mom, I did some research \u2014 how many people track their steps,\ni.e. their health goals?\n\nInterestingly, millennials are not the only ones who utilize different goal\ntracking apps day-to-day, according to Statista. Yes, people aged 30\u201339 (41%)\nare among the most frequent users of apps related to health tracking. But, a\nwhopping 25% of people aged 50\u201359 and 21% of people aged over 60 reported\nusing some goal tracker app to track their fitness goals.\n\nAnyone can benefit from goal-tracking tools \u2014 since most of them are quite\neasy to use and customize.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we\u2019ll talk about the most prominent goal-tracking\napps currently available on the market. These apps can help you track progress\ntoward achieving your goals.\n\n## The best goal tracking apps you can use\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s difficult to find a goal tracking app that covers everything\nwe need.\n\nSo much time is spent looking for a good app that we often grow tired of\ntesting them out and just give up. Then our goals get a setback for a while,\nuntil we\u2019re motivated again to research the app stores.\n\nOnly to be disappointed again or settle for a sub-par app that we give up on a\nfew days later.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth \u2014 we don\u2019t know ourselves that good.\n\nBecause, depending on our type of goal-setter and goal-getter, some apps will\nwork while others won\u2019t.\n\nThat is why we decided to test out apps that play on different kinds of\nmotivations.\n\nGoing through the list, you\u2019ll better understand what type of person you are\nand which goal tracking app will suit you the most.\n\nIn short, whether aimed at personal, fitness, or business goals \u2014 these are\nthe best goal tracker apps in our experience:\n\n  1.
