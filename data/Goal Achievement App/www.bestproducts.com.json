While these\nmake the practice of goal-setting and -keeping more convenient, it's a good\nidea to think about what exactly you're trying to accomplish with this form of\ndigital daily tracking.\n\nAccording to clinical psychologist and author Dr. Paula Durlofsky, \u201cSetting\ngoals takes conscious planning and implementing the necessary smaller steps.\u201d\nGoals like running a marathon, writing a novel, or getting a degree aren\u2019t the\ntypes of things you can realistically check off on an app, so you'll want to\nfind a way to work toward these goals by breaking them down into smaller, more\ndoable, daily tasks.\n\nBut what if you fall off track? As anyone who's ever made a New Year's\nresolution knows, keeping good habits every day is easier said than done.\n\n\u201cA common mistake people make when making healthy and positive changes in\none\u2019s life is the belief that if they don\u2019t stick to their new behaviors 100%\nof the time, they lose the hope that they can change ... But, in reality, this\ntype of thinking, which psychologists refer to as a cognitive distortion known\nas \u2018black and white thinking\u2019 or \u2018all or none thinking\u2019 undermines the fact\nthat everyone makes mistakes or that we all, at times, drift off course.\u201d\n\nDurlofsky advises that people approach these types of digital trackers with an\nattitude of self-compassion. Think of them as providing gentle accountability.\n\n### How We Chose\n\nTo find these 11 best goal-setting apps, we searched the top of the\nProductivity charts of the Apple and Google Play app stores, considering goal-\ntracking apps with thousands of user reviews, and we downloaded the free\nversion onto our Apple device where applicable.\n\nThese multifaceted, user-favorite apps are all easy to learn and navigate,\ncustomizable (to a certain extent), upbeat and motivating, and they offer push\nnotifications and various weekly and monthly views for you to keep tabs on\nyour progress. Keep in mind that nearly all of these goal-tracking apps are\nfree to download but have a premium version that unlocks full app\nfunctionality.\n\nDONE\n\n1\n\n## DONE\n\n _Free, or $39.99/year_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nThe DONE app neatly combines goal- and habit-tracking into one cleanly\ndesigned place. Users can set \u201cbuild habits\u201d or \u201cquit habits\u201d to encourage\nthem to meet or stay beneath a designated number per day, week, or month.\n\nEvery completed habit allows users to continue their success streak, which is\nmeant to encourage them to keep going. The app also provides weekly, monthly,\nand yearly summaries, so that they can see their peaks and valleys over any\nlength of time. Plus, this data can even be exported to a CSV file.\n\nWe really like this app's custom color display and its easy-to-edit multiple\nreminders \u2014 it also offers passcode protection. Just keep in mind that the\nfree version offers very limited habit-tracking (just three habits), while the\npaid subscription is unlimited.\n\n**More:** Our Favorite Stress-Busting Products That Help Calm Us Down\n\nAloe Bud\n\n2\n\n## Aloe Bud\n\n _Free, or $4.99 for a lifetime subscription_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nAloe Bud is a habit-tracking app with a focus on self-care, and it looks like\nit was engineered to be Gen Z catnip with its cute, calming, 8-bit graphics.\nIts positive reviews also caught our eye, with users saying \"It's absolutely\nbeautiful\" and \"The reminders are very gentle and motivational.\"\n\nThe app is unique from others on this list, as it only provides 11 different\ncategories of tracking (like move, breathe, hydrate, and rest) and gives users\nthe choice to check off a habit on a particular schedule or pause to reflect\nwith a short prompt. These activities aren\u2019t able to be customized but are\ngeneral enough to apply to most people. The paid subscription allows users to\ncustomize the messaging a bit more.\n\nWhile limited, it is a nice digital respite from the other apps on our phone\nthat tend to make us more anxious than calm.\n\nStrides\n\n3\n\n## Strides\n\n _Free, or $4.99/month, $29.99/year, $79.99/lifetime access_\n\n ****DOWNLOAD NOW  \n\nWhat's the difference between a non-starter goal and a SMART one? SMART goals\nfeel less amorphous, because they're Specific, Measurable, Achievable,\nRelevant, and Timely, and this app uses these same categories to set you up\nfor success.  \n\nOn Strides, you can set daily habits that are relevant to achieving any goal\nyou have in mind, by any deadline. Each day, you hold yourself accountable to\nthese goals by checking off the habits on your checklist.\n\nEach successful daily habit will be highlighted in green, while skipped habits\nare red to incentivize you to not break your stride.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nForest\n\n4\n\n## Forest: Stay Focused\n\n _$1.99 for lifetime access_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW  \n\nThere are lots of Pomodoro-style timer apps out there to help you get work\ndone uninterrupted, but the Forest app is one of the most unique ones we've\nfound. We like this distraction-busting app's cute, gamified approach.\n\nStart by opening the app and selecting your timer length \u2014 you can choose\nbetween 10 minutes and 2 hours. Once you begin your timer, a seed is planted\nand will start to grow for as long as the timer is running. But if you exit\nout of the app to answer texts or scroll around on social media, your tree\nwill die! This app can also sync up with its desktop Chrome Extension, so you\ncan't cheat.\n\nIf you can successfully keep your tree growing until your time's up, you can\ncollect coins. The coins are a great bonus because you can either use them to\ngrow different types of trees (we told you this app was cute), or you can use\nup to 2,500 of your accumulated coins to help plant a real tree through the\napp's partner, the nonprofit organization, Trees for the Future.\n\nWay of Life\n\n5\n\n## Way of Life\n\n _Free, or $7.99 for lifetime access_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW  \n\nThis top-rated habit-tracker app also takes a daily checklist approach, and it\nlayers in some note-taking functionality as well, if you\u2019d like to give\ncontext as to why you didn\u2019t meet a certain goal for the day. The longer you\nkeep using it, the more useful it\u2019ll be, as you can zoom out on your week,\nquarter, or year, to see how much progress you\u2019ve made.\n\nEven though this app uses a chain approach as a visible encouragement to keep\nup with your daily and weekly goals, we like that it doesn't feel like you're\nstarting from square one if you happen to miss a day.  \n\nFabulous\n\n6\n\n## Fabulous\n\n _Free, or $35.99/year_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nFabulous is a great app for those who want to fine-tune their daily routines\nto experience happier mornings and more productive workdays.\n\nThe app has a science-based approach, where all of its pre-planned sessions\nare created in collaboration with experts or are based on data supporting\nstress-reduction techniques and positive psychology.\n\nNot only can Fabulous users track daily goals but the premium version of this\napp integrates various programs for dieting, fitness, and mindfulness\nexercises. Its eye-catching graphics help make the journey a little more\naesthetically pleasing as well.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nHabit-Bull\n\n7\n\n## HabitBull\n\n _Free, or $5.00 for lifetime access_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nThe HabitBull app has a clean, colorful interface that'll actually make you\nwant to open it up again and again. Each day presents a fresh color-coded\nchecklist of chosen habits that users can either check yes/no or enter a\nnumber to denote whether or not a goal was met. Users can look back on their\nweeks and months to keep track of anything from flossing to hours of sleep to\nfitness to making Zoom dates with friends.  \n\nWe like that it offers tons of flexibility for your own goal-setting style,\nwhether you want to chart your daily tasks in streaks or just punch in your\nprogress periodically.\n\nHabitBull's push notifications can also be enabled to remind goal-setters when\nto do things or even just nudge you to open the app and check in on where\nyou're at that day. The free version of this goal-tracking app allows you to\ntrack five habits at a time, but the premium version lets you track up to 100.\n\nLoop Habit Tracker\n\n8\n\n## Loop Habit Tracker\n\n _Free_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nHow satisfying does it feel to check something off of your to-do list? With\nLoop's goal-tracking app, the more good habits you set for yourself, the more\nyou'll _want_ to do them.\n\nThis free, open-source Android app is touted by users for its simple design\nand intuitive setup, and there are no annoying pop-ups or advertisements\nanywhere on the screen. Just check each task off as you do it to complete the\n\u201cloop\u201d that\u2019s next to each of your goals.\n\nThis app displays progress in both a checklist and a chart setup, so you can\nsee your daily frequency, as well as your month-over-month progress. You can\nalso choose whether to set notifications at specific times to give you that\npush in the right direction.\n\nStreaks\n\n9\n\n## Streaks\n\n _$4.99 for lifetime access_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nWhile some of these apps let you track tons of habits at once, Streaks puts an\nemphasis on your most vital dozen. It's focused on daily and weekly habit-\ntracking (rather than occasional activities), so it's ideal for those who want\nto take active steps to quit smoking, burn calories, practice an instrument,\nor learn a new language. ****\n\nReviewers love this paid app for its attractive and highly customizable user\ninterface (you can change the color scheme, button icons, and even the app's\nicon on your home screen). Plus, it's completely integrated with the iOS\nHealth app, so all of your health- and fitness-related progress transfers\nright over for easy access and analysis.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nProductive\n\n10\n\n## Productive\n\n _Free, or $6.99/month, $29.99/year_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nProductive is another iPhone-only app that prioritizes habit streaks over\nsporadic goal-tracking. Under each goal in the dashboard, it lists how many\ndays you've reached in your streak (based on the parameters that you've set),\nmotivating you to keep your numbers up.\n\nThe free version starts beginners off with just five goals, the ability to set\ntime-of-day reminders, and some generalized streak statistics, which may be\nmore than enough for you!\n\nHowever, if you're a total data-head, the paid version is very much worth the\ninvestment, as you can dig into each goal and track week-over-week progress.\nIt also unlocks unlimited tracking, enhanced privacy settings, and more\ngranular habit stats.\n\nTrello\n\n11\n\n## Trello\n\n _Free_\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nFor those who have more of a project-manager mindset, Trello is a great app\nthat keeps all of your to-dos (as well as your team\u2019s or family\u2019s) in one\nconvenient place that\u2019s accessible from your device or desktop.  \n\nReviewers like using it not only for work tasks but for keeping an ongoing\nlist of personal habits on the agenda at all times. You can set recurring\nreminders, color-code types of tasks, and schedule future events to set you up\nfor success. It's also quite handy if you alternate between a desktop and a\ndevice throughout the day.\n\nAs a collaborative tool, Trello also allows you to delegate responsibilities\nand check out in real time which tasks need to get done, whether you're\nplanning a road trip, a home project, or coordinating tasks with a remote-\nbased team.\n\nThe free version is great for individuals who just want its organizational\nfunctionality \u2014 you can create 10 boards with unlimited cards and lists within\nit. The paid versions are better-suited for multiuser business teams.\n\nMelanie Yates\n\nSenior Service Editor\n\nMelanie Yates is the senior service editor of Best Products, where she writes\nand reports pieces pertaining to the etiquette, dilemmas, and how-tos of gift-\ngiving for different occasions.
