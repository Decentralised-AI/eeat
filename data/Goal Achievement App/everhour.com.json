Our\nprimary focus is to maintain the trust our readers place in our impartial and\nauthentic app assessments, aimed at elevating productivity and goal attainment\nacross diverse settings.\n\n## Why Do You Need a Goal Tracking App?\n\nBefore we list some of the best goal app apps, we need to talk about why you\nmight want a goal-tracking app in the first place. After all, these apps\naren\u2019t going to minimize the tasks you need to do in order to achieve the\ngoals that you\u2019ve set yourself, so how would they increase your productivity?\n\nWhen you use a goal-tracking app, you and your team can:\n\n  * Neatly organize the goals you need to achieve\n  * Prioritize your goals in terms of importance\n  * Coordinate who needs to do what and by what date\n  * Easily keep track of progress to ensure no deadline is missed\n  * Access every detail to do with the goal at any time from anywhere in the world\n\nWith that being said, not every goal-tracking app is good. So, to help you\nfind the best app for tracking goals that also suits your needs, in the\nsection below, we will show you 12 of our favorites, giving each one an\noverview, how to use it to keep track of your goals, and the pros and cons of\neach of the different apps.\n\n## Who Can Benefit from Goal-Setting Apps?\n\nJust about anyone can benefit from using the best goal tracking apps. When you\nhave clearly set your goals in an app, you can always go back and check what\nyou need to accomplish and when you need to accomplish it by. That way, no\ngoals of yours will get left behind or forgotten about.\n\nBesides, goal-setting apps aren\u2019t just for helping you with achieving your\npersonal goals. They can also be used by managers and team leaders to keep\nthem and their team at work on the track with what goals need to be achieved\nprofessionally within the firm.\n\nThat said, keep in mind that these apps aren\u2019t a magic wand. While they may\nmake it easier for you to prioritize your goals and help you achieve them,\nthey won\u2019t achieve the goal for you. You still need to take out the time and\nput in the effort to achieve your goals.\n\n## The 12 Best Goal Tracking Apps Available Today\n\n### Everhour\n\nEverhour is a popular time tracker and one of the best goal-setting apps on\nthe market today. You can either set nice and simple goals that you can keep\ntrack of, or you can use the app to its full potential and use it for bigger\nand more complex goals.\n\nEverhour can be used for anything from time tracking using the time clock app\nand as an attendance tracker to streamlining processes, keeping track of\nbudgets, or even integrating Everhour with other applications such as ClickUp\nor Notion.\n\nOne of the biggest issues people face with goal-tracking apps is their\ninterface and difficulty of use. That\u2019s not the case with Everhour. As soon as\nyou log into your dashboard, navigating through the app and setting your goals\nin place is super easy.\n\nIn terms of downsides, the only real drawback with Everhour is that it doesn\u2019t\nhave an offline option, meaning you can\u2019t time track or access the app and\nyour data without a connection to the internet.\n\nSet up goals and achieve them!\n\nWith Everhour, you can set estimates, track your time  \non tasks, and watch your progress in real-time!  \nPretty simple!\n\nExplore\n\n### Evernote\n\nWith Evernote, you can make a bullet-style journal, in a very similar way to\nApple Notes, which we will cover later. The reason this app is so popular is\nthat it allows you to lay out all of your goals in a very clear and concise\nmanner, making it much easier to approach and tick off each goal you achieve.\n\nThat said, bullet journaling can take a lot of time and effort. And if you\naren\u2019t one who\u2019s good at arts and crafts, it might not be for you. But with\nEvernote, you can create really good-looking bullet journal entries that you\ncan view digitally.\n\nThat way, you can access the journal at any time you want. And since you add\naesthetic features digitally, there are endless possibilities with how you set\nand view your goals with the app.\n\nAnd while this is primarily a journaling app, it also has a daily to-do list\nfeature. So, if you\u2019re short on time, you can always refer to the to-do list\nto check on what you have to accomplish during the day, week, month, or a\nspecific time frame.\n\nThe great thing about Evernote is that you can use it completely for free, but\nif you want to take advantage of all its features, you\u2019ll have to pay a\nmonthly subscription. Still, it\u2019s just around $7 per month for an individual\nand around $13 for teams.\n\n### ClickUp\n\nClickUp is another modern, intuitive, and really useful goal-tracking\napplication. It can be used by an individual or a large group of people and\nhelp effectively keep track of goals no matter how big or small.\n\nClickUp is very similar to Trello, with the exception that it has a much\nbetter UI. You can still add comments, attachments, or additional information\nwithin each card, you can set deadlines, assign people to each task and even\nget reminders every time a task goes through the pipeline or is overdue.\nThanks to all those features, you can easily prioritize and keep track of\nprogress before shifting your attention down the list.\n\nThe main advantages of ClickUp are that it\u2019s a free goal tracker app (for the\nmost part), is very easy to navigate, and no matter how many goals you want to\ntrack, it\u2019s easy to keep everything neatly organized.\n\nThe one downside of using ClickUp is that it\u2019s quite awkward to navigate on\nmobile and will need some getting used to.\n\n### Strides\n\nThe reason we chose to feature Strides on this list is that it can be used as\na goal-tracking app. With Strides, you can put a high emphasis on setting\ngoals using SMART criteria, which allows you to easily approach complex and\ndifficult goals by breaking them down into easily achievable tasks.\n\nWith the SMART goals set up in Strides, you and your team can set attainable\ngoals that push towards a larger objective. This makes achieving big tasks\nmuch easier.\n\nOn top of that, Strides makes it easy to track your progress. The goals that\nare in green are the ones on which you are on track, while the ones in red are\nthe ones that you\u2019re behind on. You can even set reminders, deadlines, and\nmore to give you even more control over your daily goals.\n\nThat said, you have to pay if you want to track more than three goals on\nStrides. While the service is definitely worth the money, this isn\u2019t the best\nif you\u2019re looking to spend $0 on a goal-tracking app.\n\n### Weekdone\n\nWeekdone is a fantastic weekly and daily goal app for larger teams. It\u2019s one\nof the only options on the market with good OKR features. This allows you to\nset more challenging and ambitious goals for the team or organization, while\nstill getting measurable results.\n\nOn top of that, this goal app comes with features to boost employee morale.\nFor example, there are one-on-ones and weekly check-inf features that allow\nyou to communicate with the team and ensure that everyone is well and on track\nwith their performance.\n\nBesides, Weekdone is one of the few apps that are great for tracking both long\nand short-term goals. It also allows you to prioritize all your different\ngoals very clearly so that you and your team know exactly where the company is\nat.\n\nWith that being said, the only downside to Weekdone is that if you have a team\nlarger than three members, you\u2019ll need to sign up for the premium plan, which\ncosts more the more people you add.\n\n### nTask\n\nnTask is a goal progress tracker that uses the Kanban board method. The Kanban\nboard allows you to set your goals and the deadlines that you need to achieve\nthem while allowing you to view all the details very clearly.\n\nThat way, you or your team can stay on the same page and ensure you\u2019re on\ntrack without risking missing any deadlines or wasting unnecessary time.\nAchieving that is great for maximizing productivity tool.\n\nOne downside that we saw while researching nTask is the lack of customer\nsupport. Existing users claimed that nTask takes a while to respond to\ntickets, which isn\u2019t ideal. However, if you don\u2019t plan on using their customer\nservice on a daily basis, then it\u2019s a wonderful goal-tracking app to use.\n\n### Habitica\n\nHabitica is one of the more unique goal apps to track your goals. With this\nprogress tracker app, you aren\u2019t just listing down the tasks that you have to\naccomplish. This app takes a gamified approach to accomplishing and finishing\nthe goals you\u2019ve set, which isn\u2019t something you will come across often on the\nmarket.\n\nWith Habitica, you have a character that goes through a medieval-style\nadventure world. From there, you can set your goals, and your progress is what\ndetermine what happens to your character in the game. This is a really cool\nway to track and smash through your goals.\n\nThe downside to this goal planner app is that it isn\u2019t free. It costs $5 per\nmonth but you can get a 20% discount if you go for the yearly membership.\n\n### Lifetick\n\nTaking a SMART approach to goal setting is something Lifetick really has\nnailed down. With this track progress app, you can set goals for just about\nany aspect of your life, including financial, health, professional,\nrelationships, and more.\n\nAnd since Lifetick uses SMART criteria, it\u2019s much easier to stay on track with\nyour goals and actually accomplish them.\n\nOn top of that, Lifetick also has social features. So, you can share your\ngoals and progress with family, friends, and colleagues. This could be a great\napp for people and teams who want to make sure they achieve every goal they\nset by keeping each other accountable.\n\nThe only real downside to Lifetick is that it\u2019s not free, but it\u2019s also super\naffordable. For instance, it costs just $1 per week for an individual\nsubscription and around $20 for a team.\n\n### ProProfs Project\n\nProProfs Project is another project management software that is perfect for\nsetting and keeping track of your goals. It\u2019s an all-in-one solution that will\nhelp you with planning, executing, and completing your goals.\n\nDo note that this app isn\u2019t designed for individual use. Like Everhour, it is\nprimarily designed for teams. Within the ProProfs Project app, you can access\nthe timesheet app, and time tracker so you conduct employee time tracking,\ngenerate performance reports, set tasks, assign members, and virtually\neverything you could possibly need for achieving a team goal.\n\nThe app itself is not free, but it\u2019s super affordable, costing just a few\ndollars per month per user. And the cool thing about it is that you can try it\nout for free for a total of 15 days.\n\n### Coach.me\n\nCoach.me is a unique type of goal-tracker. In fact, this app doubles as a goal\ntracker and a coaching app. Through the app, you can find like-minded\nindividuals that have the same or similar goals as you, meaning you can come\ntogether, keep each other accountable, and achieve your goals together.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about this app is that you\u2019ll get a coach to guide you\nthrough the entire process, making sure you\u2019re doing everything right and are\non track to achieving the goals that you\u2019ve set for yourself.\n\nThe beauty of Coach.me is that it works for just about any goal. Whether\nyou\u2019re a person with business or fitness goals, or you want to get rid of your\nbad procrastination habits, Coach.me could be the app you need.\n\nAnother cool feature of Coach.me is how it actually tracks your goals and\nprogress. With the app, you can set a goal and track your progress privately.\nHowever, you can also check the \u201cGet Props\u201d option, which allows other people\nin the community to check in and view your progress.\n\nOne downside of Coach.me is that it doesn\u2019t feel like (because it isn\u2019t) your\ntypical to-do app like Everhour or ClickUp.\n\n### Way of Life\n\nIf you\u2019re a serial procrastinator and want to set the goal of getting rid of\nthis nasty habit of yours, Way of Life is a fantastic progress-tracking app\nthat can help you achieve that goal. The beauty of this app is that it works\nthe same way for just about any habit that you want to correct.\n\nWay of Life is a simple, color-coded goal-planning app. It\u2019s very interactive\nand easy to navigate, making setting and keeping track of goals easy. You can\nview Way of Life as a simpler approach to journaling, which offers tons of\nbenefits for productivity and tracking your goals.\n\nThe only real downside to Way of Life is that it\u2019s quite limited in regard to\ncustomization and usage. You can only really find this app a suitable goal-\ntracking solution if you\u2019re looking to break free from bad habits.\n\n### Apple Notes\n\nWe wanted to include a very simple and effective goal-tracking application as\none of the 12 apps for daily goals on this list that everybody can use, and\nfrom the lot, we believe that Apple Notes really is the best one.\n\nApple Notes is one of the best goal tracking apps today. It has a very\nintuitive interface and offers a fantastic user experience. Setting and\nkeeping track of your daily, weekly, or yearly goals is super easy. And the\nbest thing about it? It\u2019s free and you don\u2019t even need to have an iPhone or an\nApple product to use it. Simply register an iCloud account and you can access\nApple Notes right away.\n\nThe downside to the Apple Notes goal-setting app is that you can\u2019t track time\nto see how long a particular task or goal has taken you to achieve, assign\nother members of your team to the said tasks, create cards, or use it for\nlarge projects. It\u2019s very much a personal progress app.\n\n## Conclusion: What Are the Best Goal Tracking Apps?\n\nIf you browse the market for the best goal-tracking or job-tracking app,\nyou\u2019ll come across many different options to pick from. To help you pick the\nbest goals app for your needs, we listed 12 of our favorites, Everhour being\nour number one pick. And no, we\u2019re totally not biased!\n\nWhat\u2019s important to remember is that no matter which best goal app you decide\nto use to track your goals, it\u2019s way more important that you focus on actually\nachieving the goals than plotting them down and keeping track of them. You can\nplan and evaluate the best way to track your goals as long as you want, but in\nthe end, consistent action is what will help you achieve your goals.\n\n  *   *   * \n\n#### Maria Kharlantseva\n\nMaria is a proud content guardian with experience working for international\nteams and projects of different complexities.

It's\nsimilar to a minimum usage fee, ensuring access to the service. Even if you\nhave 2 or 3 users, you'll be charged for a minimum of 5 seats.  \n  \n\nWhat's the difference between 'user' and 'seat'?\n\nEssentially, a 'user' and a 'seat' are the same, except removing a user\ndoesn't automatically remove the seat. This flexibility allows you to replace\nusers without prorating or issuing a separate invoice. You can archive or\ndelete people who've left your company and invite new ones without having to\nchange your seat count every time.  \n  \n\nDo you offer discounts?\n\nOpting for annual payment saves you 15%. Keep in mind, this discount requires\na commitment, and we don't refund unused months upon cancellation.\nAdditionally, volume discounts are available for accounts with over 100 seats.  \n  \n\nCan I cancel my subscription at any time?\n\nYes! If Everhour isn't the right fit, cancel before your next billing period\n(as listed on your billing page). Unfortunately, we can't refund partial use\nor the remaining time in your subscription.  \n  \n\nWhat payment methods are accepted?\n\nCurrently, we only accept credit or debit card payments.  \n  \n\nIn which currency will I be charged?\n\nWe charge in US dollars, but the actual debit currency depends on your card\nand bank.  \n  \n\n## Compare the plans\n\n### Gain deeper insights into the features offered within each plan.\n\n| Free | Team  \n---|---|---  \n**Time tracking**  \n  \n**Timer or manual entry**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Time entry notes**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Add time for team members**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Timesheet view**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Favorite time entries**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Timer button on popular websites**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Native integrations & sync**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Clock-in, clock-out, breaks**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Optional screenshots**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Personal time tracking reminders**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Auto-stop timer**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Overtime**\n\n|  | __  \n**Project management**  \n  \n**Manage tasks**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Set estimates**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Project templates**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**List or Board views**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Real-time team timers**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Saved reports**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Export**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Summary emails**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Schedule reports via email**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Folders**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Timeline**\n\n|  | __  \n**Team management**  \n  \n**User groups**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Team roles**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Custom access level management**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Resource planning**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Lock time editing**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Time audits**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Time approval**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Time off, vacations, absence**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Single sign-on (SSO)**\n\n|  | __  \n**Billing and budgeting**  \n  \n**Clients**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Project billing types**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Team member billable ratess**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Custom task rates**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Budgets**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Overlimit notifications**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Expenses**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Invoices**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Copy invoices to QuickBooks or Xero**\n\n|  | __  \n**Integrations**  \n  \n**Timer button on popular websites**\n\n| __| __  \n  \n**Native integrations & sync**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Copy Outlook, gCal, iCal events**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Zapier**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**API**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n**Jira sync**\n\n|  | __  \n  \n## Take control of your time with Everhour\n\n### Beautiful integrations.
