Peter\u2019s quote from 1969 still stands today and highlights the\nimportance of setting and following through on goals.\n\nHowever, in 1969, setting and tracking goals required not much more than a\npiece of paper and determination. Nowadays, there are countless apps,\nschedulers, project management tools, spreadsheets, and all types of modern\ndevices for tracking goals.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll show you some of the very best apps you can find online for\ntracking your goals, whether they\u2019re related to your personal or business\nlife.\n\n## Timely\n\nThe best apps are those where you don\u2019t have to struggle to adopt and use them\nevery day. With Timely, you can not only track your time without being\ninterrupted, but you can also track your goals and tasks within our app.\n\nThe philosophy we have is that even the biggest goal won\u2019t seem all that huge\nonce it\u2019s broken down into smaller, bite-sized tasks. This is what you can do\nin the task list view in Timely, and create individual tasks for yourself or\nthe rest of your team.\n\nThe task view is a superb way to break down what you have to do and stack it\nup against your week or month. And the best part is you can track your time in\nTimely and add it to each task that you have set for yourself.\n\nThat means that you get to see progress on your tasks in real-time, motivating\nyou to push harder to reach your goals. And what\u2019s even cooler is that Timely\nis completely surveillance free. There are no screenshots, screen recordings,\nactivity monitoring or anything else your employees won\u2019t appreciate.\n\nTimely works just as well for personal as it does for your business goals. And\nthe best part is, you can try it out for free without any commitment first.\nPaid plans start at $9 per user per month.\n\n## Strides\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to crush your fitness goals and need an app to hold you\naccountable, or you\u2019re a solopreneur trying to keep everything in one place,\nStrides is a great way to set and track your goals.\n\nThe app is set up to track four different types of goals:\n\n  * Habits (e.g. quitting smoking, drinking enough water every day)\n  * Targets (e.g. completing a certain number of orders)\n  * Averages (e.g. maintaining a certain number of steps walked on a weekly/monthly basis)\n  * Projects (completing larger tasks in smaller increments)\n\nIf you\u2019ve never set any goals on your own, Strides can help you do that with\ntheir simple 3-step process. You can get daily or weekly reports and show\ncharts with your progress to get you motivated on the way to crushing those\ngoals.\n\nYou can use Strides for one major goal that you have set out for yourself or\ntailor the app so that it contains your entire daily schedule. You\u2019ll get\ndaily updates on your progress through the phone app, so you don\u2019t lose sight\nof your goals.\n\nAs for the downsides, the app is only available on iOs devices, which means no\nAndroid and no browser-based apps are available. The app is free to download\nand use, and there is an in-app purchase of $4.99 per month to unlock premium\nfeatures such as progress reports.\n\n## Trello\n\nIf you\u2019ve never used an app for tracking goals at work, you might want to\nstart with Trello. The reason is simple - it\u2019s the most intuitive out of all\nthe project management apps, and you can get started in minutes, even if\nyou\u2019ve never used something like this before.\n\nTrello functions as a Kanban board where you add different columns (e.g., for\nstages in completing a certain goal) and cards within those columns. Usually,\ncards represent smaller tasks, but you can go beyond that and create larger\ntasks with checklists under one card.\n\nYou can then tick off those items, and the progress bar for each card moves\nalong. It\u2019s also possible to format the cards with different tag colors,\nimages, and more.\n\nYou may think that the best thing about Trello is how customizable it is. We\u2019d\nargue that the best thing about this app is the value that you can get out of\nthe free version, as there are very few limitations. Paid plans start at $5\nper user per month.\n\n## ClickUp\n\nIf you love your project management apps, but Trello seems way too simple for\nyour taste, then ClickUp might be a great fit. It can be used both for work,\nand your personal goals, and the level of detail and customization you can do\nis truly endless.\n\nGoals are the highest in the hierarchy in ClickUp, and you can set high-level\ngoals and accompany them with Targets. Targets are specific KPIs that you can\nwork towards, e.g., writing a certain number of words/articles monthly in my\ncase.\n\nYou can create goal scorecards and store your individual goals, discerning\nbetween different goal types or business/personal goals. Moreover, you can\ntrack your progress weekly and get a visual representation of what you\u2019re\ndoing (or not).\n\nThis barely scratches the surface of ClickUp\u2019s capabilities, as it\u2019s a\nversatile tool that can be used by teams as large as hundreds of people.\nHaving said that, it might be a bit too complex for a single person who wants\nto stay on top of their goals.\n\nYou can try it out for free, though, and see for yourself. You\u2019ll get 100MB of\nstorage and unlimited tasks, which is a great starting point. Paid plans start\nat $5 per user per month.\n\n## Weekdone\n\nAnd now for something a bit different. Weekdone is not your typical project\nmanagement software - it\u2019s an OKR platform where you can set quarterly\nobjectives and get weekly updates on your progress. Needless to say, it\u2019s more\nfor a business use case rather than a personal one.\n\nThe main unit of measurement in Weekdone is the OKR - these are the mammoth\ngoals you set for a quarter. Based on them, you can set monthly and weekly\ngoals within the app to get you closer to the OKRs in incremental steps.\n\nOnce the plan is laid out, you can view it hierarchically in Weekdone, so you\nget a bird\u2019s eye view of things as they unfold.\n\nYou can use the app completely free if you have up to 3 people in your team.\nThe pricing structure is a bit unusual, so the cheapest you can pay is $90 per\nmonth, which gets you access to all the features for a team of 4-10 people.\n\n## Way of Life\n\nJudging by the very name of the app, you can tell that Way of Life is meant\nfor individuals looking to set and achieve their personal goals. Similarly to\nStrides, it\u2019s available on mobile devices (iOs and Android), and it\u2019s a\nlightweight, easy-to-use tool for personal goal management.\n\nWithin Way of Life, it\u2019s more about achieving bigger goals through everyday\nhabits, and that\u2019s what the app is really about. You set daily habits for\nyourself and use the app to remind you to stay on track, as well as show you\nvisual cues of your progress.\n\nThe user experience is definitely the app\u2019s strong side, as you can choose\nfrom a variety of color-coded themes in their system to display progress. You\ncan even add your notes to a personal diary in the app.\n\nThe app is completely free to download and use. However, there are in-app\npurchases of $4.99 per month to buy the premium version.\n\n## Habitica\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to feel like setting and working towards goals is dragging\nyou down, perhaps you just need a different way of doing things. Instead of\ntask lists and progress bars, Habitica lets you do goal setting in the form of\na game.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward - you set good and bad habits, and they\u2019re\nattributed to minuses and pluses. Each time you do something good, you get a\n+, and you\u2019re rewarded, e.g., eating a healthy meal. Do something negative\n(such as getting an alcoholic drink), and you get a minus.\n\nThat reflects on your character in Habitica and how they feel. The more tasks\nyou tick off, the better health your characters have. There\u2019s also a chance\nyou can get special items in the game that will make your journey even easier.\n\nYou can try the app for free, and paid options start at $5 per month.\n\n## GoalsOnTrack\n\nPrepare to set your goals high because GoalsOnTrack calls itself the goal\nsoftware for high achievers. It does this by taking larger goals and breaking\nthem up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Of course, the weight of goal\nsetting is on you.\n\nAt the very start, you create larger goals, and thanks to the app\u2019s forms, you\ncan make sure that they are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,\nand time-bound). From that point, it\u2019s easy to figure out how to create\nsubtasks for your larger goals.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to rack your brains because you can create goals from a\ntemplate if you get stuck. Within the dashboard, you can manage your tasks and\neven track your time and make journal entries as you go.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a mixed bag of things, and it\u2019s much better suited to personal\nrather than business use.\n\nYou can try the app for free, and if you want to continue using it, there\u2019s\nonly the annual plan available. It costs $68 per year, and there\u2019s a 30-day\nmoney-back guarantee if you\u2019re not happy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSetting and tracking goals don\u2019t have to be a chore. Whether you want to do it\nfor yourself or as a part of your work routine, there are apps that let you\ncut out the noise and focus on the work. Today, we\u2019ve shown you some of the\nvery best, depending on your needs and use case.\n\nSpeaking of which, tracking your time is an amazing way to ensure you\u2019re doing\neverything to meet and exceed your goals. Start tracking your time with Timely\ntoday, and you\u2019ll see just how much you\u2019re doing to meet your goals every day.\n\n##  **Related articles**\n\nNo items found.\n\nTry Timely today!\n\nDiscover the power of **Timely's** automated time tracking now!\n\nStart your free trial\n\nBook a demo\n\n30 people or more?

handle on budgets and business costs after creating accurate\nworked time reports in Timely\n\nWe\u2019ve now just started to properly use the time budgeting, especially on large\nprojects, so now it\u2019s mostly running reports. We go in to run a time report on\neach member of staff, how long they\u2019ve used it to create a project, whether\nthat project is over/under the time budget assigned.\u201d\n\n **Sophie Warner**\n\n **Director of Operations**\n\nProactive project estimations and budget control\n\n\u201cBy capturing every hour that goes into each project, we can follow project\nbudget spend to proactively manage the return of our work\u2026 [and] calculate\nbetter base hourly rates for future projects.\u201d\n\n **Oskari Leino**\n\nDirector of Business Control & Operations\n\nCorsearch keeps OpEx low and makes better staffing decisions with Timely\n\n\"Reports help us make decisions on a weekly basis about team capacity and\nhires. Now we manage our costs better, to the point where we actually use the\ntime that we have as a company to create value for clients.\"\n\n **Ivan Rainovski**\n\n **Delivery Director at Corsearch**\n\nWalpole reduced sunk time and labour costs on unrewarding contracts\n\n\"In the past, we never had 'lessons learned' after-the-fact. There was no\ntransparency over effort put in. A project could have been costing the\nbusiness more than it was making. With Timely we discovered that we lost 50\nhours on unproductive deals.\u201d\n\n **Stuart Wymant**\n\n **Customer Success Manager**\n\nMore time for client work.\n\n\"Timely has taken the time tracking workload from our consultants and freed\ntheir time for more important work.  \n  \nBefore Timely, it took me two hours a week to track my time across all tasks,\nclients and projects. I had to create another time entry for tracking the\ntime, which was totally inefficient.\u201d\n\n **Christopher Schwarz**\n\n **Consultant**\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nFind answers to the questions we get asked the most about our subscriptions.\n\n **What is Unlimited+?**\n\nThere\u2019s no hard and fast rules when it comes to Unlimited+ plans here at\nTimely.
