The \u201cgoals\u201d feature is only available in the Business\nsubscription, but both the Basic and Premium plans offer a task-tracking\nfeature that can double as a manual goal-tracking system for smaller teams.\n\n### Trello\n\nTrello is a Kanban-style web application with an emphasis on increasing\nproductivity.
