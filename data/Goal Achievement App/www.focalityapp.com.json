You break your goals down into steps and order\nthem into a timeline. The trouble is: No plan survives contact with reality.\nThings won't go as expected, conditions change, life happens. Then you have to\nupdate your plan - the whole sequence. A hassle at best, motivation killer at\nworst.\n\nWith deep planning, you don't create sequential plans. Instead, you create a\nhierarchy. **Think about what you want to achieve for your goal this year**.\nBased on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today?\n\nThis way you can easily plan your life strategically and adjust your plans\nwith little effort.\n\n## Self-Reflection\n\nLife is learning. To achieve your goals you have to constantly adjust and\nimprove your approach. Self-reflection is the tool to just that.\n\nAt the end of each planning period, your **goal achievement app** Focality\nwill ask you to look back. What went well? What not? How can you improve?\nThink about your achievements and your potential.\n\nBy making this an integral part of the process, self-improvement will become\nsecond nature to you.\n\n## A Goal Achievement App for iOS, Android and the Web\n\nUse Focality on any device.

Always know what to focus on right now.\n\nUnleash your potential\n\nUse self-reflection and data-driven insights to unleash your potential.\n\n  1.   2.   3.   4.   5.   6. \n\nBe proactive\n\nAct, don't react. Take control of your life and form it proactively.\n\nBe relaxed\n\nStop feeling overwhelmed.
