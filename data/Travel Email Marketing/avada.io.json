Learn more about our methodology\n\nSam\n\nAuthor\n\nDaniel\n\nResearcher\n\n##### Drive 20-40% of your revenue with Avada\n\nGet Started\n\nTo communicate with their customers nowadays, travel agencies need a solid\ndigital marketing strategy. It\u2019s not like in the past when folks thinking\nabout taking a trip would walk into a brick-and-mortar travel agency. Of\ncourse, this still occurs, but it is becoming uncommon.\n\nThe great majority of passengers today book their travels and conduct their\nresearch online. Your website and social media sites, for example, are\nexcellent digital tools for communicating with customers. Email, on the other\nhand, is one of the finest ways to stay in touch. You don\u2019t have to wait for\nvisitors to visit your pages if you use email. You can contact them ahead of\ntime and direct them where you want them to go.\n\nIn this article, I will share with you **everything you need to know to get\nstarted with travel email marketing,** as well as **some great tips that you\ncan implement right away to grow your travel business.** Let\u2019s jump right into\nthe details!\n\nAvada SEO Suite\n\n4.9\n\nAvada Boost Sales\n\n5.0\n\nAvada Email Marketing\n\n4.9\n\n## Benefits of Email Marketing for the Travel Industry\n\nFirst and foremost, let us discuss why email is so vital for travel\nbusinesses. It is predicted that there will be 2.9 billion email users on the\nearth in 2019. While we\u2019re piling on big figures to illustrate our point, keep\nin mind that 105 billion emails are sent every day, with that figure\nanticipated to rise to 246 billion by 2023. There are various other reasons\nwhy you should use email in your travel business:\n\n  * **It is very affordable.** Email marketing is one of the most affordable marketing methods available today.\n  * **It\u2019s easy to implement.** You can develop and launch your first email campaign in just 30 minutes thanks to free HTML email templates.\n  * **It\u2019s laser-focused.** You may send to a specific list with one clear call to action, allowing you to reach a relevant audience and achieve your goal.\n  * **It\u2019s straightforward.** It\u2019s basic enough that your marketing intern can take over as necessary. You may use a drag-and-drop editor to create an email that will dazzle your creative team while also producing results that will wow your boss.\n  * **It is effective.** Email is predicted to deliver $42 for every $1 spent when done correctly.\n\n## What are the key elements of a successful travel marketing email?\n\nThe following are some elements you should include in every travel marketing\nemail you write:\n\n  * **Personalization:** More than half of travel marketing experts consider personalization as a game-changing approach for email marketing in competitive markets. A personalized email makes the recipient feel special and helps them connect with your brand. Segmentation and customization work together to produce more useful and personalized content.\n  * **Attention-grabbing subject lines:** this tip applies to all email marketing campaigns. Writing strong email subject lines should be a requirement for all email marketers because mastery of this skill reduces instances of improper spam-tagging and increases open rates.\n  * **Videos.** Emails containing attached videos often receive a large increase in total engagement. It is possible to notice a 19% boost in open rates and a 65 percent rise in click-through rates. It is also perfect for the travel and hotel industries. Videos are an excellent approach to show potential tourists different types of accommodations, excursions, and destinations.\n  * **Urgency.** Similar to personalization and an emphasis on subject lines, promoting interaction through a sense of urgency is advantageous for email marketing in general. It is worth noting, however, that they are especially effective with travel companies. Nothing beats flash travel sales and limited-time bargains when it comes to planning a holiday.\n  * **An easy way for subscribers to spread the word.** Solitary excursions are less common than group holidays. Allow your subscribers to easily recommend and extend your vacation packages to their friends and family. They can always forward your email, but social-sharing buttons are also a pleasant touch.\n\n## Types of emails for travel marketing\n\n### 1\\. The warm welcome\n\nThese are frequently a sequence of messages that are triggered by email list\nsignups. Engagement statistics degrade when they are not automated. Automated\nwelcome emails may have an open rate of more than 85% and a click-through rate\nof 29%.\n\nWhen delivered manually, open rates fall to 52%, while click-through rates\nfall to 12%. A double opt-in, an introduction to your company, and a reminder\nto set their email preferences can all be included in this series of emails.\n\n### 2\\. The newsletter\n\nThe newsletter is a versatile format that may be used to provide travelers\nwith getaway ideas, announce your latest packages and tour alternatives, share\ntravel industry news, or debut a new perk or service.\n\nThese emails boost your credibility in travel and hospitality topics. A\nsatisfied client testimonial is another popular sort of content in a travel\nbusiness newsletter. They are equally effective as internet reviews and can\neven be delivered in video format for maximum impact.\n\n### 3\\. The seasonal or milestone offer\n\nThe average person cannot afford to take a vacation for every holiday,\nbirthday, and anniversary celebration. That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be open to\nyour travel suggestions.\n\nPromotions centered around holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, or\neven an unusual one such as Cinco de Mayo are not uncommon. Campaigns for\nspring break and summer vacations may also be launched.\n\nWhile conversions are the obvious goal, the truly winning method is to\nintroduce subscribers to potential possibilities. Even if they aren\u2019t ready\nnow, members will remember and respect your knowledge when it comes time to\nbook a long-awaited vacation.\n\n### 4\\. The booking confirmation\n\nWhen a retail brand processes a purchase, they frequently send an email\nreceipt. Booking confirmations are practically the same thing. Because\npassengers frequently examine these travel agency emails more than once, they\nhave almost unrealistically high open rates.\n\nWith those open rates, it\u2019s worth including more conversion and income\nchances. Think about cross-selling or upselling.\n\n### 5\\. The informational message\n\nMore than 75% of passengers believe that educational content influences their\ndecision-making abilities. The objective here is to present yourself as a\ncaring and supporting brand to your current and prospective clients.\n\nYou can forewarn travelers about adverse weather or tourist attraction\nscheduling snafus before they arrive. You can create destination-specific\ntravel guides to deliver to new subscribers. This can range from tourist trips\nto basic foreign language phrases.\n\n### 6\\. The thank you email\n\nConsider the thank you note a supplement to your informational emails. After\nstaying in touch with your subscribers throughout their customer journey\u2014from\nplanning and pre-arrival to traveling and returning home\u2014a thank-you note is\nalmost anticipated.\n\nConsider including a link to a survey to collect feedback that you can use to\nimprove the services your brand offers.\n\n### 7\\. The loyalty or referral program\n\nFrequent travellers will appreciate being a part of an up-to-date loyalty\nprogram. You can design the latter scheme to be point-based or just offer flat\ndiscounts on specific services. Rewards for attaining milestones and birthday\nsurprises are other excellent features. A referral program driven by your\nloyalty program may also assist you in expanding your email list and\nincreasing your conversion rate.\n\n### 8\\. The re-engagement email\n\nAre the majority of your subscribers new or prospective travelers rather than\nrepeat customers? If this is the case, you may strengthen your loyalty program\nor try executing a re-engagement campaign to remind members why they signed up\nfor your email list in the first place.\n\n## 10 strategies for successful travel email marketing\n\nUnderstanding the importance of email marketing in the travel and hospitality\nindustries is merely the first step in establishing your brand\u2019s email\nmarketing strategy. The next step is to begin brainstorming email marketing\nideas to deliver to those who have subscribed to your email list. Do you need\nassistance getting started? Here are ten pointers to help you with your\nplanning:\n\n### 1\\. Give new subscribers a warm welcome\n\nWhen a traveler subscribes to your emails, it\u2019s time to welcome them. Send a\nwelcome email to your new subscriber with a pleasant greeting and information\nthat encourages the subscriber to discover more about your company.\n\nYou can schedule welcome emails to land in a subscriber\u2019s mailbox soon after\nthey sign up. According to Experian, welcome emails delivered in real time\nhave an 88 percent open rate and a 29 percent click-through rate, which is\nmuch greater than welcome emails sent in batches, which had 52 percent open\nrates and 12 percent click-through rates.\n\nHere\u2019s a nice example of a welcome email issued to new subscribers by Fairmont\nHotels. It encourages subscribers to visit places where Fairmont Hotels are\navailable:\n\n### 2\\. Send travel inspirations\n\nWith so many destinations to visit, your subscribers will need some\ninspiration. According to the 2016 Virtuoso Luxe Report, a growing percentage\nof travelers are preferring to visit lesser-known locations or non-touristy\ndestinations.\n\nCreate and send emails that highlight exotic places to visit. Whatever\ndestinations you promote, make sure they are accompanied by stunning photos.\nImages not only capture attention, but they also assist travelers in imagining\nthemselves sitting under a palm tree or strolling through the streets of a\ncity.\n\nFlight Centre does an excellent job of enticing subscribers with these\nnewsletter-style emails that highlight fantastic destinations (with engaging\nphotos) at affordable prices. The secret to the success of these emails is\nthat Flight Centre combines data on its consumers with dynamic content to\npresent bargains that appeal to tastes, prior purchases, and online surfing\nactivities.\n\n### 3\\. Send personalized travel ideas and offers\n\nWhile sending emails with entertaining travel destinations is a good start,\nyou can improve your email game by personalizing such communications, as seen\nin the Flight Centre email. A tailored email is more relevant to a subscriber,\nincreasing the likelihood that he or she will open it and click through.\n\nTo personalize emails, collect information from subscribers or leverage data\nfrom third-party apps such as your booking software, ecommerce app, or CRM.\nEvery piece of information you obtain gives you a better understanding of your\ncustomer and allows you to deliver tailored travel offers.\n\nDuring their email sign-up process, Air Canada encourages new subscribers to\nprovide their home airport as well as the places they are interested in\nvisiting. Using this information, the company sends promotions tailored to the\nsubscriber\u2019s preferences. The flight packages depart from the subscriber\u2019s\nhome airport\u2014in this case, Montreal\u2014and travel to destinations of the\nsubscriber\u2019s choosing.\n\n### 4\\. Send gift ideas on holidays\n\nSend travel ideas when a holiday arrives. People are always looking for the\nperfect present, so why not encourage them to think beyond the box?\n\nOn Mother\u2019s Day, Flight Centre issued an email to its customers saying,\n\u201cBrunch is nice, but a trip is better.\u201d It\u2019s amusing, topical, and, most\nimportantly, it has the potential to generate two bookings rather than just\none.\n\nSubscribers in this sample can enter to win a Mother\u2019s Day trip by providing\nfeedback. You might attempt that, or you could simply send a promotional email\non a holiday of your choosing.\n\n### 5\\. Send testimonials\n\nTravelers aren\u2019t only looking for the cheapest trip; they\u2019re also checking\nreviews. According to TripAdvisor data, 93 percent of travelers worldwide say\nInternet reviews affect their booking decisions.\n\nBecause tourists rely so heavily on reviews, why not help them out with that?\nConsider sending an email with numerous testimonials from satisfied customers\nand include a link to read more.\n\nFairmont Hotels sends this testimonial email with a CTA that directs readers\nto read real-life guest stories.\n\n### 6\\. Have a loyalty program\n\nLoyalty is a difficult concept to grasp in the travel and hospitality\nindustries. Travelers are more likely to look for the best deals than to favor\na specific brand. If you, however, have a rewards program, you can use it to\ndrive customer loyalty and repeat business.\n\nAccording to Accenture, users of a loyalty program produced 12 to 18 percent\nhigher revenue for a business than non-members in 2016. Send emails to current\nsubscribers about the program and its benefits. Include a call to action that\ndirects readers to a simple signup form. Here\u2019s a Fairmont Hotels email that\ndoes just that:\n\n### 7\\. Provides incentives for loyal customers\n\nAfter subscribers have joined your loyalty program, you can send niche-\nspecific emails. Consider breaking this list down into smaller categories\nbased on travelling habits, popular vacation spots, or region. By segmenting\nyour list, you can give travelers with relevant trip suggestions and\nincentives that drive them to act.\n\nFor example, you might email subscribers in Los Angeles about a vacation\ndiscount that departs from LAX, or you might give members double points for\nmaking a reservation. British Airways is giving its frequent flyer members the\nopportunity to double their air points by booking a ticket within the next 45\ndays. The email even mentions the member\u2019s current point status.\n\nBy using email marketing to promote its loyalty program, British Airways can\nencourage more travelers to book a trip.\n\n### 8\\. Sell experiences\n\nTravelers want an experience, not simply a destination. As a result, it is\ncritical to promote the activities that are available to travellers. You may\ncreate memorable experiences by focusing on the trip rather than the\ndestination.\n\nFor example, don\u2019t simply promote low room prices; also promote all of the\nservices available at your hotel. Send an email promoting your business center\nto business travelers, or tell families about the Olympic-sized pool that will\nkeep the youngsters entertained.\n\nConsider how you may provide passengers with a one-of-a-kind experience, as\nVirgin Experience Days does with this email that offers a chance to go virtual\nreality skydiving.\n\n### 9\\. Offer limited-time deals\n\nAccording to Google, 76% of business travelers and 70% of leisure travelers\nbook with a certain brand based on pricing.\n\nGiven the importance of exceptional pricing, send emails to your subscribers\noffering them the opportunity to enjoy a fantastic trip at an unbelievable\nprice. Put a time limit on these promotions to show subscribers how appealing\nthey are.\n\nThe short deadline should motivate subscribers to act quickly. Flight Centre\nemployed this concept in a recent email that advertised low-cost flights to\nNew York City. Flight Centre included a countdown clock at the bottom of the\nemail to emphasize the limited-time offer.\n\n### 10\\. Create a sense of urgency\n\nAccording to Expedia data, the average traveler takes 45 days to arrange a\nholiday. However, not every traveler devotes that much time to planning.\n\nIn fact, some travelers want to get away as soon as possible. With a\ncan\u2019t-resist email offer, give subscribers the opportunity to take an\nimpromptu trip. Flight Centre emailed users with a link to last-minute\ngetaways starting at $530.\n\n## 8 Great Travel email examples to inspire your next campaign\n\nIt\u2019s (nearly) summer, which means it\u2019s a great time for exotic holidays and\nweekend getaways. It also means that travel technology services marketers are\nworking harder than ever to outperform the competition and win over last-\nminute planners in their inboxes.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled a list of some of our favorite travel email samples. Sit back,\nrelax, and daydream about beautiful lands!\n\n### 1\\. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb always nails the subscriber experience, but this recent email with a\nscrolling carousel of their \u201cexperiences.\u201d is absolutely amazing. I was\nimmediately drawn in by the captivating subject line and the bold, clean\nstyle, and I knew this wasn\u2019t simply another business-as-usual campaign.\n\n### 2\\. JetBlue\n\nJetBlue outperforms the competition with their conversational copy and mobile-\nresponsive, scrollable emails. This one is particularly clever because it\nincludes a list of options that are all centered on a single theme: Travel\ndestinations where you do not require a passport. Even though there are\nseveral ways to go, it keeps the message focused.\n\n### 3\\. Koloa Landing\n\nThis fantastic automated welcome email is simply stunning in terms of\nappearance \u2013 but it\u2019s also great in terms of strategy. It is triggered\nimmediately after a new subscriber joins Koloa Landing\u2019s email list and asks\nthe new member to \u201cintroduce themselves\u201d by setting up their preferences. It\u2019s\na wonderful approach to get started sending relevant, targeted communications\nright away.\n\n### 4\\. The Clymb\n\nThis is one thing to keep in mind while designing an email for a travel\nbusiness? Above all, use visuals to lead. You probably already have beautiful\nphoto assets that you can utilize to create a wonderful picture for your\nsubscribers of how they\u2019d feel in various locations. Tell that tale using\nstriking, high-quality images to elicit an emotional response and inspire\naction.\n\n### 6\\. Jetsetter\n\nSometimes the simplest solution is the best. This email from Jetsetter\nminimizes distraction by simplifying the way here: Choose a destination that\nappeals to you from this no-fuss collection of tiles. By lowering friction,\nyou enhance the likelihood of your subscribers taking action and visiting your\nwebsite.\n\n### 7\\. Hipmunk\n\nHipmunk has a distinct brand and voice, which is reflected in this welcome\nemail. The humorous drawings let you rapidly grasp the core of the message\nwithout having to read it all, and it all comes together with a contrasting\nhumorous CTA button at the bottom.\n\n### 8\\. Southwest\n\nSouthwest delivers a fantastic annual summary to Rapid Rewards members to\nremind them of their trips and points earned over the previous year.
