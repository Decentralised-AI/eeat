Learn how to craft email\nmarketing campaigns that get noticed and win conversions for your travel\nbusiness.\n\nVIP CONTRIBUTOR Tom McLoughlin\n\n  * April 1, 2021\n  * \u22c5\n  * 13 min read\n\nVIP CONTRIBUTOR Tom McLoughlin Director at SEO Travel\n\nBio\n\nFollow\n\n  *   * \n\n  * 670\n\nSHARES\n\n  * 4.3K\n\nREADS\n\nThe travel industry is a fiercely competitive place and inboxes are jam-packed\nthese days. When it comes to email marketing, you really need to stand out.\n\nAll of the best travel companies in the business are using email marketing to\nkeep in touch with existing customers, interact with high-quality leads and\nbuild a stronger and more meaningful relationship with their audience.\n\nIt\u2019s fast, cost-effective, and has one of the best return-on-investment (ROI)\nrates of any marketing channel \u2014 $38 in ROI for every $1 spent, according to\nCampaignMonitor.\n\nBut with so much email content already on the market for travelers, how do you\nensure that yours isn\u2019t sent to Trash unread?\n\nUnderstanding the best ways to engage and inspire your target audience with\nemail content is a simple process \u2014 that is, once you\u2019ve got your head around\nhow to segment your mailing lists and craft engaging emails.\n\nIn this column, you\u2019ll find tips and advice for travel businesses who want to\ntake their email marketing to the next level.\n\nLet\u2019s get started.\n\n****\n\nSome email marketing experts will tell you to collect as many contact details\nas possible on your site to ensure that your mailing list is wide-reaching.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that the majority of readers just aren\u2019t\ngoing to be interested in what you have to say.\n\nYou\u2019ll be much more successful if you use carefully crafted lead magnets to\ncapitalize on people who are already interested in what you have to offer,\nrather than using a basic \u201copt-in\u201d box.\n\nSay you have an article on your website\u2019s blog that features unique advice for\ntravelers planning on visiting Italy with children, for example.\n\nYou\u2019ve studied your site analytics and know that this post gets a high volume\nof visitors every month.\n\nYou also know that a significant proportion of your customer base is parents\nwho travel with their children.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect opportunity to use a lead magnet.\n\nAt the bottom of this post, you could include a call to action that tells the\nreader that they can receive more specialist travel advice from your email\nnewsletter if they enter their email address.\n\nEven better, have an eye-pleasing pop-up that tempts users with a valuable\nfree download of a child-friendly travel guide to Italy or access to a list of\nthe best family restaurants in Rome.\n\nThis will entice users to opt-in to your list and give them value.\n\nThey sign up, and you gain a potential customer who is already engaging with\nthe content you produce and therefore is already more likely to respond well\nto other marketing material.\n\nBoom! A warm lead straight into your customer database or email marketing\nplatform.\n\nYou can use this process to create lead magnets across your site that target\ndifferent members of your audience with different intents and interests.\n\nA good starting point is to analyze which pages are receiving the most amount\nof traffic, identify who is visiting and engaging with the content on there,\nand create a lead magnet that adds value to them.\n\nThe simplest way to operate your email marketing strategy is by using software\nthat automates the process.\n\nWe favor GetResponse, but there are plenty of different providers out there.\n\nAutomation software allows you to create specialized email pathways for\ncustomers who opt-in, tailoring the content they receive based on what brought\nthem to your site in the first place and what they interact with after that.\n\nThis not only makes your job a lot easier but allows you to accurately monitor\nthe success of each email pathway and identify where your readers are engaging\nand where they might be dropping out.\n\nA standard example of an automated email pathway begins with a potential\ncustomer entering their email somewhere on your site, prompted by a lead\nmagnet.\n\nThey will then receive a welcome email from your travel company, explaining a\nlittle bit about who you are and what you do.\n\nThis welcome email will also feature several links to other relevant pieces of\ncontent or pages on your website, which the reader might then click on.\n\nThe content that is featured in this welcome email can be tailored depending\non what encouraged the reader to first give you their email address.\n\nSo, if they came to your mailing list through an article about visiting Italy\nwith children, you\u2019ll want to link them to more articles about family\nholidays, visiting Italy, or family-friendly activities in Italy.\n\nA series of specific branch emails will set up within your software will send\nregularly based on data such as whether the reader clicks on a specific link\nwithin the email or visits your site and starts browsing.\n\nYou get a clear idea of what your customer base is looking at and engaging\nwith, and the automation does the hard work.\n\nThe delivery of these automated emails can also be tailored to the location\nand time zone of their recipients, to increase the likelihood of them being\nread.\n\nMany pieces of email marketing software also let you take this one step\nfurther and gather data on what time of day your recipients usually open your\nemails.\n\nYou can then choose to send further emails at this time, which again will\nincrease the number of people who open and engage with the content you have\nshared.\n\nNot bad for a simple bit of automation, right?\n\n##\n\nWhen it comes to adding value through your email marketing, segmentation is\nkey.\n\nWhile some huge travel businesses can get away with sending generic emails to\ntheir entire customer base, this simply won\u2019t reap the same results for the\nvast majority.\n\nSplitting your recipients into different groups based on their interests and\nwhat content they engage with the most is the best way to ensure you are only\ndelivering valuable content to your audience.\n\nAs you gather more data on which emails and content are the most successful\nwith each group, you can further personalize the content you send out. This\ncan increase engagement and improve conversion rates.\n\nIncluding links to other pages, posts and pieces of content on your company\u2019s\nwebsite allows you to collect data on what each recipient clicks on.\n\nThe next emails that the users receive will be based on what kind of content\nthey engaged with and enjoyed most.\n\nUsing the automation process outlined above, you can personalize the email\npathways for each of these groups, building out the options as you go, based\non how the user interacts with your communications.\n\nIncluding follow-up emails in your automated process that ask whether your\nreader enjoyed the recommended content is a great way to engage your audience\nand gain valuable feedback.\n\nCreate a simple link click-based voting system that will allow you to gather\nfurther valuable insight. The data you gather from this allows you to\nintelligently usher your customer down your marketing/sales funnel and drive\nmore conversions.\n\nBy continuing this process, you gain a detailed understanding of what your\nmailing list is looking for and can continue to personalize their emails to\nkeep delivering valuable and engaging information.\n\nYou also become a trusted source of information and a thought leader in your\nspace.\n\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for it.\n\nA recent study done by Google and Phocuswright revealed that 36% of travelers\nare more likely to pay more for the services of a travel business if the\ninformation and trip ideas they were given were personalized based on their\npast behavior and preferences.\n\nYou can\u2019t argue with that!\n\n##\n\nIf \u201csell, sell, sell\u201d is at the forefront of every piece of email marketing\nyou send out, your audience is quickly going to lose interest.\n\nInstead, a key way to set yourself apart from the competition is to tell\nstories with your emails, integrating your products or services within these\nwhen they are relevant to the insight you are giving.\n\nThe best way to get through to people is to paint a picture they can\u2019t help\nbut imagine themselves in. Use sensory description and personal stories to\nimmediately get them hooked.\n\nStorytelling with your emails not only makes them more memorable but also\nestablishes your business as a more credible source of travel advice.\n\nWriting content that is personal, descriptive, genuinely interesting, and\nengaging means your readers are far more likely to hang around, trust the\ninformation you give them, and think of you when they start planning a\nholiday.\n\nMany of us daydream about travel, and your emails should make the most of\nthis.\n\nImagine you\u2019ve got two different emails in your inbox. Both are from travel\nbusinesses that focus on holidays in Italy, and both contain content designed\nto inspire you to book your next trip with them.\n\nThe first email opens with a banner outlining the company\u2019s current deals on\nvisiting Italy\u2019s major cities. There\u2019s a greeting, some appealing photos of\nplaces like the Colosseum and Rialto Bridge, and a well-written (if a little\nbland) short article offering five tips for getting the most out of visiting\nRome, Venice, and Florence. The email closes with a message informing you that\nthe exclusive deals won\u2019t last long and that you should book your next trip\ntoday.\n\nThe second email opens with a greeting from Francesca, an Italian travel\nexpert who is currently living in Tuscany. She describes what it is that made\nher fall in love with Italy in the first place, the different towns and cities\nthat she has stayed in, and even the view of the Tuscan hills surrounding her\nas she writes.\n\nFrancesca goes on to give unique, thoughtful recommendations on some of the\nbest places to visit in Italy in the coming months, drawing on her own\nexperiences. A couple of links to the holiday packages her company offers are\nintegrated into the text, but nothing too \u2018in-your-face\u2019.\n\nAt the end of the email, there are a few more links to other pieces of content\nFrancesca has written. Because you have previously engaged with content that\nfocuses on family travel and locations suitable for young children, the\nrecommendations are personalized to suit these interests.\n\nWhich one of these emails would you most likely read, enjoy and engage with?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the next great novelist to write compelling emails that\ntell a story. In fact, one of the easiest ways to produce email content like\nthe piece described above is to use your staff or partners as the narrators in\nyour email, describing their experiences and putting faces to the name of your\ncompany.\n\nAn easy formula to follow is this. Set the scene, show credibility, offer\nadvice, and then slide in a very subtle sell if it feels relevant.\n\nFocus on adding value to the reader\u2019s inbox and gaining their attention and\ntrust, instead of trying to sell your product or service every time.\n\nThe more emails you write and the more customer data you gather, the better\nidea you\u2019ll get of what kind of storytelling is the most effective. As time\ngoes on, you can hone your approach and produce outstanding content every\nsingle time.\n\nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\n\n##\n\nData for a study by Econsultancy suggests that 66% of travelers watch videos\nof a destination while researching where to travel.\n\nResearch on the effect of video marketing also suggests that businesses who\nuse video marketing get up to 66% more leads than their competitors who go\nwithout.\n\nWith this in mind, including videos within your email marketing is a fantastic\nway to improve reader engagement and ignite a sense of wanderlust in your\naudience.\n\nWhilst well-crafted text that tells a story is essential in successful emails,\nvideo is the ultimate way to paint a picture for your reader and capture their\nattention and imagination in a new way. It\u2019s an easy method of splitting up\nchunks of text, is more effective than just using photographs, and can help to\nexplain detailed topics in a fast and simple format.\n\nVideo is one of the most versatile forms of content out there and is a\nfantastic way to maximize what you get out of the content you create. A\nsingle, 2-3 minute video can be split up into multiple different sections to\nuse in a variety of different emails, as well as acting as a trailer for a\nlong video available somewhere on your website.\n\nNot only that, but it\u2019s a great way to \u201chumanize\u201d your content.\n\nI talked above about storytelling by using real people to narrate your emails,\nand adding videos only furthers the effect of this. Your audience is much more\nlikely to trust you if they\u2019ve seen clips of people in your business\ndescribing experiences, giving advice, and offering valuable insights.\n\nVideo content is a huge part of effective marketing. Implement it in your\nemail strategy and the results will speak for themselves.\n\n##\n\nThe final piece of advice for effective email marketing is to nurture your\naudience. Above everything else, what is going to increase customer\nsatisfaction, drive repeat business and establish a positive brand image is\nthrough producing content that is relevant, valuable, and unique.\n\nSegmentation has been mentioned a lot in this article, but it\u2019s the key to\ndelivering email content that leads to success.\n\nIf you\u2019re not giving your readers exactly what they want, they\u2019re going to\nunsubscribe to your mailing list. The best way to establish what they want is\nby creating groups with different interests and goals, targeting each of these\nwith personalized content.\n\nEach of your customer groups can be individually nurtured through your email\ncontent, building their trust and establishing yourself as someone whose\ncontent they really want to read. This relationship requires time and\ninvestment, but when your audience decides to book a holiday, you\u2019ll be the\ncompany they think of first.\n\n##\n\nAt the end of the day, your emails are only as good as the data you collect\naround them. It doesn\u2019t matter how incredible your writing is or how valuable\nyour videos are if you\u2019re not analyzing their success and targeting the areas\nwhere your customers are engaging.\n\nHowever, once you\u2019ve established this process, you\u2019ll find that email\nmarketing is one of the most rewarding and effective methods of marketing.\nIt\u2019s cost-effective, yields immediate effects, and has a huge reach that can\nreally help to grow your customer base.\n\nIt\u2019s also somewhere that you are in control and not reliant on third-party\nplatforms. Algorithm changes in Google or updates to Facebook\u2019s newsfeed can\nchange your visibility overnight, but harnessing those channels into an email\nlist gives you a resource that you\u2019re in charge of and which can\u2019t disappear\novernight.\n\nAs a travel company, your job is transporting your readers to new places, both\nwith your trips and with your content. Email marketing offers the perfect\nformat for inspiration, advice, and building brand affinity, and the best news\nis, anyone can do it.\n\n**More Email Marketing Resources:**\n\n  * 4 Ideas to Combine Email Marketing & SEO for Stellar Results\n  * 5 Ways Email Marketing Can Help Your SEO Efforts\n  * New Report Reveals the 3 Trends Shaping Email Marketing in 2020\n\n* * *\n\n**_Image Credits_**\n\n_Screenshots and Featured Image: Created and taken by author, March 2021_\n\nCategory Content Digital Experience\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead Full Bio\n\nVIP CONTRIBUTOR Tom McLoughlin  Director at SEO Travel\n\nTom Mcloughlin is the founder of SEO Travel, a specialist travel marketing\ncompany.
