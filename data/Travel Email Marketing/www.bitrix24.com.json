Offering aspirational content on travel is a far stretch from\ntrying to interest people in fixing pipes, so you can really get creative.\n\nHowever, creativity can only get you so far. Without solid, data-driven\nstrategies, you\u2019ll fire emails out into the ether never to be seen by anyone,\nmuch less clicked on. However, by directing your creativity through tools, you\ncan streamline your internal processes and make your customer experience not\njust easy, but a pleasure.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll be running through 7 email marketing strategies for travel\nagencies that will help you build strong relationships and increase sales.\n\n##  \n\n## FAQs\n\n  \n\n### What are travel email examples?\n\nTypical travel agency email to client examples are:  \n\n  * Welcome emails \n  * Newsletters \n  * Thank you emails \n  * Special offers \n  * Confirmation emails \n  * Notifications and updates \n  * Happy birthday emails\n\n### What are travel agent email ideas?\n\nSome ideas that support email marketing strategies for travel agencies\ninclude:  \n\n  * Do your market research \n  * Give your customers what they love\n  * Suggest destinations based on data\n  * Add testimonials from happy customers\n  * Offer incentives to slow movers\n\n### What are the best email marketing strategies for travel agencies?\n\nThe best email tips for travel agencies include:  \n\n  * Collate data on consumer behavior\n  * Personalize your communications\n  * Automate emails for fast response times\n  * Offer engaging guides and tips \u2014 not just sales\n  * Take advantage of engaging images\n  * Design mobile-first emails\n\n##  \n\n## 1\\. CRM: The bedrock of your email marketing\n\nThe first strategy on our list is to acquire and populate a super customer\nrelationship management (CRM) system. This is a database where you store all\nthe records of all your clients, from first and last name to email address,\ntelephone number, and social media handles.\n\nAll email marketing strategies for travel agencies will advise you to populate\nyour CRM with as much detail as possible. You can use sign up forms on your\nwebsite and social media to get the basics, and use follow-up forms to get a\ndeeper understanding of their interests. If you find yourself struggling for\ncustomers, incentivize leads with special offers to join your newsletter.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your leads, all their interactions will be saved within the\nsystem. This means that every holiday booked, every link clicked, and every\ninteraction contributes to creating a clearer picture of every client.\n\nEmail marketing in the travel industry also relies heavily on segregating your\ncustomer database into smaller demographics. Travel email examples couples\nover 60 may focus more on cruises and romantic getaways, while those for young\nsingles may feature content on beach breaks and party cities. Each lead can be\nput into multiple different lists based on their dream destinations,\nnationality, age bracket, and much more.\n\nOne of our top tips for travel email marketing is to sort your customers as\nthey enter your database, rather than manually sorting them into groups at a\nlater date. With your CRM set up correctly, all incoming leads can be\nautomatically split into relevant mailing lists so you can concentrate on\ncreating those enticing messages.\n\n##  \n\n## 2\\. Get personal with your content\n\nOne of the top email marketing strategies for travel agencies is to add a\npersonal touch to your messages. It is well known that emails that are\ndirected at specific targets, rather than thrown out to everybody on your\nlist, perform far better. Furthermore, if your users feel your content isn\u2019t\nrelevant to them, they\u2019re likely to see emails as junk and unsubscribe.\n\nA few easy ways to personalize emails:\n\n  * Include first name in subject and body \n\n  * Sending emails based on interest \n\n  * Waking up dormant leads with special offers \n\nSo now, you can create four to five variations on a monthly newsletter, with\nsome content overlapping, and other sections specific to each mailing list.\nInclude a personalization tag to include each recipient\u2019s name and you\u2019re\nready to launch your emails.\n\nAs they\u2019re personal, avoid overly corporate speech. A travel agency email to\nclient example subject could be \u201cMy top tips for travel in September\u201d.\nCreating and curating a connection with your customers builds trust over time\nand sets you apart from every other company\u2019s efforts. Therefore, send\nquality, personalized content often, and you\u2019ll keep the fire burning.\n\nBut it\u2019s not quite that easy! Even the best email marketing strategies for\ntravel agencies forget this one simple trick: Make sure your emails comply\nwith all local privacy legislation. Rules change depending on the country, but\nrespecting unsubscriptions and relying only on information voluntarily\nprovided are two big areas to work on.\n\nCompliance with personalization will also help your emails arrive safely at\ntheir destination (no pun intended). If you tick all the right boxes, you\u2019ll\navoid landing in the spam folder and being missed altogether.\n\n##  \n\n## 3\\. Use automations to trigger emails\n\nWhile your newsletters should include fresh, exciting content every month,\nemail marketing in the travel industry also requires standardized emails that\nwork by themselves behind the scenes so you can spend more time on the\ncreative side.\n\nEmails that are ideal for automation include:\n\n  * Welcome emails \n\n  * Thank you emails \n\n  * Confirmations \n\n  * Reminders \n\n  * Alerts \n\n  * Happy birthday emails \n\n  * Drip-fed promotional campaigns \n\nTrigger emails are a life-saver for busy people. You simply set up an event as\nyour trigger, and when it is met, your CRM sends out a pre-written\npersonalized email. For example, you can drip feed reminders of a campaign\nevery two days. Set them up in a customer journey workflow to relieve stress\non your team and keep your customers engaged.\n\nConfirmation emails are among the most common triggered travel agency email\nexamples. You only need a brief message, such as \u201cHi, Sarah, here is your\nconfirmation for booking number 0800896.\u201d All of the variable details, such as\nthe name and booking number, are automatically lifted from your CRM to\npopulate your email and before she knows it, Sarah has got her confirmation.\n\nThese days, the general public expects trigger emails as an assurance that\neverything is going to plan. Think of it like a physical ticket. Once your\ncustomer has their confirmation, they can rest easy until their holiday\napproaches.\n\nBut triggers can come in all shapes and sizes. You can monitor user\ninteraction with emails, and give them a nudge if you feel you\u2019re losing them.\nAutomate a message to go out after six months of no clicks, and offer them a\nspecial discount to convince them to get back in the game.\n\n##  \n\n* * *\n\n####\n\n#### Powerful Email Marketing Software\n\nReplace all your current SaaS solutions with all in one CRM and marketing\nautomation software.

Channel your content marketing\n\nContent is one of the most important email marketing strategies for travel\nagencies as it provides that inspirational backdrop that sparks customers into\naction. Email marketing for tourism relies more heavily than others on solid\ncontent as the costs involved in travel are much more than clothes, for\nexample.\n\nThe kind of content marketing that has been proven to work includes:\n\n  * City guides \n\n  * Tips on different types of travel \n\n  * Top places to eat listicles \n\n  * Things to do per month \n\nRather than travel agent email ideas that fill a message with an entire\narticle, consider writing a teaser that links to a longer article on your blog\nor videos and photo albums on social media. This is ideal for newsletters,\nwhere you want to include multiple articles or interesting features, but don\u2019t\nwant to send a 5000-word email.\n\nThe copy within your email should therefore be short and snappy. Travel agency\nemail examples that link to longer content could include lines like \u201cWhat\u2019s\nNew York been hiding all these years? Find out here.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s really hard to get people to act without giving them a call to\naction (CTA). Your CTA can direct your users to anything you want, whether\nit\u2019s a piece of content or a downloadable PDF that requires users to fill in a\nsurvey on their interests. With a powerful CRM combined with email marketing\nautomation, you can gather data on how well your emails are performing, and\nrun A/B tests to improve your approach.\n\n##  \n\n## 5\\. Go above and beyond slick text\n\nSure, your copy should be attractive, informal, and inspiring, but you can\nstill do much better. Email marketing strategies for travel agencies can take\nadvantage of mouth-watering imagery and videos. With no words at all, you can\ncreate a sense of adventure and get people desperate for a trip to a paradise\nbeach.\n\nMore than any other industry, images and video of travel can attract the eye.\nThis can be your secret weapon in grabbing your reader\u2019s attention and getting\nbookings. Just like with other areas of email marketing strategies for travel\nagencies, you can run tests on your emails to find out which images gain\nclicks. Sure, you could spend time working on A/B tests, but why not gauge\nwhat works by checking out your Instagram page?\n\nMake sure any images you embed are of the highest quality \u2014 anything less\ngives a \u201ccheap\u201d feeling. However, embedded videos can often slow your\ndownloading speed, so it\u2019s best to link to social media and leave a thumbnail\nas a teaser. A snippet of text underneath gives context and meaning to your\ncontent, and you\u2019re ready to go.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just enticing destinations you should be decorating your emails\nwith. Like in any other industry, travel email marketing can benefit hugely\nfrom branding that is clear, but that doesn\u2019t distract from the message.\nDesign all your emails to follow the same theme \u2014 whether they\u2019re automated\ntrigger emails or personal correspondence with your customers. It\u2019s all part\nof building trust with your clients and is one of the easiest email tips for\ntravel agencies we can offer.\n\n##  \n\n## 6\\. Make your emails mobile-friendly\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of mobile responsiveness yet, you must have been living\nunder a rock (or on a desert island). You\u2019ve probably already been working on\na mobile responsive website and booking process, but designing emails for\nsmartphones needs the same treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most important email marketing strategies for travel agencies,\nas a majority of users in the travel industry are turning to their phones for\nbrowsing, booking, and much more. For example, when you\u2019re coming up to the\nsecurity desk at an airport, the last thing you want is a confirmation email\nthat won\u2019t load properly.\n\nYour first strategy should therefore be to make all your emails compatible for\nmobile. A mobile-first mentality pushes you to craft dynamic messages that\nincrease your click-through-rate, rather than pedestrian, text-filled\nexplanations. Make sure to analyze how fast your animations and images load,\nand remember that not all phones respond the same.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just designing. Your CRM will tell you when your customers are\ntraveling (hint: it\u2019s between the start date and end date of their journey).\nThis is a perfect opportunity to send little extras during their trip. For\nexample, you could fire over an email with codes for city tours or authentic\nexperiences. They simply have to scan the code and get an unexpected, but very\npleasant, surprise.\n\n##  \n\n## 7\\. Get started with the right tools!\n\nGreat! You\u2019ve got a bunch of email marketing strategies for travel agencies,\nbut how are you going to put them into practice?\n\nSure, you could download a CRM to store your contacts and an email designer to\ngo with your website builder, communications center, and everything else you\nneed.
