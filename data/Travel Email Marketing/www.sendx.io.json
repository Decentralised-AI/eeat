In 2019, the\nAmerican travel and tourism industry alone contributed around 580.7 billion US\ndollars to the global economy. But with the advent of the pandemic, the sector\nwitnessed a significant downturn.\n\nNow, as the economy opens up, and with people accepting the _new normal,_ it\ncould finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n_Source:_ _statista_\n\nAs marketers plan for the upcoming strategy, they should never forget the\nemail campaign is the best to drive growth.\n\nAs stated by David Newman, a thought-leader in specialized marketing:\n\n\u201cEmail has an ability many channels don\u2019t: creating valuable, personal\ntouches- at scale.\u201d\n\nThis channel is not only popular in the USA but also in Europe. With the\ngovernment enforcing the GDPR regulation that safeguards the private\ninformation of European citizens, email marketers need to be more professional\nwhile interacting with their customers.\n\nSo, explore the best and effective travel email marketing strategies for your\norganization. We have some of them to incorporate in your process:\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n  * Top Travel and Tourism Email Marketing Tactics to Drive Growth\n  * Conclusion\n\n##  \nTop Travel and Tourism Email Marketing Tactics to Drive Growth\n\n###  \n1\\. Designing creative emails\n\n  \nLook for the creative ideas while designing travel-marketing emails.\n\n_Source:_ emailvendorselection.com\n\nAn eye-catching visual is all that makes the difference. Travel Hacker emails\nshow the best way, where the marketer could collage all the popular\ndestinations in one email. Along with that, they segregated it on, \u201cwallet\nfriendly,\u201d \u201ctop beach,\u201d and \u201ctop new year destinations.\u201d\n\nThis would meet the needs of all travelers.\n\n### 2\\. Building an email list\n\n  \nA right email list could make things easy for you. If you are rebooting your\nprocess after a long break, it is time to build a fresh email list.  Adopt\nvarious techniques such as including a pop-up in the website, creating more\nlanding pages, including the right CTA, among others.\n\n**Pop-ups:** Let\u2019s understand the fact, visitors have less attention span. So,\nwhen they visit your website, you should have the pop-up grabbing their\nattention. In this, you can ask the email address, name, and other necessary\ndetails. The tactic could pull the prospects really interested in your\nservice.\n\n**CTA:** A personalized CTA on every landing page is an efficient tactic to\npull the relevant prospects visiting your website. For example, if a unique\nvisitor checks your blog on \u201cselecting the best mailing service provider,\u201d\nthen you should grab their relevant information at the earliest. This would be\nthe addition of fresh information into your email list.\n\n### 3\\. Including mesmerizing videos\n\n  \n66% of travelers watch videos before finalizing the destination.\n\nThe statistics should not surprise you!!!\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t they do so?\n\nAfter all, the leisure travelers look for unique and memorable experiences. Be\nit the serene beauty, or the authentic scrumptious food of a faraway place.\nThey want the instant escape to rejuvenate themselves. So, as a marketer, if\nyou add the videos that grab their attention, it would be a win-win scenario\nfor both of you.\n\nEmbedding a video in the emails is all made easy with the email marketing\nsoftware like SendX. The step-by-step guide helps users to send the best\nvideos to the recipients.\n\n### 4\\. Email automation\n\n  \nAutomated emails could make the task easier for marketers in the travel and\ntourism industry. When you send an instant email to the recipient, they get\nthe good vibes. They start trusting your service and eagerly wait for your\nupcoming email.\n\nSource: uplandsoftware.com\n\nFor example, after the customer books for the destination, you can send a\nfollow-up email just before 14 days, 7 days, and so on. You can also share\nuseful information such as the best attractions and the hotels in the town.\nThis could bring the customer closer to your brand.\n\nYou can try all the innovative tactics while designing the email and later\nautomate it.\n\n### 5\\. Personalizing your email campaign\n\n  \nPersonalization would never lose its sheen. Put yourself in the customer\u2019s\nshoes and think like a traveler.\n\nWould you read the email where the destination does not match your\npreferences?\n\nFor example, you hate places where the weather is hot and humid while the\nmarketer sends tropical countries destinations. It indeed would not work!!!\n\nEvery email marketer in the travel industry should find their customer\u2019s\npreferences before reaching out to them; otherwise, it would be an utter\nfailure.\n\n### 6\\. Asking about the experience\n\n  \nAs competition becomes stiff, organizations should stand out by asking their\ncustomer\u2019s experience via email. The process significantly improves the\nrelationship with the customer.\n\nAirbnb, the American vacation rental marketplace, offers a unique tourism\nexperience, and the company found with this tactic, they could understand\ntheir customer better.\n\nSource: birdeye.com\n\nCustomers were free to share their experiences. It was observed, the brand\nreceived many positive feedbacks.\n\n### 7\\. Enticing user-generated content\n\n  \nUser-generated content is gradually becoming the lifeline of marketing as it\nincreases the open rate. Customers are more willing to see the experience of\ntheir fellow travelers. The primary reason being they value authentic content\nmore than the promotional ones by brands.\n\nEvery marketer should look into this and develop content aligned with the\ninterest of the recipients.\n\n### 8\\. Demographic segmentation\n\n  \nSegmenting the audience with respect to preferences, interests are very common\nin an email strategy, but have you tried segmenting based on the demographics?\n\nYes, segmenting the audience based on demographics really works.\n\nDemographics that include the age-group should also be considered while\nsending emails, as youngsters prefer mostly adventurous places, compared to\nelderly people.\n\n### 9\\. Conveying all the information in one go\n\n  \nMost of the recipients do not have the time to read the entire email. In such\ncases, if you collect and collage all the information in a single design, then\nthey would find it exciting.\n\nSource: reallygoodemails.com\n\nThis example shows how to include all the relevant elements in the email\ncontent. You can find the information related to accommodations, destinations,\ndining, activities, all in a single email.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it would motivate the customer to take the right action?\n\n### 10\\. Thank You email\n\n  \nThanking your customers implies you value them significantly.\n\nEvery customer loves that feeling. They are automatically drawn towards your\nbrand.\n\nSo, never forget to thank them.\n\nThe example here shows the travel company greeting the customer and thanking\nthem with the line,\u201d we are happy to have you part\u2026.\u201d\n\nSend thank you emails\n\n### 11\\. Subject lines\n\n  \nA great subject line is the hero of the entire email content. It flashes the\nessence of the entire email in one go. Some of the best subject lines in the\nemail could be \u201c50% off in the castaways from\u2026,\u201d \u201cstylish stays at your\nfavorite locations,\u201d \u201cpick an island, any island.\u201d\n\nDisplaying discounts in the subject line would attract all the customers.\nAlso, the statements such as \u201cstylish stays\u2026\u201d convey that the customer could\nhave a comfortable stay at their favorite location. Secret Escapes, Thomas\nCook, and the Expedia team show how to attract customers with some of the best\nsubject lines.\n\nSource: econsultancy.com\n\n### 12\\. Newsletters to drive campaign\n\n  \nSending newsletters at regular intervals could boost your email marketing\ncampaign. These email campaigns nurture the customer and keep your brand on\ntop of their minds.\n\nYou can design the best newsletter by including the refreshing pictures of the\ncountryside or cities.\n\nThe Crystal Cruise, the American cruise line, designed the newsletter for its\nluxury travel customers. It showcased travelers enjoying the services and\nhaving a good time, far away from the busy city life.\n\nSource: blog.joomag.com\n\nBesides that, the brand included the content that conveys more information\nabout their service.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n  \nEmail marketing strategy in travel and tourism companies needs a major\nfacelift. As customers increasingly look for the secure destinations,\nmarketers should also look into this aspect. They have to develop emails that\nshowcase the destination as adventurous but also safe to explore.\n\nThe tactics in the blog are some of the effective ones, and you could\nimplement the same to witness exponential results, just by using an email\nmarketing software like SendX (for a free 14-day trial, no credit card\nrequired)!!!\n\nAuthor: Emily Johnson  |  \n\n  \n\nEmily Johnson is a marketing consultant with 10 years of experience.\nCurrently, she heads the marketing department at Blue Mail Media, a renowned\nB2B data solution company based out of Austin, Texas.\n\n  \n\nRead more posts by this author.\n\n0 Comments\n\n| |\n\n\u00d7  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nsearch|\n\n  \n  \nCustom Search\n\n|\n\nSort by:\n\nRelevance\n\nRelevance\n\nDate  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n## 7 Tips to Skyrocket Your Email Campaign like an Email Marketing Expert\n\n## Cyber Monday SaaS Deals: Irresistible SaaS Offers (List For 2023)\n\nSendX Blog - Email Marketing & Growth\n\n\u2014\n\n12 Travel and Tourism Email Marketing Tips To Drive Business Growth\n\nTry SendX for free\n\nStart Free Trial\n\n### Subscribe to the SendX Blog\n\nNotification Frequency\n\nWeekly updates on email marketing & growth.\n\n  *     * Get started\n      * Try SendX For Free\n      * Pricing\n      * Downloads\n      * Book a Demo\n      * WordPress Plugin\n      * JS API\n      * SendX Affiliate Program\n    * Company\n      * About Us\n      * Terms & Conditions\n      * Privacy Policy\n      * b2b-marketing-zone\n    * Contact Us\n      * 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes,\n      * Delaware 19958, USA\n      * \u200d\n      * Support: support@sendx.io\n      * Phone: +1 (720) 782-5271\n  *     * Product Features\n      * Send Email Newsletters\n      * Send Bulk Emails\n      * Email Autoresponder\n      * Send Emails via Amazon SES\n      * Email Campaigns\n      * Embedded Sign Up Forms\n      * Email Drip Sequence\n      * Email Pop Up Forms\n      * Email Automation\n      * WYSIWYG Email Editor\n      * Integrations\n      * ESP Integrations\n      * All Key Features\n  *     * Use Cases\n      * Email Marketing for Non-Profits & Charities\n      * Email Marketing for Bloggers\n      * Email Marketing for Schools\n      * Email Marketing for Universities\n      * Email Marketing for Authors\n      * Email Marketing for Real Estate\n      * Email Marketing for Accounting & Finance\n      * Email Marketing for Online Gambling\n      * Email Marketing for Crypto & Blockchain\n      * Email Marketing for Affiliate Marketers\n      * All Use Cases by Verticals\n  *     * Other Resources\n      * Email Marketing Help Center\n      * Email Marketing Blog\n      * Email Marketing Resources\n      * Email Deliverability Resources\n      * Free Email Template Resources\n    * Compare\n      * Mailchimp Alternatives\n      * All Comparisons\n      * Mailchimp vs SendX\n      * Aweber vs SendX\n      * Constant Contact vs SendX\n      * ConvertKit vs SendX\n      * Mailerlite vs SendX\n      * Drip vs SendX\n      * Sendy vs SendX\n      * Klaviyo vs SendX\n      * GetResponse vs SendX\n      * ActiveCampaign vs SendX\n\n|  \n---|---\n\n",
