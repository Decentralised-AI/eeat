People are super picky\n(read: sensitive) about their travel experiences.  \n\nBut we\u2019re here as your knight in shining armor; because below, we have\nmentioned the 10 necessary tips to create a travel email marketing campaign\nthat is highly likely to convince your subscribers.\n\n###  **1\\. Think of campaign ideas that customers will love**\n\nFirst things first, select a campaign idea.  \n\nIf your mind feels like a blank slate, look at the campaign ideas mentioned\nbelow. These can help you create high-performing travel emails.\n\n  *  **Add testimonials to woo your subscribers**\n\nWant to know the power of testimonials?  \n\nAccording to research, **93%** of consumers say that online reviews influence\ntheir purchase decisions. So, create and send emails that have testimonials\nfrom happy clients. These can be in the form of videos, pictures, and/or\nwritten reviews.  \n\nBy doing so, you increase your reader\u2019s confidence in your brand, which\nfurther motivates them to travel with you.\n\n  *  **Suggest them travel destinations**\n\nYour suggestion should vary according to the time of the year. Give them\nsuggestions to visit places during the high, low, and shoulder season.  \n\nSomething that goes like; Hey! Guess what? Paris - the city of love, has its\narms open for you with a 20% discount on return tickets.  \n\nYou can also suggest which place is more economical or safe to visit during\nspecific times of the year.\n\n  *  **Give them an incentive  **\n\nOne of the greatest attractions for a tourist to travel with agencies is their\nincentives or discounts on travel destinations.  \n\nYou can offer free or discounted adventure park tickets, or free food at a\nparticular restaurant.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible for someone to turn down such an opportunity.\n\n  *  **Understand their interests through questionnaires  **\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to entertain your subscribers or send them personalized\nemails until you understand their interests, would you?  \n\nSo, here\u2019s what you can do; send your subscribers questionnaires or review\nforms to collect information from them. This will skyrocket the engagement\nrate of your emails and help you nurture relationships with them.\n\n  *  **Suggest limited time offers  **\n\nThey say, \u201cWithout a sense of urgency, desire loses its value.\u201d So, let\u2019s cash\non people\u2019s desire to avail limited time offers.  \n\nSend them emails with limited-time offers and see how impulsively they rush to\ntravel with you. We\u2019ll discuss the importance of such email designs later in\nthis article but for now, just shortlist this idea for your travel email\nmarketing campaign.\n\n###  **2\\. Be cautious about your subscriber list**\n\nCreating a subscriber list is similar to making friends; make sure you\nshortlist the most reliable ones.  \n\nYou can create your subscriber list by placing a sign-up option at a visible\nand prominent place on your website. You can also use social media posts to\ncollect subscribers\u2019 email addresses.  \n\nApart from this, you can also collect email addresses in person from people\nwho make reservations at the resort that your company collaborates with.  \n\nLastly, you can use double opt-in forms for careful screening of your\nsubscriber list.\n\n###  **3\\. Segment and personalize your emails  **\n\nWe can't emphasize enough the significance of both of these practices.  \n\nSegment your subscriber list based on criteria like age, customer\u2019s interests,\nor your subscriber\u2019s travel history. This allows you to send personalized\nemails conveniently.  \n\nSpeaking of which, you can personalize your emails in different ways, such as\nthrough email subject lines, by adding names with the help of merge tags, or\nby sending emails that are specially designed for a specific segment of\nsubscribers.  \n\nResearch says segmented emails are responsible for **** a ******14.31%**\nhigher open rate than non-segmented campaigns. Besides this, both segmentation\nand personalization are responsible for creating a better user experience.\n\n###  **4\\. Convince them with written content**\n\nYour **email copy** **** is the voice of your brand. Not to add pressure on\nyou, but it has the tendency to make or break your deal.  \n\nKeep it as personal and conversational as possible. It makes your reader feel\nthat you are talking to them exclusively, which keeps them interested in your\nmessage.  \n\nMoreover, using industry jargon is a big no-no because how will people respond\nto your message if they don\u2019t even understand it? So, use comprehensive and\npersonalized language in your travel emails to connect with your audience.\n\n###  **5\\. Create visually appealing travel email designs  **\n\nDid you know that **90%** of the information received by the brain is visual?  \n\nYep, that\u2019s right. So if you want your brand\u2019s identity imprinted in your\nsubscriber\u2019s brain or wish to deliver your message more effectively, then you\nneed to give some serious attention to your **email design**.  \n\nYou can do this in many ways;\n\n  *  **Wisely add images**\n\nAs a travel company, the easiest way to lure your subscribers to travel with\nyou is by embedding breathtaking images of travel destinations. But if\noverdone, it can backfire.  \n\nThere are 2 important things to be careful about when you're **embedding\nimages in emails**. First, use only high-quality images, and second, always\nadd text along with the image.  \n\nAlso, be wise in the image selection. It\u2019s your embedded image that is most\nlikely to turn your subscriber\u2019s response positive.\n\n  *  **Cleverly select a color scheme**\n\nGo for a color scheme that will complement your brand, your message, and the\n**interactive elements** embedded in your emails. It\u2019s preferable to use color\ncontrasts as it can attract your customers\u2019 attention.\n\n  *  **Necessarily opt for responsiveness  **\n\nThere\u2019s one element or design feature that you must never compromise on, and\nthat\u2019s your email design\u2019s responsiveness.  \n\nResearch says, **51%** of emails are opened on mobile. So, ensure that the\ndesigns you select are responsive on all kinds of devices.\n\n  *  **Carefully insert countdown timers**\n\nWell, it\u2019s the holiday season, and everyone\u2019s planning to travel. It\u2019s the\nideal time to use the FOMO element in your emails.  \n\nTo gear up the urgency factor in your emails, add countdown timers. If you\nfind yourself puzzled about doing so, here\u2019s a glimpse of **Unlayer** ****\nallowing you to embed countdown timers in your emails with great ease.\n\n  *  **Sensibly create and place CTA buttons**\n\nWhat if your subscriber agreed to travel with you but kept scratching their\nhead about what action to take next? Yep, let\u2019s avoid that.  \n\nAdd prominent, well-designed, nicely labeled, and properly placed ******call-\nto-action buttons in emails** **.** This allows the readers to take further\naction more easily and increases the clicks up to **371%** **** and\nconversions up to 1617%.\n\n###  **6\\. Give them reasons to choose you**\n\n\u200b\u200bThe bitter truth is that you\u2019re not the only one who wants your subscribers\nto travel with them.  \n\nSo you\u2019ve got to earn those stripes by showing them what you have is the best.\nFor instance, create a humorous email. Something like, \u201cWe heard you settled\nfor less. So we\u2019re here to help you reconsider and choose the best.\u201d  \n\nYou can also mention how your travel package is better than anyone else in the\nmarket. It could be either because of the lower prices or better travel\ndestinations and accommodations, etc.\n\n###  **7\\. Send trigger emails  **\n\nResearch says **trigger emails** result in 24 times more revenue per send as\ncompared to other emails.  \n\nWell, this statistic alone should be enough to convince you. You can send\ntrigger emails based on your subscriber\u2019s actions or behaviors. This will\nincrease their interest in your email and also boost click and conversion\nrates.  \n\nFor instance, send your user a welcome email after they sign up. This can\ninclude special deals and discounts (as mentioned earlier).  \n\nIf they buy your service, then send them a transactional or confirmation\nemail. If they complete a trip with you, send them a thank you or feedback\nemail.  \n\nTake a look at the automation flow chart below to understand this better.\n\n###  **8\\. Use software that can boost your email\u2019s performance  **\n\nYou must have heard people say, \u201cWork smart, not hard\u201d. Well, that\u2019s exactly\nwhat **email** **marketing software** offers you.  \n\nHere are the 3 most useful and reliable email marketing software that can help\nyou create the best travel emails.\n\n####  **Unlayer**\n\nUnlayer is a user-friendly drag and drop editor that helps you to create and\nmodify professional-looking emails.
