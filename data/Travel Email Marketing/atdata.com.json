The email\u2019s clean, modern look and feel matches that of the hotel\noptions Tablet offers. In addition, the email excels at incorporating clever\ncopywriting and stunning imagery-so stunning that it\u2019s worth clicking through\nto take a peek even if you\u2019re not in the market for a luxury hotel.\n\n* * *\n\n## 3\\. Sixt\n\nThis email from Sixt joins our lineup of great examples for how it delights\nand rewards its customers. Every email is full of personality, including this\none celebrating Cinco de Mayo with fun imagery and read-worthy copy.
