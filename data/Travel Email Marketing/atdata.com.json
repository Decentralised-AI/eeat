summer\nvacations your prospects have been dreaming about. While some people love the\nprocess of choosing a destination, the hotel and other aspects of a getaway,\nit can also feel like information overload-especially when the hopeful\ntraveler visits 38 travel sites, on average, before booking.\n\nFor marketers in the travel sector, email is an effective way to capitalize on\nconsumer travel plans. And with so many travel websites, hotel options and\ndestinations to choose from, businesses that specialize in travel and leisure\ncan leverage email to stay top of mind among busy consumers as they plan their\nmuch-needed vacations.\n\nHere are three examples of travel emails that do an incredible job engaging\nand entertaining wandering vacation shoppers:\n\n* * *\n\n## 1\\. Travel + Leisure\n\nWhile the important components of travel are usually the first things that\ncome to mind when planning a trip-like where to eat at your destination and\nhow much time to leave for airport security-there are other key factors that\ncan make or break our travel plans. Travel + Leisure\u2018s online destination for\ntravel tips, guides, news and information uses email marketing to share timely\nand interesting stories about some of the less conspicuous things one needs to\nconsider when traveling.\n\nIn the following clip from Travel + Leisure\u2019s email newsletter, readers\nreceive a digest of popular blog posts with helpful travel information, like\ntips for flying with young children. Subscribers are encouraged to read more\non the blog and further engage with the company\u2019s site.\n\n* * *\n\n## 2\\. Tablet Hotels\n\nWe love Tablet\u2018s approach to travel email marketing because it aligns so\nnicely with the brand\u2019s target audience: people who love luxury vacations and\nhotels. The email\u2019s clean, modern look and feel matches that of the hotel\noptions Tablet offers. In addition, the email excels at incorporating clever\ncopywriting and stunning imagery-so stunning that it\u2019s worth clicking through\nto take a peek even if you\u2019re not in the market for a luxury hotel.\n\n* * *\n\n## 3\\. Sixt\n\nThis email from Sixt joins our lineup of great examples for how it delights\nand rewards its customers. Every email is full of personality, including this\none celebrating Cinco de Mayo with fun imagery and read-worthy copy. Along\nwith offering a deal to rent a BMW or Mercedes-Benz, the email includes copy\nin both English and Spanish to incorporate some extra Cinco de Mayo flair.\n\nAll of these examples delight readers with useful information, compelling\ndesign or engaging personality that\u2019s targeted to their recipients.\nIncorporate these ideas into your email strategy, and you\u2019re well on your way\nto building a highly engaged audience.\n\n**An irresistible email marketing strategy starts with having valuable data\nabout your customers.
