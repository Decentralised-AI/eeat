You may\nonly need one email list for everyone, including potential new clients and\nolder clients alike. However, it\u2019s also smart to separate these lists out if\nyou decide to share alternative email marketing to each type of customer.\n\nFor example, you might have an email list for current and old clients who\nreceive emails about upcoming promotions, updates, etc. Then, you may have a\nseparate list for people who have reached out or shown interest in booking\nwith you. They could receive emails that are part of an email campaign to help\nget them into your sales funnel.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have many emails yet and need to begin building your list, below\nare a couple of ways to begin building your email list:\n\n#### Lead Magnets\n\nA lead magnet is one of the most popular ways to acquire email addresses for\nmarketers!

Below you will find different ideas to\nimplement for your email marketing strategy.\n\n**A Welcome Email**\n\nThis is especially important if you have an email signup form or lead magnet,\nconsider sharing a simple welcome email to introduce yourself and share links\nto connect on your social media and website. This is also a great place to\nshowcase your expertise and tell the reader how you can help them in planning\ntheir future trips.\n\nAccording to GetResponse, a welcome email gets an average of 82% open rate!\n\n**Promotions and Sales**\n\nOne of the great things with having an email marketing strategy in place is\nthat it\u2019s an easy way to share upcoming promotions and sales to your clients.\nYou can share supplier promotions and your own!\n\n**Business News and Announcements**\n\nBe sure to keep your email viewers in the loop with any new business\nannouncements that you might have or keep them up to date on what you\u2019re up to\nand what you\u2019re adding to your business. For example, if you attended a\nconference and learned about new suppliers to offer your client amazing\nexperiences, share this with them!\n\n**Curated Content of Industry News**\n\nYou\u2019re the expert and your clients look to you for travel industry updates and\nnews. Share an email linking to various articles that will keep them updated\nand if you specialize in particular destinations you can curate this news\nbased on where your clients typically travel to.\n\n**Blog Posts and Content You\u2019ve Created**\n\nIf you create content like blog articles on your website, you can always\npackage these articles up in an email for them to check out.\n\n**Invitation to Events You Are Hosting**\n\nIf you are hosting an upcoming live event in-person or online be sure to let\nyour audience know by sending them an email!\n\n**Relationship Building**\n\nConsider implementing emails that will help build a relationship with your\nemail list. You can send emails for important dates like birthdays,\nanniversaries, and even check-in emails 1 year after they took their last trip\nyou helped plan.\n\n**Email Campaigns**\n\nWe saved the best for last! Email campaigns are extremely effective and allow\nyou to curate a string of emails that can be automated once a new email\naddress is added to your database. An email campaign can consist of multiple\nemails that are strategically lined up for the subscriber to receive. Here\u2019s\nan example of a simple email campaign for new leads that come to you:\n\n_Email #1: Welcome Email  \n_ Introducing the new subscriber to your email and letting them know what to\nexpect and learn more about who you are and what you can provide to them.  \n  \n_Email #2: Travel Inspiration  \n_ Highlight the destinations and travel experiences you specialize in. You can\nshare it in photos and text or link it back to your website that they can\nfurther explore.  \n  \n _Email #3: Client Testimonies  \n_ You\u2019re the expert and you\u2019re good at your job so show them this! Share with\nthem reviews and testimonials of past clients and this might encourage them to\nbegin booking travel with you.  \n  \n_Email #4: Industry Updates  \n_ This can be an email that you update once a month but this is another great\nway to share your expertise so that they know they can come to you for any\ntravel-related questions.\n\nOf course, your email campaign can look different but these are just ideas to\nhelp get you started. You can schedule each email to go out once a week or\nmaybe the second email comes three days after the welcome email and the rest\ncome a week later. It\u2019s also helpful to check out the open rates and\nunsubscribe rates to adjust accordingly if needed.\n\n* * *\n\n## When Should I Send Emails?\n\nThis is one of the most popular questions when sending emails, you want them\nto be effective but you also don\u2019t want to overdo it sending them to press the\nunsubscribe button. Unfortunately, when researching through data of this you\nmight see different results which is why it\u2019s important to find what works\nbest for you.\n\nHowever, according to many resources, including Sleeknote, Tuesday and\nThursday are the best days. Typically, weekends should be avoided but there\nhas been data shown that for business-to-consumer emails, weekends actually do\nwell since consumers might be more likely to read their emails on the weekend\nduring more downtime.\n\nTiming is also important! According to optinmonster, 8 am and 4 pm seems to be\nthe best time to send emails.\n\nWe would encourage you to always reevaluate what is working and what is not\nfor your email list and adjust accordingly. Feel free to experiment with\ndifferent times and days as well!\n\n* * *\n\n\u00a9 2012 - 2020 TRAVEFY, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.  \nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy | Image Attribution Policy\n\n",
