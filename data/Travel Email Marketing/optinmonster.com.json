That\u2019s a question that travel marketers have to wrestle with\nevery day.\n\nTravel is one of the world\u2019s largest industries, contributing US$7.6 trillion\nto the world economy, according to Statista. Global tourism revenue in 2016\nwas US$1.26 trillion, and around 1.2 million people traveled internationally\nin 2016.\n\nWith a lot of competition, and a large potential market, it\u2019s essential to\nfind effective ways to reach new customers, retain existing ones, and make\nyour business stand out. One of the best ways to do that is with travel\nindustry email marketing.\n\nAs our email marketing statistics roundup shows, Statista says more than 90%\nof American adults use email. Email has an ROI of $38 for every dollar spent,\nwhich is better than the ROI for both direct mail and social media.\n\nThis guide will show how marketers and travelers view travel industry email\nmarketing. It\u2019ll look at the increasing importance of mobile, and will give\nsome email marketing tips and best practices for the travel industry.\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll know how to nail travel industry email marketing so that\nmore people use your travel business to book flights, reserve accommodation,\nrent cars, and do other travel-related tasks.\n\n### Benefits of Email Marketing for Travel Companies\n\nEmail marketing has a lot to offer the travel industry, and travel industry\nprofessionals know it. According to Mailchimp, travel email marketing has a\n20.69% open rate.\n\nThat\u2019s no doubt why 84% of brands use email marketing to help them retain\ncustomers.\n\nWith people starting to plan their trips 84 days ahead, according to Litmus,\nemail marketing helps woo customers while they\u2019re making their minds up, and\ncan even make people who weren\u2019t planning a trip decide to buy. That\u2019s a nice\nboost to the bottom line.\n\nOther benefits of travel email marketing include:\n\n  * Building brand loyalty among your existing customers.\n  * Attracting and retaining new customers.\n  * Letting small travel firms compete successfully for attention with larger ones.\n  * Getting your share of a large, vibrant market. In the US alone, travelers spend $31,400 a second, according to the USTA.\n\n### Smartphones: World\u2019s Favorite Travel Accessory\n\nThere\u2019s one major industry trend that affects how you\u2019ll implement your email\nmarketing strategy as a travel marketer: the rise of the smartphone.\n\nSmartphones have become a favorite travel accessory for 76% of people, says\nEye for Travel.\n\nAnd while they\u2019re on vacation, 85% of people use their phones to manage\ndifferent aspects of their trips, says WebPageFX.\n\nThose two trends add up to one important fact: **if you\u2019re marketing to the\ntravel industry today, you need a mobile marketing strategy**.\n\nPeople already use their phones to plan and book their trips, check in for\ntravel (64% of travelers use mobile check in), and to do more research while\ntraveling. That means that even while people are on their trips, there\u2019s a\nchance for travel industry marketers to reach them with compelling offers.\n\nBy 2018, more than a third of online travel bookings will come from mobile\ndevices. As with other industries, younger travelers use their phones even\nmore. More than half of people under 30 have booked hotel accommodation on\ntheir smartphones.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s no surprise that, according to Performance Horizon, travel\nbrands expect mobile to have an increasing influence on travel sales. And Eye\nfor Travel says 79% of travel industry executives see mobile marketing as one\nof the biggest opportunities in the industry.\n\n### The Mobile Travel Marketing Opportunity\n\nFor travel marketers, the mobile opportunity transcends national borders.\nThere are plenty of places where smartphone adoption\u2019s still on the rise. That\nmeans there\u2019s a chance to target both local and international travelers with a\nmobile campaign strategy.\n\nA report from Email Monks reveals that 69% of travel emails are opened on\nmobile devices. And Litmus says that 45% of people read emails from travel\nbrand emails on their phones.\n\nThe bottom line **: travelers are using mobile devices at every stage of their\njourneys**. Common activities include looking up hotel addresses, checking\nflight schedules, finding things to do at the destination, as well as taking\nphotos, using maps and finding attractions, activities and restaurants.\n\n### Travel Email Marketing and Mobile Conversions\n\nThere\u2019s just one caveat. Despite the rise of mobile, travel brands can\u2019t\nignore desktops. The reason: conversions. Although people research\ndestinations on mobile devices, for now, at least, more people complete travel\nsales on desktop computers.\n\nAccording to Eye for Travel, the desktop conversion rate is 2.7x higher than\nmobile. Their stats show a global conversion rate of 1.1% on mobile devices,\nand 3% on desktops. Booking.com has a higher mobile conversion rate at 2.6%,\nbut this still lags behind their desktop conversion rate of 6.5%.\n\nData from Smart Insights also supports this, showing that desktop conversions\nsignificantly outweigh those on mobile in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific\nregion.\n\nThis means that travel industry email marketing has to combine a mobile\nmarketing strategy for raising awareness and nurturing customers with a cross-\ndevice strategy for completing sales.\n\nNow let\u2019s get started with our travel industry email marketing tips. If you\u2019re\njust starting your travel business, you\u2019ll need to follow these six steps to\nbuild and manage your list. If you already have a list, skip to the best\npractices section below.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Email List\n\nThe first step is to choose an email service provider. When choosing email\nmarketing services for travel, check that there are plenty of travel-related\nemail templates. If you want to send seasonal or niche emails (such as for\nbeach or ski holidays, for example), you\u2019ll need those.\n\nIf you\u2019re using OptinMonster to collect emails (see the next step), you\u2019ll be\nable to change the optin form templates to match your travel business, as in\nthe example below.\n\nAnother important feature to look for when choosing your email service\nprovider is analytics, so you can see how your travel marketing campaigns are\ndoing.\n\n### Step 2: Collect Email Addresses\n\nAny successful travel business has to get repeat business from existing\ncustomers, and attract new travelers. Your email list is an essential part of\nthat process, so you need to keep it healthy.\n\nA good starting point is to use an optin form on your travel website to get\nemail newsletter signups. Make sure it\u2019s visible, no matter where people are\non your site.\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to offer an incentive for signing up, like a coupon. See the\nexample below:\n\nWhen people make enquiries or reservations, that\u2019s another good opportunity to\nask them to sign up for your list. Be warned, you have to ask permission. Just\nbecause they give permission for you to email travel details, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou can send anything you like.\n\nOther travel email marketing techniques include running a contest and asking\nfor an email address in exchange for an entry, or using an SMS \u201ctext to\nsubscribe\u201d campaign.\n\nWant to learn how to improve your SMS marketing strategy? Check out this\narticle on how to collect phone numbers on your website with popups.\n\nYou can also use OptinMonster to encourage people to sign up by targeting your\noptin offers. For example, you could deliver a lead magnet related to a\nparticular destination by using page-level targeting.\n\nYou can use onsite retargeting to make an offer to returning visitors. And you\ncan use exit intent to entice subscribers with a compelling offer just before\nthey leave your website.\n\nYou can also promote your email signup form on your social media sites. Here\u2019s\nhow you add an optin form to Facebook.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Email Content\n\nMany marketers struggle with content creation, so here are a few ideas for\nwhat to include in your travel marketing emails to get you started:\n\n  * Destination guides\n  * Travel tips and essential information\n  * Recommended destinations or trips\n  * Spotlights on attractions or events\n  * Information on holidays and festivals\n  * Reviews of both destinations and travel services\n  * Travel stories from other customers\n  * Polls and quizzes\n  * Cross-promotional offers (say, for hotels and car rental)\n\nYou can also include content from your blog (if you\u2019re not blogging yet,\nhere\u2019s how you get started), favorable press coverage, and insider views of\nyour travel company. And don\u2019t forget about deals, discounts and loyalty\noffers. Litmus says that\u2019s what most subscribers are looking for.\n\nAnd, since you\u2019ll be collecting customers\u2019 date of birth as part of any\nreservation, you can add a yearly birthday email into your email marketing\nplan, to make each customer feel truly special.\n\n### Step 4: Get the Timing Right\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what types of emails you want to send, figure out how\noften you will email your subscribers.\n\nAvoid the temptation to email too often. Our research shows that around a\nquarter of people say they get too much email from travel brands. And Campaign\nMonitor\u2018s data shows that almost 44% of people want businesses to send less\nemail.\n\nThe danger of sending too much email is that people will mark your emails as\nspam, unsubscribe or simply never open them. Those are all terrible options\nfrom a marketing viewpoint.\n\nThe latest email marketing benchmarks from GetResponse show that those who\nsend one newsletter a week get the highest open and click-through rate, at\n37.08% and 5.58% respectively, so that\u2019s a good starting point for your own\ntravel email marketing schedule.\n\nHowever, this is an average across all industries, so you\u2019ll need to work out\nthe ideal frequency for your own audience.\n\n### Step 5: Create an Email Marketing Calendar\n\nWhen you decide on email frequency, put your chosen emails into an email\nmarketing calendar, so you know exactly what to send on which dates, and can\nsee your email marketing plan at a glance. Hubspot has a useful email\nmarketing calendar template you can use.\n\nStart by putting in regular broadcasts, like emails that update customers\nabout new articles on your blog, then add any promotions for the main\nholidays. Include any announcements that you know about, such as changes\nwithin the company. Finally, fill in the blanks with some of the email types\nsuggested above.\n\n### Step 6: Send Your First Email\n\nThe first email you send subscribers is the most important, because it sets\nthe tone for your relationship with them. For most businesses, that\u2019s the\nwelcome email, which has a 60% open rate.\n\nA good welcome email will help you retain the subscribers you\u2019ve already\nattracted, and make them feel good about being on your email list. Keep your\nwelcome email short, relevant and valuable, and craft a killer email subject\nline to encourage people to open and read it.\n\nThis is a great place to ask subscribers to do one thing that gets them more\ninvolved with your company. It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated; just reading a\nblog post or sharing a piece of content begins the bonding process. You\u2019ll\nneed to nail the call to action to be effective, though.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at some practical strategies to improve your travel industry\nemail marketing.\n\n### 5 Tips for Successful Travel Email Marketing\n\n**1\\. Personalize your marketing**\n\nThere may be billions of travelers worldwide, but each one wants to feel\nspecial. According to SmartInsights, 83% of millennials are happy for travel\nbrands to track them so they can get personalized service. And 85% of\ntravelers prefer customized, rather than generic, itineraries.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to tailor your travel industry email marketing\npromotions to people\u2019s behavior and interests. The more relevant an offer is,\nthe more likely it is that they\u2019ll make a reservation.\n\nOne way to get personal with your customers is to use OptinMonster\u2019s Smart\nTags feature. That lets you use information you already have to personalize\nfuture interactions.\n\nIn the example below, this travel firm already has the person\u2019s name, and has\nused that to get their attention for an offer.\n\nAnd in this example, the store has used the person\u2019s browsing history to make\nan offer based on what they were looking at. It\u2019s easy to see how a travel\nsite could use this to show offers related to particular destinations,\nexperiences or types of travel.\n\n**2\\. Include videos**\n\nDid you know that, according to Econsultancy, 66% of travelers watch videos\nwhen researching a destination? That\u2019s why it makes sense to include videos in\nyour email marketing.\n\nAs our video marketing statistics roundup shows, marketers who use video\nincrease brand awareness by 54% and get 66% more leads.\n\nIn addition to using videos in your emails, you can grab travelers\u2019 attention\nearly by embedding travel videos in your OptinMonster optin forms. In fact,\nwe\u2019ve got a couple of themes that are particularly suited to video embeds.\n\nHere\u2019s a tutorial on embedding video with OptinMonster, plus a guide for\nshowing an optin after a video, if you prefer that approach.\n\n**3\\. Use their location**\n\nConsider adapting your email marketing campaigns, based on where travelers are\nlocated. It\u2019s another useful type of personalization.\n\nYou can do that by using OptinMonster\u2019s geolocation addon to target optins by\nlocation, and this same information can then form part of your campaigns.\n\nLitmus also suggests including dynamic content in emails to pull in weather\ninformation for customers\u2019 location or destination. Weather\u2019s a factor for\nalmost half of travelers from cold weather states, so sharing a little\nsunshine in your next email could be a big draw.\n\n**4\\. Make your offers urgent**\n\nUrgency is a tried and true marketing tactic, and nothing says \u201cbuy now\u201d like\na limited time offer. Digital Marketer used urgency to get a conversion rate\nof 8.45% for one optin campaign.\n\nYou can use this technique for your travel email marketing. We\u2019re willing to\nbet that flash travel sales are one of the reasons some people make those\nunexpected travel purchases we mentioned earlier.\n\nOptinMonster\u2019s is the perfect way to do this. Just use a floating bar optin\nwith the countdown theme, and set an end date for your sale. Here\u2019s the full\ntutorial on creating a sales timer. We\u2019ve had amazing results with this combo,\nso we know it works.\n\n**5\\. Detect their device**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, mobile is where it\u2019s at for travel email marketing, so\nmake sure your optin campaigns are appropriate for the device subscribers are\nusing.\n\nOptinMonster\u2019s page level targeting feature can also detect when users are on\na tablet or phone and show the right campaign accordingly.\n\nYou can even use our InactivitySensor\u2122 (which we like to call exit intent for\nmobile) to pop up a travel offer when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no activity taking\nplace.\n\nBoth these approaches can help boost mobile conversions. Here are some more\ntips for maximizing conversions from your mobile optins.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re looking for more inspiration, take a leaf out of Expedia\u2019s\nbook. According to Tnooz, the company has gone mobile first, to match their\ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They test everything on the small screen, and make\nsure it works there before rolling it out to the desktop version.\n\nNow you know how to keep those bookings coming with travel industry email\nmarketing, check out these simple ways to get even more email subscribers.\n\nAnd follow us on Twitter and Facebook for more in-depth guides.\n\nShareTweetSharePin\n\nPublished by Sharon Hurley Hall\n\nSharon Hurley Hall has been a professional writer for more than 25 years, and\nis certified in content marketing and email marketing.

Pricing, Features, & Alternatives\n\n_by_ Farjad Taheer _on_ February 9, 2023\n\nShareTweetSharePin\n\nPeople often ask us, \u201cIs OptinMonster free?\u201d And it\u2019s a fair question.\n\nHaving worked with other SaaS companies, people have found a few brands that\noffer a \u201cfreemium\u201d service. That\u2019s a basic free plan before upgrading to a\nmore advanced one.\n\nSo, when they come to OptinMonster, it\u2019s only natural that they\u2019d like to know\nif we have a free plan, too.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in today\u2019s post, we\u2019re going to look at OptinMonster\u2019s pricing\nplans and features and compare OptinMonster alternatives.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s answer the main question head-on: \u201cIs OptinMonster free?\u201d\n\n## Is OptinMonster Free?\n\nOptinMonster is not free and doesn\u2019t offer a free version (or a \u201cfreemium\u201d\nplan). Instead, OptinMonster offers some of the most powerful marketing and\nlead generation tools at an affordable price.\n\nOptinMonster also lets users get started for a free 14-day money-back\nguarantee, so there\u2019s no risk getting started.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of OptinMonster\u2019s plan by price (billed annually):\n\n  * **Basic:** $9/month\n  * **Plus:** $19/month\n  * **Pro:** $29/month\n  * **Growth:** $49/month\n\nStarting with the **Basic** plan, you get OptinMonster for 1 site with 2,500\npage views.\n\nThis plan is more than enough for many small businesses or solopreneurs and\ncosts less than your monthly streaming services like Netflix or Hulu.\n\nAs you upgrade, new features unlock to help you scale your business.\n\nFor example, the **Plus** plan has everything in the **Basic** plan but allows\nfor 2 sites and 10,000 page views. It also has advanced integrations, A/B\ntesting capabilities, content locking, and many other features to grow your\nemail list quickly.\n\nThe **Pro** plan (our most popular) has everything in the **Plus** plan but\ngives you 3 sites with 25,000 page views. It also comes with our Exit-Intent\u00ae\nTechnology, 2 sub-accounts, campaign scheduling, Yes/No forms, countdown\ntimers, and more.\n\nFinally, the **Growth** plan has everything in the **Pro** plan but gives you\n5 sites with 100,000 page views.\n\nThis unlocks many advanced features like OnSite Retargeting\u00ae, Follow-up\nCampaigns\u00ae, success scripts tracking, spin-to-win wheel templates, unlimited\nsub-accounts, and much more.\n\nGet Started With OptinMonster Risk-Free Today!  \n\n**BONUS: Done-For-You Campaign Setup ($297 value)** Our conversion experts\nwill design 1 free campaign for you to get maximum results \u2013 absolutely FREE!\nClick here to get started \u2192\n\nWe created these plans to make OptinMonster the most suitable lead generation\ntool for companies of all sizes.\n\nOptinMonster is consistently known as the best software for growing your email\nlist, increasing conversions, and driving more sales from your website.\n\nBut, seriously, why would you pay for a lead generation tool like\nOptinMonster? Why wouldn\u2019t you find an alternative offering a free starter\nplan?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the question in more detail: why pay for OptinMonster?\n\n## Why Pay for OptinMonster?\n\n### 1\\. Create Powerful Campaigns in Minutes\n\nWhen you\u2019re purchasing any new tool for marketing or sales, you\u2019re buying two\nthings:\n\n  * **Results:** You have a specific goal in mind and need help getting there\n  * **Time:** Not only do you expect results, but the right tool should also save you time while getting them\n\nThese are important considerations to keep in mind, especially when shopping\nfor lead generation tools.\n\nIf you want the best results in the shortest amount of time, you need software\nthat\u2019s as powerful as it is reliable. And we\u2019ve had customers come to\nOptinMonster after trying \u201cfreemium\u201d plans with other lead generation tools.\n\nThe optin campaigns (popups, floating bars, fullscreen campaigns, and so on)\nfrom these free plans were glitchy and unreliable at best. Sometimes they\nworked, and sometimes they didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd after the free plan, upgrades became expensive. This discouraged people\nfrom using paid plans.\n\nThis can lead to months or even years of stalling your company\u2019s growth as you\ntry to get new leads into your funnel.\n\nBut with OptinMonster, you\u2019ll get a reliable and powerful tool right out of\nthe gate. Plus, with our drag-and-drop builder, you\u2019ll have professional optin\ncampaigns in minutes.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of an OptinMonster campaign we built:\n\nFrom start to finish, this popup was ready to go **in under 5 minutes**. It\nrequires zero coding and is designed to get the results you want as quickly as\npossible.\n\nOptinMonster is how Adam Enfroy added **over 11,000 email addresses** to his\nlist in just one year.\n\nWith plans starting at only $9/month, it\u2019s easy to see how it\u2019s a tool worth\npaying for.\n\n### 2\\. Target Your Ideal Audience\n\nBuilding professional-looking campaigns are only half the battle. The other\nhalf is making sure they\u2019re seen by the right people and at just the right\ntime in their customer journey.\n\nFor that, you need effective display rules to get the job done.\n\nMore than any other lead generation software available, OptinMonster is your\nbest bet for connecting with your target audience. That\u2019s because we offer the\nmost advanced and comprehensive display rules around.\n\nThese rules breakdown into two categories:\n\n  * **Targets** : This relies on a visitor\u2019s demographics including the content they enjoy, the device they\u2019re using, where they\u2019re physically located, and more\n  * **Triggers** : This relies on a visitor\u2019s behavior, like how far down a page they scroll, if they\u2019re trying to leave your browser page, when they click specific links or buttons, and more\n\nSome of the more popular targeting rules include:\n\n  * **Exit-Intent\u00ae Technology** **:** Recover visitors actively leaving your website with exit intent popups.\n  * **Page Level Targeting** **:** Personalize your campaigns by making your offers match the content your user reads.\n  * **Geolocation** **:** Increase conversion rates by targeting people by their physical location.\n\nWith OptinMonster\u2019s extensive targets and triggers, you can grow your email\nlist more quickly and drive more revenue. Just check out some of these success\nstories we\u2019ve seen customers achieve:\n\n  * Crossrope explodes their email list by 900%\n  * Expat.com grew its community by 30,000 members a month\n  * Fastrack recovers 53% of abanding visitors with Exit-Intent\u00ae\n\nOptinMonster helps you get your brand\u2019s voice and message in front of the\nright people. You can get new leads and nurture them into loyal customers.\n\n### 3\\. Rely on a Dedicated Support Team\n\nOne thing that people often forget about \u201cfreemium\u201d plans or free plugins for\nWordPress sites is that support will be limited.\n\nIt takes a lot of people, training, and tooling to create a dedicated support\nteam to help customers. As such, many companies will save their support staff\nfor paying customers.\n\nOptinMonster has one of the best support teams around. But don\u2019t take our word\nfor it. Here\u2019s a customer review from the 3rd-party site Capterra:\n\nAnd another one from G2:\n\nThese are only two examples you can find around the web about our support\nteam, though there are many others.\n\nBecause with OptinMonster, we never want users to feel \u201cstuck\u201d or \u201calone.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why we offer the following channels for support:\n\n  * Thorough documentation of our product\n  * Live chat for instant results\n  * User-submitted tickets (via email)\n  * Social media channels\n  * YouTube tutorials\n  * Blog (with weekly updates)\n\nIn other words, if you need help with OptinMonster, you\u2019ve got six different\nways to grab our attention.\n\nAnd yes, this stellar support is included in your $9/month **Basic** plan.\n\n### 4\\. Automate and Refine Your Marketing Strategy\n\nWhen it comes to improving any aspect of your marketing and sales, there is no\n\u201csilver bullet.\u201d In other words, any of your tools will rarely work in\nisolation.\n\nInstead, you need tools that are easy to integrate into your current marketing\nflow. This is important because it allows you to free up lots of time once\nyou\u2019ve made some initial configurations.\n\nOptinMonster automates and enhances at least two aspects of your marketing\nstrategy:\n\n  * Email marketing\n  * Paid ads\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at how.\n\n#### a) Email Marketing\n\nFirst, OptinMonster natively integrates with over 30 of the most popular email\nmarketing services (also known as \u201cemail service providers\u201d or \u201cESPs\u201d).\n\nThat means, for the most part, you can find your ESP from a drop-down menu in\nthe OptinMonster dashboard:\n\nWhen you find your ESP, you\u2019ll be able to connect with OptinMonster in\nseconds. Usually, the connection only requires copying and pasting an API key\nfound in your email provider\u2019s user dashboard.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set this up, your new leads will go directly to your contact list,\nwhich means everything can run on autopilot.\n\nYou can get your new lead with OptinMonster, and create automated email\ncampaigns to start when a new lead subscribes.\n\nNeed help getting hooked up to your ESP? No worries. Check out this helpful\nresource: How to Connect OptinMonster to an Email Service Provider.\n\n#### **b) Paid Ads**\n\nMost paid ad platforms offer websites a small snippet of tracking code. You\ncan put this code on your website to help your paid ad platform determine who\nshould see your ads.\n\nLet\u2019s say you started using Facebook ads and installed a Facebook pixel on\nyour site.\n\nWhen a new visitor reaches your site, that tracking pixel will let Facebook\nknow this would be a good candidate to see your ad.\n\nThis process is known as retargeting, and it\u2019s incredibly effective at getting\nyou better leads and higher sales.\n\nBut here\u2019s the best part: add these tracking code bits to your OptinMonster\ncampaigns. That means when a user interacts with your optin forms, it\u2019ll let\nother platforms know to show this person your advertisement later in their\nfeed.\n\nFor more information, check out this post: How to Boost the ROI of PPC\nCampaigns With Targeted Optins.\n\nThe point is that OptinMonster makes it easy to work with other tools and\nachieve your marketing or sales goals.\n\nIt allows you to switch parts of your marketing strategy on autopilot. It also\nrefines your paid ad efforts to make more targeted offers to your ideal buyer.\n\nIn the end, this brings in better leads for your funnel and more profits for\nyour business. This leads us to our next and final benefit: increasing revenue\nwith OptinMonster.\n\n### 5\\. Profit From Your Mailing List\n\nLast but certainly not least, we get to the real point of why OptinMonster is\nworth paying for: OptinMonster pays for itself in many cases.\n\nThis should be true of any marketing tool that you invest in. And this type of\nthinking creates a profitable cycle:\n\n  * Your new marketing tool lets you grow in ways you couldn\u2019t before\n  * That growth leads to higher profits\n  * Those profits lead to other marketing tools that help you scale\n\nIn other words, a marketing tool should always bring you a high ROI. This begs\nthe question: Is OptinMonster worth at least $9/month?\n\nRather than speak for ourselves, check out some of the results our customers\nhave achieved using OptinMonster:\n\n  * Shotkit added 40+ NEW leads every single day\n  * Cosmetic Packaging grew its email list by 754%\n  * Hubstaff increased free trial signups by 21%\n  * RocketBots boosted their list by 680%\n  * Stays.net improved SaaS sales by 10% with MonsterLinks\u2122\n\nThese are just a few examples of OptinMonster helping companies grow, but\nthere are many others.\n\nSo when we see our customers experience rapid growth, increase their\nconversions, and see massive jumps in sales, we can\u2019t help but feel confident\nthat OptinMonster is worth every penny.\n\nWant to find out for yourself?

In addition to its robust plugins,\nOptinMonster is a standalone app that lives on its website. To create your\noptin campaigns, you\u2019ll log in to your account on the OptinMonster app\nwebsite.\n\nIf you have multiple websites, it\u2019s easy to manage them in your OptinMonster\ndashboard. That\u2019s one of the many benefits of having your campaigns hosted in\na standalone app. Your account information and campaign creation are hosted in\nthe same standalone app.\n\nOptinMonster has an array of different campaign types to choose from.\n\nTop that up with 100+ inbuilt, saving you time to get started.\n\n\n\nIf you are not interested in the built-in templates, OptinMonster offers the\nmost user-friendly drag-and-drop builder to build and customize a campaign of\nyour choice.\n\nYou can detect your visitors\u2019 behavior and use smart triggers to display the\nright campaign to the right person at the right time.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, you can find a detailed comparison between OptinMonster\nalternatives here.\n\n## Is OptinMonster Free? No, but It\u2019s Worth It\n\nOptinMonster isn\u2019t free. But when you consider the number of leads and profits\nit can generate for your business, you quickly realize that it might as well\nbe.\n\nOptinMonster is the most powerful lead generation tool on the market.
