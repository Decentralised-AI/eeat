That\u2019s a question that travel marketers have to wrestle with\nevery day.\n\nTravel is one of the world\u2019s largest industries, contributing US$7.6 trillion\nto the world economy, according to Statista. Global tourism revenue in 2016\nwas US$1.26 trillion, and around 1.2 million people traveled internationally\nin 2016.\n\nWith a lot of competition, and a large potential market, it\u2019s essential to\nfind effective ways to reach new customers, retain existing ones, and make\nyour business stand out. One of the best ways to do that is with travel\nindustry email marketing.\n\nAs our email marketing statistics roundup shows, Statista says more than 90%\nof American adults use email. Email has an ROI of $38 for every dollar spent,\nwhich is better than the ROI for both direct mail and social media.\n\nThis guide will show how marketers and travelers view travel industry email\nmarketing. It\u2019ll look at the increasing importance of mobile, and will give\nsome email marketing tips and best practices for the travel industry.\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll know how to nail travel industry email marketing so that\nmore people use your travel business to book flights, reserve accommodation,\nrent cars, and do other travel-related tasks.\n\n### Benefits of Email Marketing for Travel Companies\n\nEmail marketing has a lot to offer the travel industry, and travel industry\nprofessionals know it. According to Mailchimp, travel email marketing has a\n20.69% open rate.\n\nThat\u2019s no doubt why 84% of brands use email marketing to help them retain\ncustomers.\n\nWith people starting to plan their trips 84 days ahead, according to Litmus,\nemail marketing helps woo customers while they\u2019re making their minds up, and\ncan even make people who weren\u2019t planning a trip decide to buy. That\u2019s a nice\nboost to the bottom line.\n\nOther benefits of travel email marketing include:\n\n  * Building brand loyalty among your existing customers.\n  * Attracting and retaining new customers.\n  * Letting small travel firms compete successfully for attention with larger ones.\n  * Getting your share of a large, vibrant market. In the US alone, travelers spend $31,400 a second, according to the USTA.\n\n### Smartphones: World\u2019s Favorite Travel Accessory\n\nThere\u2019s one major industry trend that affects how you\u2019ll implement your email\nmarketing strategy as a travel marketer: the rise of the smartphone.\n\nSmartphones have become a favorite travel accessory for 76% of people, says\nEye for Travel.\n\nAnd while they\u2019re on vacation, 85% of people use their phones to manage\ndifferent aspects of their trips, says WebPageFX.\n\nThose two trends add up to one important fact: **if you\u2019re marketing to the\ntravel industry today, you need a mobile marketing strategy**.\n\nPeople already use their phones to plan and book their trips, check in for\ntravel (64% of travelers use mobile check in), and to do more research while\ntraveling. That means that even while people are on their trips, there\u2019s a\nchance for travel industry marketers to reach them with compelling offers.\n\nBy 2018, more than a third of online travel bookings will come from mobile\ndevices. As with other industries, younger travelers use their phones even\nmore. More than half of people under 30 have booked hotel accommodation on\ntheir smartphones.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s no surprise that, according to Performance Horizon, travel\nbrands expect mobile to have an increasing influence on travel sales. And Eye\nfor Travel says 79% of travel industry executives see mobile marketing as one\nof the biggest opportunities in the industry.\n\n### The Mobile Travel Marketing Opportunity\n\nFor travel marketers, the mobile opportunity transcends national borders.\nThere are plenty of places where smartphone adoption\u2019s still on the rise. That\nmeans there\u2019s a chance to target both local and international travelers with a\nmobile campaign strategy.\n\nA report from Email Monks reveals that 69% of travel emails are opened on\nmobile devices. And Litmus says that 45% of people read emails from travel\nbrand emails on their phones.\n\nThe bottom line **: travelers are using mobile devices at every stage of their\njourneys**. Common activities include looking up hotel addresses, checking\nflight schedules, finding things to do at the destination, as well as taking\nphotos, using maps and finding attractions, activities and restaurants.\n\n### Travel Email Marketing and Mobile Conversions\n\nThere\u2019s just one caveat. Despite the rise of mobile, travel brands can\u2019t\nignore desktops. The reason: conversions. Although people research\ndestinations on mobile devices, for now, at least, more people complete travel\nsales on desktop computers.\n\nAccording to Eye for Travel, the desktop conversion rate is 2.7x higher than\nmobile. Their stats show a global conversion rate of 1.1% on mobile devices,\nand 3% on desktops. Booking.com has a higher mobile conversion rate at 2.6%,\nbut this still lags behind their desktop conversion rate of 6.5%.\n\nData from Smart Insights also supports this, showing that desktop conversions\nsignificantly outweigh those on mobile in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific\nregion.\n\nThis means that travel industry email marketing has to combine a mobile\nmarketing strategy for raising awareness and nurturing customers with a cross-\ndevice strategy for completing sales.\n\nNow let\u2019s get started with our travel industry email marketing tips. If you\u2019re\njust starting your travel business, you\u2019ll need to follow these six steps to\nbuild and manage your list. If you already have a list, skip to the best\npractices section below.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Email List\n\nThe first step is to choose an email service provider. When choosing email\nmarketing services for travel, check that there are plenty of travel-related\nemail templates. If you want to send seasonal or niche emails (such as for\nbeach or ski holidays, for example), you\u2019ll need those.\n\nIf you\u2019re using OptinMonster to collect emails (see the next step), you\u2019ll be\nable to change the optin form templates to match your travel business, as in\nthe example below.\n\nAnother important feature to look for when choosing your email service\nprovider is analytics, so you can see how your travel marketing campaigns are\ndoing.\n\n### Step 2: Collect Email Addresses\n\nAny successful travel business has to get repeat business from existing\ncustomers, and attract new travelers. Your email list is an essential part of\nthat process, so you need to keep it healthy.\n\nA good starting point is to use an optin form on your travel website to get\nemail newsletter signups. Make sure it\u2019s visible, no matter where people are\non your site.\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to offer an incentive for signing up, like a coupon. See the\nexample below:\n\nWhen people make enquiries or reservations, that\u2019s another good opportunity to\nask them to sign up for your list. Be warned, you have to ask permission. Just\nbecause they give permission for you to email travel details, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou can send anything you like.\n\nOther travel email marketing techniques include running a contest and asking\nfor an email address in exchange for an entry, or using an SMS \u201ctext to\nsubscribe\u201d campaign.\n\nWant to learn how to improve your SMS marketing strategy? Check out this\narticle on how to collect phone numbers on your website with popups.\n\nYou can also use OptinMonster to encourage people to sign up by targeting your\noptin offers. For example, you could deliver a lead magnet related to a\nparticular destination by using page-level targeting.\n\nYou can use onsite retargeting to make an offer to returning visitors. And you\ncan use exit intent to entice subscribers with a compelling offer just before\nthey leave your website.\n\nYou can also promote your email signup form on your social media sites. Here\u2019s\nhow you add an optin form to Facebook.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Email Content\n\nMany marketers struggle with content creation, so here are a few ideas for\nwhat to include in your travel marketing emails to get you started:\n\n  * Destination guides\n  * Travel tips and essential information\n  * Recommended destinations or trips\n  * Spotlights on attractions or events\n  * Information on holidays and festivals\n  * Reviews of both destinations and travel services\n  * Travel stories from other customers\n  * Polls and quizzes\n  * Cross-promotional offers (say, for hotels and car rental)\n\nYou can also include content from your blog (if you\u2019re not blogging yet,\nhere\u2019s how you get started), favorable press coverage, and insider views of\nyour travel company. And don\u2019t forget about deals, discounts and loyalty\noffers. Litmus says that\u2019s what most subscribers are looking for.\n\nAnd, since you\u2019ll be collecting customers\u2019 date of birth as part of any\nreservation, you can add a yearly birthday email into your email marketing\nplan, to make each customer feel truly special.\n\n### Step 4: Get the Timing Right\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what types of emails you want to send, figure out how\noften you will email your subscribers.\n\nAvoid the temptation to email too often. Our research shows that around a\nquarter of people say they get too much email from travel brands. And Campaign\nMonitor\u2018s data shows that almost 44% of people want businesses to send less\nemail.\n\nThe danger of sending too much email is that people will mark your emails as\nspam, unsubscribe or simply never open them. Those are all terrible options\nfrom a marketing viewpoint.\n\nThe latest email marketing benchmarks from GetResponse show that those who\nsend one newsletter a week get the highest open and click-through rate, at\n37.08% and 5.58% respectively, so that\u2019s a good starting point for your own\ntravel email marketing schedule.\n\nHowever, this is an average across all industries, so you\u2019ll need to work out\nthe ideal frequency for your own audience.\n\n### Step 5: Create an Email Marketing Calendar\n\nWhen you decide on email frequency, put your chosen emails into an email\nmarketing calendar, so you know exactly what to send on which dates, and can\nsee your email marketing plan at a glance. Hubspot has a useful email\nmarketing calendar template you can use.\n\nStart by putting in regular broadcasts, like emails that update customers\nabout new articles on your blog, then add any promotions for the main\nholidays. Include any announcements that you know about, such as changes\nwithin the company. Finally, fill in the blanks with some of the email types\nsuggested above.\n\n### Step 6: Send Your First Email\n\nThe first email you send subscribers is the most important, because it sets\nthe tone for your relationship with them. For most businesses, that\u2019s the\nwelcome email, which has a 60% open rate.\n\nA good welcome email will help you retain the subscribers you\u2019ve already\nattracted, and make them feel good about being on your email list. Keep your\nwelcome email short, relevant and valuable, and craft a killer email subject\nline to encourage people to open and read it.\n\nThis is a great place to ask subscribers to do one thing that gets them more\ninvolved with your company. It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated; just reading a\nblog post or sharing a piece of content begins the bonding process. You\u2019ll\nneed to nail the call to action to be effective, though.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at some practical strategies to improve your travel industry\nemail marketing.\n\n### 5 Tips for Successful Travel Email Marketing\n\n**1\\. Personalize your marketing**\n\nThere may be billions of travelers worldwide, but each one wants to feel\nspecial. According to SmartInsights, 83% of millennials are happy for travel\nbrands to track them so they can get personalized service. And 85% of\ntravelers prefer customized, rather than generic, itineraries.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to tailor your travel industry email marketing\npromotions to people\u2019s behavior and interests. The more relevant an offer is,\nthe more likely it is that they\u2019ll make a reservation.\n\nOne way to get personal with your customers is to use OptinMonster\u2019s Smart\nTags feature. That lets you use information you already have to personalize\nfuture interactions.\n\nIn the example below, this travel firm already has the person\u2019s name, and has\nused that to get their attention for an offer.\n\nAnd in this example, the store has used the person\u2019s browsing history to make\nan offer based on what they were looking at. It\u2019s easy to see how a travel\nsite could use this to show offers related to particular destinations,\nexperiences or types of travel.\n\n**2\\. Include videos**\n\nDid you know that, according to Econsultancy, 66% of travelers watch videos\nwhen researching a destination? That\u2019s why it makes sense to include videos in\nyour email marketing.\n\nAs our video marketing statistics roundup shows, marketers who use video\nincrease brand awareness by 54% and get 66% more leads.\n\nIn addition to using videos in your emails, you can grab travelers\u2019 attention\nearly by embedding travel videos in your OptinMonster optin forms. In fact,\nwe\u2019ve got a couple of themes that are particularly suited to video embeds.\n\nHere\u2019s a tutorial on embedding video with OptinMonster, plus a guide for\nshowing an optin after a video, if you prefer that approach.\n\n**3\\. Use their location**\n\nConsider adapting your email marketing campaigns, based on where travelers are\nlocated. It\u2019s another useful type of personalization.\n\nYou can do that by using OptinMonster\u2019s geolocation addon to target optins by\nlocation, and this same information can then form part of your campaigns.\n\nLitmus also suggests including dynamic content in emails to pull in weather\ninformation for customers\u2019 location or destination. Weather\u2019s a factor for\nalmost half of travelers from cold weather states, so sharing a little\nsunshine in your next email could be a big draw.\n\n**4\\. Make your offers urgent**\n\nUrgency is a tried and true marketing tactic, and nothing says \u201cbuy now\u201d like\na limited time offer. Digital Marketer used urgency to get a conversion rate\nof 8.45% for one optin campaign.\n\nYou can use this technique for your travel email marketing. We\u2019re willing to\nbet that flash travel sales are one of the reasons some people make those\nunexpected travel purchases we mentioned earlier.\n\nOptinMonster\u2019s is the perfect way to do this. Just use a floating bar optin\nwith the countdown theme, and set an end date for your sale. Here\u2019s the full\ntutorial on creating a sales timer. We\u2019ve had amazing results with this combo,\nso we know it works.\n\n**5\\. Detect their device**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, mobile is where it\u2019s at for travel email marketing, so\nmake sure your optin campaigns are appropriate for the device subscribers are\nusing.\n\nOptinMonster\u2019s page level targeting feature can also detect when users are on\na tablet or phone and show the right campaign accordingly.\n\nYou can even use our InactivitySensor\u2122 (which we like to call exit intent for\nmobile) to pop up a travel offer when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no activity taking\nplace.\n\nBoth these approaches can help boost mobile conversions. Here are some more\ntips for maximizing conversions from your mobile optins.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re looking for more inspiration, take a leaf out of Expedia\u2019s\nbook. According to Tnooz, the company has gone mobile first, to match their\ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They test everything on the small screen, and make\nsure it works there before rolling it out to the desktop version.\n\nNow you know how to keep those bookings coming with travel industry email\nmarketing, check out these simple ways to get even more email subscribers.\n\nAnd follow us on Twitter and Facebook for more in-depth guides.\n\nShareTweetSharePin\n\nPublished by Sharon Hurley Hall\n\nSharon Hurley Hall has been a professional writer for more than 25 years, and\nis certified in content marketing and email marketing.
