There are many reasons to love\nit, but a big one is how impressive the return can be. Email can generate\n3,600% ROI when done right (unbelievable, right?), making it a highly\neffective yet affordable medium for most brands. With very little risk, email\nmarketing is a standout marketing strategy compared to most out there.\n\nFor the travel and tourism industry, this is important. COVID-19 has hit this\nindustry hard the past few years, so utilizing marketing channels that require\nvery little investment is a must. And if these channels can promise\nsubstantial return, well, that\u2019s even better.\n\nWith summer in full swing, we\u2019d like to take this time to highlight some\nimpressive and inspiring emails from noted brands within the travel and\ntourism industry. Let\u2019s take a look at the types of emails these brands are\nusing to attract, nurture, and convert prospective travelers.\n\n## 1\\. Welcome Email\n\nWelcome emails present an excellent opportunity to generate interest and move\nprospective travelers down the marketing funnel. They are often used as part\nof an automated series, delivered to potential customers when they sign up for\na newsletter or join your email list.\n\nThe time period immediately after someone signs up for email marketing is\ntypically when they are the most eager to learn more about the brand. Besides\nproviding more details about the business, the welcome email is an opportunity\nto remind customers to set their preferences to receive custom offers, or\ncomplete an aspect of their profile, like this example from Airbnb.\n\nSource\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re all familiar with this lodging and tourism brand, and chances are you\u2019ve\nused them before. What\u2019s different about Airbnb is that it also brings people\ntogether, so each user having a robust profile is important. Airbnb wastes no\ntime encouraging users to provide this information so they can get the most\nout of their services. They also use this welcome email to highlight some of\nthe unique perks that come with using them, like the opportunity to stay at\ntruly unique spaces like igloos and treehouses.\n\n## 2\\. Promo/Offer Email\n\nOnce someone subscribes, while they may be eager to learn more, they may not\nbe ready to immediately pull the trigger on a purchase. They need to learn\nmore about your company and offerings.\n\nA few days after the welcome email, send an email that gives the traveler a\nreason to purchase by presenting them with an offer or promo. This email from\nSesame Place shows a promotion for the season pass membership and highlights\nspecific reasons why becoming a pass member is worth it. By outlining the\nperks, it\u2019s giving readers a reason to click to learn more and purchase the\nmembership.\n\nSource\n\n## 3\\. Confirmation Email\n\nOnce a traveler makes a booking, follow up with their trip details in a\nconfirmation email so they have everything they need and can access it easily.\nThis will help ensure everything goes smoothly for them on the day of their\ntravel, and they\u2019ll be grateful that you gave them one less thing to worry\nabout.\n\nInclude clear details about the scheduled travel in the confirmation email. In\naddition, you could include complimentary offers or deals that the customer\nmay like based on their preferences. After all, they decided to go with your\nbrand over numerous others out there, so showing them you appreciate them with\na deal will go a long way.\n\nThis confirmation email from Delta is simple, which is perfect for a\nconfirmation email that includes flight information. There\u2019s no need to stuff\nunnecessary information, design, or images in these kinds of emails because it\ncould potentially cloud the important details and confuse the recipient.\n\nSource\n\n## 4\\. Reminder Email\n\nEngagement with customers doesn\u2019t end with the confirmation email. When it\ngets closer to the scheduled trip, sending a reminder email with details and\nadditional information is always a good decision.\n\nPeople are busy and sometimes wait until the last minute to pack and plan for\ntheir upcoming trips (guilty as charged!) By sending a reminder email that\nincoludes information to help the traveler make better decisions, like what to\npack and bring, is a creative way to say, \u201cHey, it\u2019s time to get ready for\nyour trip!\u201d\n\nThis email from Vacasa includes details about when the room will be ready, as\nwell as a weekly forecast so the traveler can pack everything needed.\n\nSource\n\n\n\nWe love the thoughtfulness and creativity. Make sure your reminder emails\ninclude any scheduling updates, weather forecasts, bad weather warnings,\ntravel guides, or details about what the traveler should expect on the trip.\nIt might also be a good idea to also include any COVID protocols your area is\npracticing.\n\n## 5\\. Milestone Email\n\nNothing is better than building a long-lasting relationship with a customer.\nIn the travel and tourism industry, that\u2019s especially important since there\nare so many other brands and options for travelers to use.\n\nMake sure you gather details about your customers so you can send them\nmilestone emails. Ask them why they\u2019re booking with you (wedding anniversary,\nhoneymoon, birthday celebration, etc.) You can track this information and send\nthem a milestone email a year later with a promo to book with you again. This\nlets them know you want to help them celebrate their important moments year\nafter year.  \n\nThis email from HotelTonight highlights all the says their customer had the\npast year, their perks, and their favorite stays. It also opens with the\nopportunity to \u201cmake more memories.\u201d\n\nSource\n\n## 6\\. Thank You Email\n\nWhen the stay, vacation, or travel is over, send your customer a thank you\nemail to show that you appreciate them for booking with you. This is also an\nopportunity to increase customer retention with an exclusive offer or deal.\n\nYou could also ask the traveler to rate how much they enjoyed the experience\nor gather more detailed feedback to help deliver a better experience next\ntime. See how Airbnb did this with their simple customer survey email below:\n\nSource\n\n\n\n## Keep Travelers Engaged Via Email\n\nAs you can see, there are so many opportunities for the travel and tourism\nindustry to utilize email and create a positive customer experience. To keep\ntravelers engaged, use a consistent email marketing strategy rooted in\npersonalization, with the occasional promo thrown in.\n\nQuality email marketing software, like Benchmark Email, helps you drive\npersonalization and engagement through the entire customer journey.
