If\nyou work for a travel agency, it\u2019s time to start an email marketing campaign\nto boost the recovery of your business and engage new customers. Read this\narticle and learn about tips and best practices and create effective travel\nagency emails.\n\n## Why email marketing for travel agencies is so important\n\nTourism was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 people traveled less due to\nrestrictions and infection threat. According to UNWTO, in 2020 international\ntourism receipts dropped by 62% compared to 2019. International arrivals\nfollowed this trend \u2014 the decrease reached 72%.\n\nSource: World Tourism Organization\n\nAnd lockdowns were not the only factor. Measures were less strict in 2021 but\npeople still were not ready to travel. For example, according to Statista, 42%\nof Spanish citizens planned to decrease their travel budgets for 2021.\n\nSource: Statista\n\nBut what about 2022? Consider this graph.\n\nTourist arrivals in Europe from January 2019 to March 2022. Source: Statista\n\nAs you can see, people started traveling more often than in 2020 or even last\nyear. And that\u2019s why email marketing for travel agencies is important \u2014 it\u2019s\nan easy way to re-engage your former clients and boost the recovery of your\nbusiness.\n\n## The key aspects of a successful travel agent email to a client\n\nNow that you know the importance of email marketing for travel agencies, let\u2019s\ntake a look at the recipe for a good email campaign in this industry.\n\n### Personalization\n\n71% of customers expect personalized communication from brands. When it comes\nto personalization in email marketing, it\u2019s more than including your\ncustomer\u2019s name in the greeting or the subject. One of the ways to make your\nmarketing emails more personal is giving relevant recommendations.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nFor example, Airbnb implemented location-based personalization. Right after\nthe customer arrives somewhere, they suggest what to do and where to go.\n\n### Subject lines\n\nA good email subject line can vastly improve your open rates. Here\u2019s how you\ncan create catchy subject lines specifically for travel agency emails:\n\n**Appeal to the value of traveling.** People travel for different reasons \u2014\ndepending on the niche of your agency, you can use different buzzwords in your\nsubject lines. Possible options include:\n\n  * Discovery, Enlightenment, Experience\n  * Relaxation, Vacation, Getaway, Weekend\n  * Adventure, Bucket list, Road trip\n\nThese word groups appeal to different audiences \u2014 know your customers and use\nwhat triggers them.\n\n**Use urgency markers.** Word combinations like \u201cLast chance\u201d, \u201cStarts now\u201d,\n\u201cDon\u2019t miss it\u201d, and other similar subject lines will trigger FOMO. But don\u2019t\noverdo this \u2014 some words might get you a one-way ticket to the spam folder.\n\n**Use jokes and puns.** A funny email subject is a great way to stand out in\nyour customer\u2019s inbox. Examples include \u201cCzech this out: 10 places to see in\nPrague\u201d or \u201cBeen to South America? I don\u2019t Bolivia\u201d. Opportunities are endless\n\u2014 use your sense of humor to increase sales.\n\n**Get down to business.** For sales emails, the best tactic is to describe\nyour offer in the subject line. Examples include \u201cGet 30% off our July package\nholidays\u201d or \u201cSave money on your next dream vacation\u201d.\n\n### Use of visual aids\n\nThere are many ways to use visual aids. You can use photos, GIFs, videos, and\nillustrations \u2014 or come up with a minimalist email design that only highlights\nthe important elements. Typefaces and layouts also count \u2014 they make customers\npay attention to important parts of email content like CTAs.\n\nSource: Email Competitors\n\nThis World Food Day email from Contiki Travel Tours uses vibrant pictures and\nwarm colors to create a certain mood. But aside from photos, they accentuated\nthe part with CTA with an all-caps header and a bold yellow frame. These\nsimple tricks instantly draw attention to the button.\n\n### Sense of urgency\n\nThe usage of FOMO in email marketing is not limited to travel agencies. For\nexample, it\u2019s often used in retail during Black Friday or holiday-related\npromotion campaigns.\n\nSource: Email Competitors\n\nThis email from Friendly Planet is a great example of how urgency works in\ncampaigns for travel agents. Its subject line is \u201cOur newest trips + Last\nchance to save!\u201d and we see a big \u201cDeals expire tonight!\u201d header in the email\nbody. Urgency is created via verbal cues \u2014 use them in email subjects and\ncontent copies.\n\n### Shared opportunities\n\nEven the most aesthetically pleasing email with the funniest subject line\nwouldn\u2019t work without a valuable offer. Here are some ideas for what you can\nsuggest to your customers via email:\n\n  * Promo codes and discounts\n  * Last-minute tours that are cheaper than regular tours\n  * Convenience \u2014 for example, a fully-planned vacation plan\n  * Helpful content related to traveling \u2014 for example, guides on packaging or what to see in a certain city\n  * Unique experiences \u2014 these offers work best for niche travel agencies\n\n## Most popular travel agency email types\n\nAnother promo code is not the only reason to send emails. Let\u2019s take a look at\nthe most popular travel agency email types. Most of these email types are not\nspecific to the industry \u2014 but they work well for travel agencies too.\n\n### Welcome emails\n\nSending a welcome email to a new customer is like giving a house tour to a\nfirst-time guest. If you show your guest where the bathroom is and offer them\ntea, they will be more comfortable staying at your place and might come over\nagain.\n\nIt works the same with email marketing. According to GetResponse, welcome\nemails have a 50% open rate, which is 86% better compared to newsletters.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nThis email from AllTrails is a great example of onboarding \u2014 they give the\nguide on using the service right away.\n\n### Newsletters\n\nA newsletter is an email you send regularly to share updates. They can be used\nfor introducing new offers, giving them something fun or useful to read, or\ninviting them to take part in a contest. Newsletters are great because:\n\n  * It\u2019s a good source of traffic for your website.\n  * It increases brand recognition \u2014 the tone of voice and the choice of content add more details to your brand personality and make it more charismatic.\n  * It increases customer loyalty \u2014 by regular communication, you build stronger relationships between customers and your business.\n  * It gives room for personalization \u2014 by tailoring suggested website content, you can increase customer satisfaction. \n\nAnd speaking of personalization, here\u2019s a great example from Airbnb.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nThey came up with a newsletter specifically for hosts \u2014 and included lifehacks\nand policy updates.\n\n### Confirmation emails\n\nCustomers need confirmation emails so they know that the transaction was\nsuccessful. They also need these emails to get important information like\ndelivery details or the hotel\u2019s address. Confirmation emails also give further\ndirections for the next step in the customer flow \u2014 that\u2019s why they are so\nimportant.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nA good example of a confirmation email is this one from Vacasa. It contains\nall the necessary information for checking in \u2014 the lockbox code, the address\nand driving directions, and even the weather forecast for easier packing.\n\n### Thank you messages\n\nThank you messages are sent after a customer completes the target action \u2014\nlike buying something or subscribing to an email list. They might not be as\nimportant for the customer journey as confirmation emails. But thank you notes\nexpress appreciation and help you build warmer relationships with your\ncustomers.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nThis email from HotelTonight is a great example of a thank you note for a\ntraveling business. They don\u2019t just show appreciation with words \u2014 they\nsuggest what to do next, including taking part in a loyalty program.\n\n### Informational emails\n\nThere is a difference between newsletters and informational emails.\nNewsletters are sent weekly or monthly and they give an overview of the latest\nupdates. And informational emails are sent in case of emergency.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nFor example, this Airbnb informational email is about current policies and how\nthe company handles the situation.\n\n### Re-engagement emails\n\nImagine that your best friend hasn\u2019t reached you in three months and has been\nignoring your text messages where you suggested hanging out or watching a\nmovie they liked. If you forget them and move on, you will lose a friend. But\na wellness check message will increase the chance to win your friend back.\n\nEmail marketing works the same. You will lose customers \u2014 just like you will\ngrow apart from friends. But you can decrease these losses if you send re-\nengagement emails.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nThis is a great example of a personalized re-engagement email from\nTripAdvisor. They saw that a customer was browsing Boston-related pages \u2014 and\nbased on the hypothesis that this customer was too confused to make a\ndecision, they provided extra information on this region.\n\n### Seasonal offers\n\nMany industries have seasonal offers to give. But traveling is probably the\nmost season-driven industry. According to Eurostat, one-third of the nights\nEuropeans spent in tourist facilities were in July and August. And it\u2019s\nreasonable \u2014 people plan long trips for summer and short trips for holidays.\nThat\u2019s why travel agencies should send emails with seasonal offers.\n\nThis email by Sonder is a great example of how to do a seasonal offer message\nright. They don\u2019t just give an offer \u2014 they also give useful information on\nplanning a summer trip, which adds more value to the email.\n\n### Upsell emails\n\nUpsell emails suggest a more expensive version of the same product or service\nafter your customer completed the transaction. Not only does this type of\nemail increase sales \u2014 it also raises brand awareness and increases your\ncustomers\u2019 lifetime value.\n\nThis email from Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights is a perfect example of upselling. After\na new customer used their app, they suggested a premium membership and\nexplained its value. They also offered a free trial period so customers won\u2019t\nfeel pressured to spend money right now and try it out instead.\n\nKeep in mind that these are not all the possible types of emails that can be\nused for promoting travel-related businesses \u2014 we\u2019ve listed the most popular\ntypes. And these types can be mixed together. For example, you can include a\nthank you note in a confirmation email or add a seasonal offer to a monthly\nnewsletter \u2014 it depends on the goal of your campaign.\n\n## How to set up a campaign\n\nSetting up a campaign for a travel agency is not different from other\nindustries. Here\u2019s a short recap of the whole process.\n\n**Setting up a travel agency email campaign**  \n---  \n**Preparation** | **Content** | **Testing**  \nDefine the goals \ud83d\udcc8 | Choose the type \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f | QA testing \ud83e\uddea  \nBuild your list \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f | Design your email \ud83c\udfa8 | Split testing \ud83d\udca1  \nSegment the list \ud83e\udd67 |   |  \n  \n###  \n\n### Define the goals\n\nEvery campaign starts with an email marketing strategy. You need to understand\nwhy you\u2019re running a campaign in the first place \u2014 for example, to increase\nsales.\n\nThe next step is defining success criteria using the SMART framework:\n\n  * Specific\n  * Measurable\n  * Achievable\n  * Relevant\n  * Time-bound\n\nFor example, if your goal was to increase your website blog\u2019s readership, your\nsuccess criteria would look like \u201cIncrease the number of daily unique visitors\nby 30% by the end of this month\u201d.\n\n### Build your mailing list\n\nA mailing list is a list of users who will receive your marketing emails. Keep\nin mind that buying readymade email lists online and using them for marketing\ncampaigns is illegal. Build your list using opt-in forms and pop-ups. To learn\nmore, read our article about building an email list.\n\n### Segment the list\n\nSegmenting your email list is important for sending relevant emails. There are\nmany segmentation criteria \u2014 age, location, website activity, and so on. The\nchoice of criteria depends on your campaign and your market niche. To learn\nmore about segmentation with Selzy, visit this page.\n\n### Decide on the type of content\n\nThe type of content you chose will affect the subject line, the copy, the CTA,\nand the email layout. Choose the content type depending on your marketing\ncampaign goal.\n\nOne of the types of emails often used for travel agencies is last chance\nemails. Use these emails for promoting seasonal offers \u2014 and use our guide on\nlast chance emails with writing tips and best practices.\n\n### Design your email\n\nGood email design draws attention to CTAs, improves email readability and\nhelps you express the charisma of your brand. And a trendy look will keep your\nsubscribers engaged.\n\nTo learn more, read our guide on email design with tips and best practices.\n\n### Test and analyze the results\n\nOnce you\u2019re done with your email content and design, test your emails before\nsending:\n\n  * QA testing \u2014 to make sure that your email campaign is set correctly, all the hyperlinks work as intended and customers won\u2019t receive an email with a \u201cHello <undefined>\u201d greeting.\n  * Split testing \u2014 to validate your ideas and hypotheses and make smarter marketing decisions. \n\nAnd this is how you set up a campaign for a travel agency. And if you\u2019re\nafraid to miss something, use our email marketing checklist.\n\n## Best travel agency email examples\n\nNow that you know how to set up an email campaign for a travel agency, let\u2019s\ntake a look at some examples of great campaigns in the industry. We\u2019ve picked\n4 good travel agency emails for your inspiration.\n\n### Vacasa: Wanderlust-worthy road trips\n\nVacasa is a rental management company that operates in North and Central\nAmerica. And although their business is focused on destinations, they ran a\ncampaign that\u2019s all about the journey.\n\nSource: Really Good Emails\n\nDomestic and rural tourism were a big traveling trend in 2021 \u2014 and it\u2019s\npredicted to continue in 2022. Vacasa caught up on this trend and made a guide\non interesting road trip destinations within the US. We love how visually\nappealing this campaign is \u2014 and the lovely \u201cLife is a Highway\u201d CTA button.\nAnother good thing about this email is that you can look through rentals right\naway if you like a certain destination \u2014 it\u2019s convenient for customers.\n\n### Intrepid: Celebrating BIPOC culture\n\nIntrepid is a US-based company that specializes in small group tours and\nadventure trips. Since the questions of oppression and justice in the\npostcolonial world have been around for a long time, they rolled out a series\nof educational tours and ran an email campaign.\n\nSource: Email Competitors\n\nIt\u2019s hard to run a campaign like this without being offensive. Educational\ntours are great but they shouldn\u2019t look like a trip to a zoo where the\nprivileged group looks down on the culture of those who survived genocide and\noccupation. Intrepid handled the subject matter gracefully \u2014 they give the\nword to local experts and aim at educating, not just entertaining. And the\ncampaign itself is great \u2014 it\u2019s well-written, and beautiful pictures and\nminimalist email design create a stylish look.\n\n### Oliver\u2019s Travels: God Save The Queen!\n\nOliver\u2019s Travels is an agency that specializes in luxury vacations and high-\nend real estate rental in Europe. And they\u2019ve prepared something special for\nThe Queen\u2019s Jubilee.\n\nSource: Email Competitors\n\nFirst of all, just because you\u2019re a luxury brand doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t throw\na pun in an email. And they didn\u2019t stop here. Apart from the invitation, they\nadded topic-related blog articles and links to luxury castles in the UK. Maybe\nthey overdid it with CTAs. But overall, this email makes you feel like a\nqueen. Or a king.\n\n### Tripaneer: Yoga in the USA\n\nTripaneer is a travel agency that specializes in wellness holidays like\nretreats for mindfulness, weight loss, spiritual growth, and so on.\n\nSource: Email Competitors\n\nThis email about US-based yoga retreats doesn\u2019t have a lot of text \u2014 but it\u2019s\nincredibly well-written. And we appreciate creative CTAs \u2014 like the one about\nrolling down mats. We also like that Tripaneer added a link to a guide on\ntheir website instead of writing the whole article for the email.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nRunning an email campaign for a travel agency is a good way to re-engage your\ncustomers who stopped traveling due to lockdowns and increase sales. Some\ncommon types of emails for campaigns in this industry include:\n\n  * Welcome emails \u2014 use them to introduce customers to your service and explain how it works.\n  * Newsletters \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to draw more traffic to your website and stay in touch with your customers.\n  * Confirmation emails \u2014 use them to share valuable information and notify that the transaction was successful.\n  * Thank you messages \u2014 this type of email increases customer loyalty and helps you build stronger relationships.\n  * Informational emails \u2014 unlike newsletters, these emails are not sent regularly and are used to share important information, for example, about emergencies.\n  * Seasonal offers \u2014 since tourism is a season-driven industry, emails with summer vacation or holiday offers will help both you and your customers.\n  * Upsell emails \u2014 suggesting a more expensive version of what your customers already bought will increase your revenue.\n\nTo run a successful campaign for a travel agency, don\u2019t forget about:\n\n  * Personalizing your campaign to give more relevant offers\n  * Catchy subject lines \u2014 use humor, add a personal greeting, or appeal to the value of traveling depending on your niche\n  * Visual aids \u2014 they will gently coax your customer into clicking on the CTA button\n  * Sense of urgency \u2014 verbal urgency cues will trigger FOMO\n  * Shared opportunities \u2014 offer your customers something valuable.\n\n07 August, 2022\n\n#travel\n\nArticle by\n\n43 articles\n\nDaria Zhuravleva\n\nI'm a writer with 3 years of experience, knowledge and interest in all things\nIT and marketing, and a passion for the English language.
