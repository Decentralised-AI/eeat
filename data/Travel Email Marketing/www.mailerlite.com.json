For example, Carnival Corp has\nannounced that cruise bookings for the second half of 2022 are ahead of pre-\npandemic levels.\n\nThings are starting to look up for travel companies\u2014which makes this the\nperfect time to get your travel email marketing campaigns in shape.\n\nWith email marketing, you can create a direct line of communication, allowing\nyou to connect with your customers at any time. It also offers a high ROI (\n_$42 for every dollar spent_). With the right email strategy, you can build an\naudience of engaged subscribers so that your travel promotions, loyalty\nprograms and deals get the attention they deserve.\n\n* * *\n\n## How to build relationships and travel far with your subscribers\n\nWhen it comes to email marketing success, the content of your newsletters is\nkey. As a travel agency, you\u2019re competing with big shots like Google and\nKayak, so it\u2019s important to build meaningful customer relationships. This way,\nyou\u2019ll capture their hearts and diversify yourself from the crowd.\n\nIt all starts with relevant, engaging and helpful travel content. Don\u2019t just\nsend out sales pitches for good travel deals, but offer valuable information.\n\n **You'll want content ideas like:**\n\n  * Travel e-book (one of our customers offers a free cookbook with recipes that they collected whilst traveling Asia, Africa and Central America)\n\n  * Downloadable lists\n\n  * City guides and other useful information\n\n  * Travel tips\n\n  * Personal travel stories\n\n  * Calendar with the best times to book\n\n  * Quizzes\n\n  * Live tracking of which countries are on the \u2018green list\u2019 to travel\n\n### Before we continue...\n\nWhy not open a free MailerLite account and build your email campaign as you're\nreading?\n\nSign up\n\n**Tip:** Read how to create engaging email content in the guide below.\n\nHow to craft email content people care about\n\n* * *\n\n## 7 types of travel email content to send for mile-high results\n\n### **1\\. Say welcome aboard with a welcome email**\n\nA warm welcome sets the tone for the entire experience. Virtually, you need to\ndo the same with a _welcome email_.\n\nWelcome emails have a _42% higher read rate_ than standard email marketing\ncampaigns (which spells good news for your conversion rates)! With _email\nautomation_, you can magically make them arrive in your subscribers\u2019 inboxes\nthe very moment they sign up.\n\n  *  **Pro tip:** Here\u2019s how to set up a _welcome email series_ with MailerLite, our straightforward email marketing software. \ud83e\udd13 Or, check out our introduction to automation below.\n\nYour welcome email should greet your new pen pal and tell them more about you.\nA lot of travel sites tell subscribers what to expect. Some will also include\na special deal or promotion to get the ball rolling.\n\nHere\u2019s how Sonder greets its new subscribers, with a stunning apartment photo\nto catch attention, plus a stand-out call to action (CTA).\n\nImage credit: Sonder\n\n  * **Pro tip:** A CTA button should work together with all the other elements of the email newsletter to influence subscribers to take a course of action. Learn more about creating highly-effective CTAs.\n\nSkyrocket conversion rates with the perfect email call-to-action (CTA)\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Send a personalized greeting\n\nImagine walking into your hotel room and seeing a bottle of champagne and a\npersonalized welcome card with your name on it. That would definitely put a\nsmile on your face!\n\n _82% of travelers_ believe that personalization is one of the most luxurious\ntravel customer experiences\u2014so why not extend that to your email marketing\ncampaigns?\n\nReaders want tailored travel newsletters with content that they can actually\nuse. Sure, you can send American readers newsletters about how great it is\nDown Under, but how many of your subscribers can quickly hop on a plane to\nAustralia? Probably not many. It makes a lot more sense to talk about travel\ndestinations your reader can actually plan and book.\n\n _Segmentation_ lets you group your subscribers based on shared traits so that\nyou can send them tailored messages that resonate. For example, use\ninformation on the places your subscribers have visited or whether or not they\nhave children. Check the available data and see how you can use this to create\ngroups.\n\nFor example, Booking.com sends this personalized message to a subscriber who\nis just finishing their stay in a London hotel. There\u2019s even information about\nbooking a ride from their hotel to the airport!\n\nImage credit: Booking.com\n\n  * **Pro tip:** If you don\u2019t know certain information, ask! Gather data through subscriber preferences, _embedded surveys_ or contests.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Catch attention with the right imagery\n\nMany of us have no idea what other places in the world look like. That\u2019s why\nwe search for images and create Pinterest boards with all the dreamy\ndestinations we want to visit.\n\nTraveling is about experiences and emotions. Using the right images in your\nemail design can motivate readers to put your offer on top of their bucket\nlist.\n\nFor example, Vacasa tells its subscribers to \u2018Reach their dream destination\u2019,\nand then lets this stunning tropical paradise photo do the rest of the\ntalking\u2026\n\nImage credit: Vacasa\n\n  * **Pro tip:** Want to design professional-looking travel email newsletters on your own? We break down the process into two design elements in our guide on designing emails that people will read.\n\nHow to design emails people will read\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. YOLO! Express urgency in your travel newsletter\n\nTraveling costs money, but you also only have one life to explore the world.\nPlay with this sense of urgency to get people to act.\n\nUse offers and special occasions to create limited promotions. In January, you\ncan promote last-minute offers to sunny paradises. For Easter, you can\nhighlight discounted family-friendly packages.\n\nCombining your promotions with _email personalization_ makes sure your offer\nis a perfect fit for each of your subscribers.\n\nThe Hoxton promotes their limited-time 20% discount and includes \u201cWhat to tell\nyour boss\u201d excuses that surely gave their readers a good laugh.\n\nImage credit: The Hoxton\n\n  * **Pro tip:** Did you know that you can create _email coupons_ with MailerLite? Use them to boost your sale and ramp up engagement with your travel agency.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\.

Integrating pop-\nups is easy when you use an email tool. Set the frequency to a level where\nit\u2019s not annoying for your visitors.\n\nThis is how Luxury Travel Magazine uses pop-ups. They provide a clear reason\nfor signing up for their travel newsletter and only ask for an email address.\nThe sea background adds vacation vibes.\n\nImage credit: Luxury Travel Magazine\n\n#### Embedded forms\n\nYou\u2019ll often find embedded forms in the website footer and blog sidebar.
