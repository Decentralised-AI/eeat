Email\nmarketing for tourism or travel businesses has a unique set of challenges. But\nif done properly, it can be a powerful customer engagement and acquisition\ntool.\n\nThis blog looks at the critical considerations for travel email marketing and\nprovides tips for optimizing your efforts.\n\n## Email Marketing For Travel Agencies\n\nThere is no denying that the essence of travel and hospitality is in the\nexperience of the stay. But that is only possible if you can get a customer to\nbook. The right marketing strategy has the power to put travellers in the\nshoes of an experience before they commit.\n\nHigh-quality visuals, stories, and customer reviews can paint a picture of the\nexperience that awaits. Email marketing is often a key element of this\nstrategy.\n\nTravel email campaigns are targeted, creative and personal. They give email\nmarketers the ability to think beyond conventional promotions and build\nrelationships with potential customers.\n\nHowever, peak campaign performance is only possible if you understand every\ncustomer\u2019s context and user journey. For instance, about 69% of all travel\nemails today are read on mobile devices. So, creating a mobile-friendly\nexperience is of utmost importance.\n\n## **Why Is Email Marketing Important In The Travel Industry?**\n\nEmail marketing is an effective tool to keep customers engaged throughout the\nbooking process. Here are the key benefits that make email marketing important\nfor travel businesses:\n\n### **1\\. Inexpensive, Quick, And Simple To Set Up**\n\nEmail marketing is an **inexpensive** yet effective way of reaching out to\npotential customers. Setting up campaigns requires minimal effort and time,\nwith **no delivery costs** for emails sent out.\n\nWith the right email list, you can start engaging with your target audience at\na fraction of the cost compared to other digital marketing channels. Moreover,\na powerful email marketing campaign can be set up in a matter of days or even\nhours if you have the resources, such as an email template, ready to go.\n\nAll this translates to higher ROI and faster results.\n\n### **2\\. Increases Brand Loyalty And Awareness**\n\nTravel emails are a great way to build trust and loyalty. When sent with the\nright frequency and content, they make customers feel special about your\nbrand.\n\nWith every email, you can reinforce your brand values and educate customers\nabout the features of a product or service. For instance, you can inform\npeople about the importance of pre-booking or discuss local attractions and\nactivities in the area they are visiting.\n\nBy sharing regular content that genuinely helps readers, you can instil a\nsense of trust and confidence in your brand that your competitors may find\ndifficult to replicate.\n\nMoreover, email marketing helps to keep customers informed and engaged\nthroughout their journey with you. This, in turn, leads to increased brand\nawareness and recognition.\n\n### **3\\. A Customized Approach**\n\nUsing email personalization and segmentation techniques, you can deliver\ncustomized emails that offer relevant offers or discounts to customers who\nhave already shown an interest in your products.\n\nThis puts you in a better position to drive conversions and improve sales.\n\nYou can also send surveys and feedback requests to customers. This helps in\nunderstanding customer preferences and developing better strategies for the\nfuture.\n\n**For example,** a survey can help you understand the kind of content your\ncustomers are interested in or what type of discounts they prefer. This\nensures that your travel emails are always tailored to their actual needs and\nwants.\n\n### **4\\. Email And Social Media Integrated Together**\n\nIntegrating email and social media is a great way to increase your reach.\nSocial media channels are perfect for engaging with customers and building\nrelationships, but email is the best channel for conversion.\n\n**For example** , you can use social media to share updates about new\ndestinations or discounts and then direct users to a landing page that\ncaptures their email addresses. This ensures that your conversion funnel is\noptimized and you have a steady stream of warm leads.\n\n### **5\\. Reaching The Correct Segment**\n\nSegmenting your email list is one thing. But targeting the right segment is\nanother. Email marketing for tourism can help you stand out in a sea of\ncompetitors by quickly A/B testing differing segments and optimizing for the\ncorrect target audience.\n\nThis helps you to quickly identify the right messaging and audience\nsegmentation, which will increase conversions. Additionally, you can use email\nsegmentation techniques to assess customer behaviour and send out more\npersonalized messages that add value to their experience.\n\n## **12 Actionable Tips For Travel Email Marketing**\n\nEmail marketing can be an effective tool for your travel business with the\nright approach. Here are 12 actionable tips for travel email marketing to help\nyou get started:\n\n### **1\\. Nail Your Welcome Emails**\n\nMaking a good first impression is crucial. And in the ruthless world of\ndigital competition, you might not get a second chance to do so. Customers\nmust receive a welcome email when they sign up or subscribe to your travel\nlist or platform.\n\nWelcome emails are reported to have an open rate of 91.43%. They can include\nvideos, exclusive deals, a sign-up form, or simply a kind greeting to begin\nthe client relationship on the right note. An eye-catching visual, along with\ncompelling content, is all that makes the difference and sets the tone for\nfurther communication.\n\nYou can make your welcome email more appealing by:\n\n  * Presenting your core values\n  * Providing a special discount offer\n  * Including a video tour of popular travel destinations\n\n### **2\\. Segment Your Demography**\n\nCustomers with similar traits can be grouped together via segmentation. For\nexample, you may segment your email list based on client interest, location,\npurchase history, customer type, and other factors.\n\nTo get more demographic segmentation options, gather more information from the\naudience throughout the sign-up process. However, be cautious with this\nbecause soliciting too much information may deter individuals from signing up\nat all.\n\nBy doing this, you can easily configure your campaigns and guarantee that each\nmessage is relevant to every reader. Engagement will increase when you send\nemails that speak to the subscriber\u2019s specific travel needs and wants. After\nall, studies suggest that segmented email marketing generates a click-through\nrate that is 90.7% greater than non-segmented efforts.\n\n### **3\\. Automate Emails for Fast Response Times**\n\nWhen time is of the essence in travel, automated emails can help you respond\nquickly and accurately to customer inquiries.\n\nFor instance, when a customer books a ticket, you can send an automated email\nto confirm their booking. You can also automate emails for customer feedback\nsurveys, promotional offers and discounts, loyalty points reminders, and more.\nThese are not only time-saving but also cost-effective.\n\n**Another Example of Automated Emails** is travel emails during the holiday\nseason. It\u2019s the textbook definition of doing the right thing at the right\ntime. Readers are in the holiday mood and ready to travel around with their\nloved ones.\n\nSo automating the delivery of holiday-centric email designs, giving them\nspecial packages or limited-time offers, or telling them which destination is\nideal for visiting based on past purchases can go a long way to boost\nengagement.\n\n### **4\\. Be Generous With Travel Ideas**\n\nProviding consumers with authentic information about possible travel\ndestinations will engage them and build curiosity. You can include \u2018Did You\nKnow Facts\u2019 about a particular city in your email campaigns, along with videos\nand pictures.\n\nThis will increase the chances of the customer getting back to inquire\nfurther. Travel ideas could include:\n\n  * City guides\n  * Tips on different types of travel\n  * Top places to eat listicles\n  * Things to do per month\n  * Hotels nearby\n\n### **5\\. Create and Market A Loyalty Program**\n\nA customer loyalty programme is a promotional tool that acknowledges and\ncompensates customers that engage with or make repeat purchases. Under this,\nyour business may award points or benefits that give out badges and promotes\nthem to greater levels of loyalty.\n\nGiving your customers an incentive beyond your products or services is a great\ntactic to make them return for more. Repeat customers are more profitable as\nthey spend 67% more than first-time customers. Free goodies, prizes, coupons,\nor special privileges like first access to new products are examples of\nbenefits that could lure customers in.\n\n### **6\\. Inspire Urgency with Limited Time Deals**\n\nCreate a sense of urgency by using scarcity to persuade customers to take\naction now. Inform them that your offer is only valid for a short period and\nthat you are doing something unique for them by providing a discount.\n\nThe tight deadline should be such that it encourages subscribers to act fast.\nInclude the time and date the offer expires. To make it look even more\ncreative, add an email countdown timer to the bottom of the email to remind\nthem to hurry up before time runs out.\n\n### **7\\. Capture and Share Testimonials**\n\nConsumers claim that online reviews influence their purchasing decisions 93%\nof the time. Create and send marketing emails that include endorsements from\nsatisfied customers. These could take the shape of videos, reels, images, or\nreviews in writing.\n\nFurthermore, you can also share a customer\u2019s experience while they are on the\ntrip with you. Encourage them to post about their experiences on social media\nand share them with a custom hashtag that uniquely signifies your brand. For\nexample, if you\u2019re a tour operator, create a hashtag like \u2018travellingwithXYZ\u2019,\nwhere XYZ is your brand\u2019s name.\n\nThis will create a sense of community and bring them closer to your brand.\nPeople are more likely to trust your services if they see social proof of\nsatisfied customers. By doing this, you build your readers\u2019 trust in your\nbrand, making them opt for your holiday package over your competitors.\n\n### **8\\. Include Videos to Showcase Travel Experiences**\n\n60% of travellers who watch videos on social media use them to guide their\ndecisions, whether they pick a tour operator to book with or a destination to\nvisit.\n\nAs a travel and tourism brand, you can leverage videos that tell stories about\npositive customer experiences to win over your audience and ultimately\ngenerate leads.\n\nFocus on the story you are conveying. By creating a captivating narrative, you\nwill be able to engage viewers on an emotional level. The more engaging your\nstory is, the more likely your viewers will take action.\n\nYou can find free and affordable stock videos that you can use to showcase the\nbeauty of a destination or life on board a cruise. Alternatively, you can\ncreate your own videos and add them to your email.\n\nWhatever the case, remember that timing is everything. According to research,\nyou generally have7 seconds to create an impression on a customer before their\nattention is diverted, and you risk losing them. Hence, strive to create short\nvideos that are captivating enough to keep the viewer engaged until the CTA.\n\nIf you already have a long video ready to go, consider breaking it into\nsmaller, more attention-grabbing chunks of content.\n\n### **9\\. A/B Test Your Subject Lines**\n\nA/B testing allows you to assess how version A of something \u2013 for example,\nyour email subject line \u2013 performs compared to version B. This test helps you\nto identify which version of the subject line will get a higher open rate.\nThrough this, you can determine what works best for your target audience.\n\nUp to 50% of your chosen contacts will receive an email with the subject line\nA, while an equal number will receive an email with the subject line B.\n\nThe email subject line that has received the most opens after a predefined\nperiod of time is deemed the winner. The remaining contacts who weren\u2019t\nincluded in the A/B test population are automatically emailed the winning\nsubject line.\n\nA/B testing is an effective tool that removes ambiguity from what will\nintrigue customers and gives tangible data to back up your decisions.\n\n### **10\\. Always Opt for Mobile-friendly Email Designs**\n\nA mobile-friendly approach to email design ensures an adequate user experience\non small screens. This prevents the user from zooming in and out to view\ncontent. They also make it easy to navigate emails from a mobile phone.\n\nOptimizing emails for smartphones requires the same consideration as designing\na mobile-responsive website and booking process, which you have likely already\nbeen working on.\n\nGiven that nearly two-thirds of travel customers use their smartphones in\nevery part of their journey, including the booking process, you can no longer\nignore the importance of mobile-friendly emails.\n\nTo do this, you can:\n\n  * Include a single-column layout with images,\n  * Use buttons and CTAs that are large enough to click on without needing to zoom in\n  * Ensure the loading time of emails is less than 2 seconds.\n\nWhen designing emails, it is also essential to consider the end-users\u2019 devices\nand operating systems. You can use an email marketing platform to test emails\non different devices and browsers before sending out the final version.\n\n### **11\\. Offer Customized Deals (based on browsing data and preferences)**\n\nThere is no denying that customized deals improve customer engagement and\nboost sales. They show customers that you are paying attention to their needs\nand appreciate that they have chosen your brand for their travel needs.\n\nYou can begin by collecting information about their interests and browsing\nhistory to offer customised deals. For instance, if you collect data about\ncustomers\u2019 browsing habits, you will know what type of holidays they would be\ninterested in and offer deals tailored to their needs.\n\nYou can also customize your deals with customer preference data from previous\nbookings. For instance, if customers book a certain type of accommodation or\ndestination on multiple occasions, you can offer them special discounts for\ntheir next booking.\n\n### **12\\. Leverage A Winning Email Design Philosophy**\n\nYour email design should be clean and professional, with images that grab\nattention. The layout should remain consistent to ensure familiarity. Remember\nthat consistency builds trust and makes your emails more recognizable.\n\nUse visuals to increase engagement, such as high-quality images highlighting a\ndestination\u2019s or hotel\u2019s features. Also, keep an eye on the text-image ratio\nto ensure that emails are easy to read.\n\nFinally, make sure your calls-to-action (CTAs) are clear and concise. It is\nessential to make the most of your limited space using effective CTAs, so\ncustomers know what to do.\n\nBy leveraging a winning email design philosophy, you can ensure that customers\nretain their interest in your emails and move through the conversion funnel of\nyour booking process.\n\n## **Types of Emails You Can Use for Travel Marketing**\n\n### **1\\. The Warm Welcome**\n\nWelcome emails have the highest delivery, open, and click-through rates. Your\nwelcome email should thank your audience for associating themselves with your\nbrand.\n\nIt must be warm, inviting, and informative. As soon as subscribers sign up,\nsend them a welcome email to let them know who you are, the brand\u2019s mission\nand what to expect from your business.\n\nIt is a part of onboarding emails that help users get acquainted with the\nbrand. In return, this will help the audience build trust in the organization.\n\nThey can also be set up to be automatically triggered. So when someone signs\nup, they get a welcome email right away.\n\nEngagement statistics degrade when they are not automated. Automated welcome\nemails may have an open rate of more than 85% and a click-through rate of 29%.\nOpen rates fall to 52% when delivered manually, while click-through rates fall\nto 12%.\n\nA double opt-in, an introduction to your company, and a reminder to set their\nemail preferences can all be included in a welcome email.\n\n### **2\\. The Newsletter**\n\nInformational newsletters work best. They are not salesy and don\u2019t push\nproducts and services beyond what subscribers would want.\n\n90/10 is one suggested formula for newsletters: 90% information and 10%\nadvertising. Less is more in the appropriate proportions, and instructional\ncontent will typically generate more engagement than product copy.\n\nThe newsletter is a flexible format that may be used to:\n\n  * Offer news about the travel industry\n  * Introduce a new benefit or service\n  * Announce your most recent packages and tour options\n  * And give travellers suggestions for weekend getaways.\n\nHere are 24 Newsletter Ideas to keep your audience engaged and generate\nrevenue.\n\n### **3\\. The Seasonal or Milestone Offer**\n\nUse a seasonal offer to remind people why they should be travelling. Seasonal\noffers, such as holiday packages and summer discounts, could help customers\nget in the mood to travel.\n\nYou can also use milestone offers to bring customers back. For example, if\nsomeone hasn\u2019t been on holiday for a while, you could email them a special\ndeal to entice them to book a future trip.\n\nPromotions centred around holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, or\neven long weekends are not uncommon. Campaigns for Diwali/ Christmas break and\nsummer vacations are also popular. These campaigns should always focus on the\ncustomer\u2019s interests first, as they will appreciate a chance to save money on\ntheir adventures.\n\nAlthough conversions are the apparent objective, the goal should be to develop\ncustomer relationships. Marketers should put the customer first and build\ntrust between them and their brand by communicating sincerely, offering\ndiscounts, and providing valuable information.\n\n### **4\\. The Booking Confirmation**\n\nA booking confirmation email simply confirms a customer\u2019s action. When a\ntraveller purchases your travel package or makes a booking through you, they\nshould receive a confirmation email.\n\nThese emails help affirm the customer\u2019s purchase and provide helpful\ninformation like check-in times, hotel locations, and other information they\nshould know. This can develop a trusting experience by establishing a\nrelationship and encouraging confidence from the minute they book.\n\nSetting up automated booking confirmation emails means guests will have all\nthe required information at their fingertips. Also, passengers frequently\nexamine these travel agency emails more than once; they have almost\nunrealistically high open rates.\n\nWith those open rates, pursuing more conversion and income opportunities is\nworthwhile. Consider cross-selling or upselling other travel packages or\nservices or including a list of your most travelled destinations at the end of\nsuch emails.\n\n### **5\\. The Informational Message**\n\nMore than 75% of customers believe that educational content influences\ndecision-making. The objective here is to present yourself as a caring and\nsupporting brand to your current and prospective clients.\n\nYou can forewarn travellers about adverse weather, tourist attractions, or\nscheduled events before they arrive. You could also help them with booking,\npacking, and other details of their trip. Other topics for informational\nemails can include safety tips, travel advice, and culinary recommendations.\n\nThe content should constantly be engaging while serving a purpose. It should\nnot be promotional but rather informative. You should focus on what the\ntraveller wants to know and develop content beyond what subscribers would\nexpect.\n\nThese emails should also be sent regularly, as customers tend to forget about\nthe offers, discounts, and services. You can also re-engage your customers\nwith ideas for their next trip through these messages.\n\n### **6\\. The Thank You Email**\n\nBeyond mere thankfulness, expressing gratitude will foster stronger customer\nrelations. Clients abandon a brand in roughly 68% of cases because they feel\nthe company doesn\u2019t care about them. Thank You emails can increase loyalty and\ndissuade them from searching elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, a 2% increase in client retention might have the same effect as\na 10% cut in costs.\n\nThanking a customer gives you a reason to interact with those who haven\u2019t been\naround in a while, allowing you to continue the dialogue with those who only\nfrequently or seasonally make purchases. Maintaining these dialogues will also\nenable you to establish your brand\u2019s personality, something customers will\nvalue.\n\nA Thank You email should be personalized and direct, with genuine content that\ndoesn\u2019t sound fake or robotic. It is also essential to consider the kind of\njourney a customer had and strive to make them feel appreciated for their\nbusiness.\n\nAlong with the thank you note, consider providing beneficial recommendations\nfor a product or service. It could be a list of the top sights in the city for\nwhich they recently made travel arrangements.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a special eBook on how to extend the life and uptime of the travel\ngear they just bought. Ensure the information is genuine, helpful, and\nvaluable to the reader. Alternatively, consider including a link to a survey\nto collect feedback that you can use to improve the services your brand\noffers.\n\n### **7\\. The Loyalty or Referral Program Email**\n\nFrequent travellers will appreciate being a part of an up-to-date loyalty\nprogram. You can design the scheme to be point-based or just offer flat\ndiscounts on specific services. Rewards for attaining milestones and birthday\nsurprises are other excellent features. A referral program driven by your\nloyalty program may also assist you in expanding your email list and\nincreasing your conversion rate.\n\nThis type of email aims to entice the customer with offers and exclusive\ndeals. They should feel like they are being rewarded for their loyalty and\nthat you value their patronage. Not only will this help build relationships\nthat last over time, but it can also encourage customers to recommend your\nservices to their friends and family.\n\n### **8\\. Notifications and Updates**\n\nCompared to advertising emails or newsletters, email notifications get greater\nattention since they include information that a user has asked for. They can\ninclude tailored offers and timely reminders about upcoming events or service\nchanges.\n\nOwing to the high open rate, the server\u2019s reputation is enhanced, and future\nemail deliverability is improved. Sharing updates will also help to reduce any\npotential adverse effects of the downsides of travelling, like flight delays\nor lost baggage, by providing the customer with information regarding their\nitinerary.\n\n### **9\\. Drip-fed Promotional Campaigns**\n\nAn Email drip campaign is a series of automatic emails sent to website\nvisitors after they perform a particular activity or activate a behavior-based\ntrigger. You can decide how many emails and at what rate to send them for any\nparticular activity. These emails can be personalized by including information\nabout the contact, such as their name and their actions.\n\n**Example:** You can set up abandoned cart emails for customers who add an\nitem to their online basket but do not complete the transaction. You may also\nset up an email series to remind customers of offers they may have missed.\n\n**Example:** You can also set browse abandonment emails for visitors who\nbrowse your products / services but dont make a purchase.\n\n**Example:** You can also set an upsell email series for clients who have\nbought a certain product / service.\n\n### **10\\. Survey Emails**\n\nSurvey emails are a great way to collect customer feedback and gain insight\ninto their needs. This will enable you to make focused improvements while\nmeasuring current customer satisfaction levels.\n\nBy understanding how satisfied customers are with your services and their\nexperiences when using them, you can come up with ways to improve. For\nexample, if many customers are dissatisfied with baggage handling or a lack of\nWi-Fi in their hotels, you can begin to look for ways to rectify the issue.\n\nAdditionally, customers are more likely to be responsive if their feedback is\nvalued. Sending out survey emails at regular intervals will help you stay on\ntop of the data, enabling you to make quick adjustments and increase customer\nsatisfaction.\n\nHere are some handy tips to follow:\n\n  * Survey emails should be well-crafted with clear objectives, incentives for participation, and simple language that is easy to understand.\n  * When including questions, try to keep them as objective and specific as possible.\n  * Asking open-ended questions can lead to more insightful answers and require more time to analyze.\n  * You should also consider the order of the questions and ensure they are relevant to each other. This will help keep participants engaged until the end of the survey.\n\n## **20 Travel Email Subject Lines That You Can Use**\n\nSubject lines are the holy grail of email marketing, as they are the first\nthing email recipients will see.
