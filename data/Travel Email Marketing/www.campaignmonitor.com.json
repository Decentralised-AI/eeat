In 2016, 1.2 billion people traveled\ninternationally and spent $1.5 trillion, according to the U.S. Travel\nAssociation.\n\nTo help captivate travelers, increase loyalty, and give reservations a boost,\nhere\u2019s a look at ten wildly successful email marketing campaigns that you can\nmimic this year. However, before we jump into those campaigns, let\u2019s first\ntalk about why email marketing is vital to the travel and hospitality sectors.\n\n## Why email marketing matters for hospitality\n\nThe travel and hospitality industries are two of the most competitive\nindustries, and, to succeed in these industries, you must make every\nexperience matter for each of your customers. While some marketing\nprofessionals may believe that the experience is in the stay, it\u2019s vital to\nremember that email marketing can and will play an essential role in your\ncustomer\u2019s overall experience.\n\nWhen it comes to driving revenue, email marketing is the single most\nbeneficial channel that can be utilized. With an average return on investment\nof $38 for every $1 spent, email marketing has the best ROI.\n\nHowever, to maximize your ROI, you need to make sure that you\u2019re staying on\ntop of your campaign\u2019s benchmarks and utilizing email marketing best\npractices, such as email personalization and A/B testing before sending.\n\n**_Source:_** _Campaign Monitor_\n\n###### Plan their path\n\nWith powerful segmentation, easily create customized journeys for your\nsubscribers.\n\nLearn More\n\nWhen it comes to maximizing your email marketing efforts, there are several\nkey things to keep in mind. The first is personalization.\n\nMore and more consumers simply expect personalized emails from brands they\nfrequent, and that includes the travel and hospitality industry. In fact,\npersonalized subject lines produce an average 65% open rate in the travel\nindustry, while personalized emails deliver a transactional rate 6 times\nhigher.\n\nPersonalization can come in several different forms, including:\n\n  * Subject lines\n  * Personalized travel suggestions\n  * Itinerary suggestions\n  * Travel content relevant to the user\u2019s browsing behavior\n\n**_Source:_** _Really Good Emails_\n\nThe best way to help you personalize your campaigns to the needs of your\nreaders is through email list segmentation. Email marketers have found email\ncampaigns that have been properly segmented see an average 760% increase in\nrevenue. Segment your lists in different ways, including:\n\n  * Gender\n  * Browsing history\n  * Purchase history\n  * Average spend amount\n  * Travel time booked and more\n\nWhile personalization helps to intrigue your email subscribers into opening\nand skimming your email messages, it\u2019s the design and choice of images that\nare going to make your emails stand out from the rest of the crowd. The\naverage individual remembers 80% of what they see, compared to only 20% of\nwhat they read. To encourage your readers to not only remember your brand, but\nengage with it, include a variety of beautiful images, videos, and maybe even\nsome interactive content to help them stay interested in what it is you have\nto say.\n\n## 10 tips for successful travel and hospitality email marketing campaigns\n\nUnderstanding just how vital email marketing can be to the travel and\nhospitality industry is only the first step when it comes to developing your\nbrand\u2019s email marketing strategy. The next step is to start developing email\ncampaign ideas to send to those who\u2019ve opted into your email subscription.\n\nNeed help getting started? Here are 10 tips to help guide your planning\nprocess:\n\n### 1\\. Give travelers a warm welcome.\n\nWhen a traveler signs up for your emails, it\u2019s time to roll out the red\ncarpet. Send your new contact a welcome email with a warm greeting and\ninformation that encourages the subscriber to learn more about your brand.\n\nYou can automate welcome emails triggered to arrive in a subscriber\u2019s inbox\nimmediately following their signup. Research shows welcome emails that are\nsent in real time have an 88% open rate and a 29% click-through rate, which is\nsignificantly higher than welcome emails that are sent in batches that garner\n52% open rates and 12% click-through rates, according to Experian.\n\nHere\u2019s a great example of a welcome email sent by Fairmont Hotels to its new\nsubscribers. It encourages subscribers to check out destinations where\nFairmont Hotels are available:\n\n### 2\\. Provide travel inspiration.\n\nWith so many places to go, travelers need some inspiration. Research shows a\ngrowing number of travelers are looking to visit lesser known areas or non-\ntouristy locales, according to the 2016 Virtuoso Luxe Report.\n\nCreate and send emails that showcase exotic places to visit or little cities\nthat are off the beaten path.\n\nNo matter what destinations you tout, make sure you include awesome images to\ngo with it. Images not only draw attention, but they also help travelers\nimagine themselves sitting under a palm tree or touring the streets of a city.\n\nFlight Centre does a great job inspiring subscribers with these newsletter-\nlike emails that showcase great destinations (with compelling images) at a low\nprice.\n\n**Pro tip** : The secret to success for these emails is that Flight Centre\nuses data they have about their customers with dynamic content to deliver\ndeals that\u2019ll appeal to preferences, prior purchases, and web browsing\nbehaviors.\n\n### 3\\. Personalize travel ideas and deals.\n\nWhile sending emails filled with fun travel destinations is a great start, you\ncan up your email game by personalizing those emails, like we saw in the\nFlight Centre email.\n\nA personalized email is more relevant to a subscriber, which makes him or her\nmore likely to open it and click through.\n\nTo personalize emails, you should capture information from your subscribers or\nuse data from other third-party apps like your booking app, ecommerce app, or\nyour CRM. Every piece of information you gain provides more insight into your\ncustomer and gives you the ability to provide customized travel offers.\n\nCheck out Campaign Monitor\u2019s latest acquisition, which will make this easier\nthan ever.\n\nDuring the email sign up process, Air Canada asks new subscribers to tell them\ntheir home airport and what destinations they\u2019re interested in. Using this\ninformation, the company sends promotions that are relevant to the\nsubscriber\u2019s interests.\n\nThe flight deals depart from the subscriber\u2019s home airport\u2014which, in this\ncase, is Montreal\u2014and go to destinations that the subscriber is specifically\ninterested in.\n\n### 4\\. Provide gift ideas on holidays.\n\nCase Study\n\n##### With hyper-personalized emails, Bluetent experiences huge wins in the\nhospitality space.\n\nLearn how\n\nWhen a holiday rolls around, send travel ideas. People are always hunting for\na great gift, so why not encourage them to think outside of the gift-giving\nbox?\n\nFlight Centre sent its subscribers an email on Mother\u2019s Day that said, \u201cBrunch\nis nice, but a trip is better.\u201d It\u2019s humorous, timely, and, most importantly,\nit could encourage two bookings\u2014not just one.\n\nIn this example, subscribers can enter to win a Mother\u2019s Day trip by giving\nfeedback. You can try that, or just send a promotional email on a holiday of\nyour choice.\n\n### 5\\. Provide testimonials.\n\nTravelers aren\u2019t just scouring the web for the most affordable trip; they\u2019re\nalso reading reviews. Ninety-three percent of travelers worldwide say their\nbooking decisions are influenced by online reviews, according to research from\nTripAdvisor.\n\nSince travelers are so dependent on reviews, why not help them out? Consider\ncreating an email that has several testimonials from happy customers and give\nsubscribers a link to read more.\n\nFairmont Hotels sends this testimonial email with a CTA that leads subscribers\nto read stories from real guests.\n\n### 6\\. Encourage travelers to join your loyalty program.\n\nLoyalty is a hard nut to crack in the travel and hospitality business.\nTravelers tend to search for the best deals rather than favor a specific\nbrand. However, if you have a rewards program, you can use it to encourage\nloyalty and repeat business.\n\nResearch shows members of a loyalty program generated 12 to 18% more revenue\nfor a brand than non-members did in 2016, according to Accenture.\n\nSend current subscriber\u2019s emails that focus on the program and its benefits.\nInclude a call to action that leads subscribers to an easy signup form. Here\u2019s\nan email from Fairmont Hotels that does exactly that:\n\n### 7\\. Give loyalty members incentives to travel.\n\nAfter attracting subscribers to your loyalty program, you can send emails that\nare specific to this niche. Consider segmenting this list into smaller groups\nbased on buying behavior, popular destinations, or location.\n\nBy segmenting your list, you can provide relevant travel ideas and incentives\nthat encourage travelers to take action.\n\nFor instance, you can email subscribers in Los Angeles a travel deal that\ndeparts out of LAX or give members double points for making a reservation.\n\nBritish Airways offers its loyalty members a chance to double their air miles\nby booking a flight in the next 45 days. The email even includes the member\u2019s\npoints status in the email.\n\nBy using email to promote its loyalty program, British Airways can incentivize\nmore travelers to book a trip.\n\n### 8\\. Provide access to experiences.\n\nTravelers are looking for an experience, not just a destination. That\u2019s why\nit\u2019s important to promote activities that are available to travelers. By\nfocusing on the journey and not just the destination, you can create memorable\ncustomer experiences.\n\nFor instance, don\u2019t just promote great rates on a room; promote all of the\nservices that are available at your hotel as well. Appeal to the business\ntraveler with an email promoting your business center or tell families about\nthe Olympic-sized pool that\u2019s sure to keep the kids entertained.\n\nThink of ways to give travelers a unique experience like Virgin Experience\nDays does with this email that offers a chance at virtual reality skydiving.\n\n### 9\\. Offer a limited-time deal.\n\nSeventy-six percent of business travelers and 70% of leisure travelers book\nwith a specific brand because of price, according to Google.\n\nConsidering the priority of great pricing, send emails to your subscribers\nthat give them the chance to take a great trip for an unbeatable price. Show\nsubscribers how sweet these deals are by putting a time limit on them.\n\nThe tight deadline should encourage subscribers to act fast. Flight Centre\nused this idea in a recent email that offered cheap deals to New York City. To\nconvey this limited time offer, Flight Centre added a countdown clock to the\nbottom of the email.\n\n### 10\\. Give travelers a chance at spontaneity.\n\nIt takes the average traveler 45 days to book a vacation, according to\nresearch from Expedia. However, not every traveler invests that kind of\nplanning time.\n\nIn fact, some travelers are looking to get away quickly. Give subscribers the\nchance to take a spontaneous trip with a can\u2019t-resist email offer. Flight\nCentre sent this email to subscribers with a link to last-minute vacations\nthat start at $530. Read all about how Flight Centre increased their click-\nthroughs by 57%.\n\n## Wrap up\n\nWhile competition in the travel and hospitality industry is fierce, all of\nthese tips are designed to help you attract and retain subscribers. Sending a\nvariety of emails that focus on deals, destinations, fun experiences, and\nloyalty programs gives you a competitive edge and keeps travelers coming back\nfor more.\n\nSome email marketing campaigns that you should consider adding to your email\nmarketing strategy can include:\n\n  * Welcome series\n  * Travel inspiration\n  * Personalized travel deals\n  * Gift suggestions for the holiday season\n  * User testimonials\n  * Loyalty program invitations\n  * Loyalty programs incentives to travel\n  * Access to experiences\n  * Limited-time deals\n  * Offer chances for spontaneity\n\n_**Ready to take your travel and hospitality email marketing to the next\nlevel?Schedule your live demo today and see what Campaign Monitor can do for\nyou.**_\n\n### Travel comms made easy\n\nSimplify your travel and hospitality emails with our global team and unique\nintegrations.\n\nLearn more\n\nThis blog provides general information and discussion about email marketing\nand related subjects.
