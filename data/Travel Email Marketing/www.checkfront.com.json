While creating\na memorable tour is likely at the top of your list, the guest experience\nbegins long before the tour happens. And one way to set the scene ahead of\ntime is with email marketing.\n\nAs one of the most direct methods of communicating with your audience, email\nmarketing for tourism is key for connecting with your guests before and after\ntheir experience.\n\nBut, how do you use emails in a way that speaks to your audience? Here, I\u2019ll\nshare examples and tactics for making email marketing a powerful tool in your\ntour business.\n\n## Define your email marketing goals\n\nAs a tour operator, you may be looking for ways to connect with your guests on\na deeper level to encourage more bookings and once-in-a-lifetime experiences.\nWhat does this look like? Inviting travelers to connect over email takes the\nrelationship a step further, helping to build the relationship between\ntravelers and your brand.\n\nWith shorter attention spans, tailored email content is a better way to\nconnect with your audience because the emails feel like they\u2019re coming from a\nreal person with a wealth of experience \u2014 and that\u2019s you!\n\nWhile every person who visits your website may not be ready to book the first\ntime they visit, they might appreciate free, valuable information. And since\ntravelers prefer to book with companies they trust, you can help to foster\nthis feeling for guests well in advance of booking.\n\nSo, how do you come up with goals for evaluating your email marketing efforts?\n\n### 1\\. Ask what you want to accomplish\n\nDevelop a better connection with website visitors by providing free,\ninsightful and helpful information to earn trust? Share exciting and recent\nupdates about your business? Promote your latest or a new activity or\nexperience? Increase conversion rates?\n\n### 2\\. Create a clear plan of action  \n\nDetermine frequency of emails (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly). From there,\ndiscover who\u2019s opening and engaging your messages through email analytics.  \n\n### 3\\. Evaluate your efforts\n\nExplore whether segmentation of your email subscribers makes sense with your\nemail subscribers. Is there an opportunity to delve into two different groups\nto provide the most relevant information? Experiment with different types of\ncontent to see what gets the most engagement from your subscribers\n\n## How to use email marketing for tourism\n\nCurating an email marketing strategy allows you to remain front of mind with\nguests, loyal customers and website visitors. Look at your email marketing\nefforts as a way of warming up your leads to help build trust which is key\nbefore people decide to book with you.\n\nFocus on delivering valuable and engaging information, even if it\u2019s a small\namount at first. Since most people scan emails and online, include images and\nshort headlines to pinpoint readers towards what they may find useful.\n\nThe customer journey is longer and the competition is tougher, which is why\nhaving a direct channel to  travelers is so important. Email marketing is one\nof the best ways for nurturing interested travelers and heightening their\nawareness of your brand.\n\n### 1\\. Optimize your emails for smartphones\n\nPeople expect emails to be mobile-friendly. By designing your emails to be\nresponsive, smartphone users will be able to tell from a quick glance whether\nthere\u2019s something worth exploring further.\n\nWith more travelers using their mobile devices to research and plan trips,\nit\u2019s vital to optimize your emails for mobile. Another opportunity to connect\nwith your audience is through tour SMS messages.\n\nUsers can opt in to receive text messages that direct them to relevant\ninformation, like your tourism newsletter. Include links to your social media\nchannels where you can share and repurpose the email content.\n\n### 2\\. Tailor your email content to the recipient\n\nMore hyper-personalization is infiltrating inboxes because it heightens email\nclick-through rates. Subscribers who receive an email personalized to them are\nmore likely to open the email.\n\n### 3\\. Complement other marketing strategies\n\nEmail marketing has one of the best ROI (return on investment) and complements\nother marketing strategies you use in promoting your tours and activities. If\nyou publish a new post or gather some amazing photos from a recent tour,\nenlighten your guests and share the latest content to fuel their desire to\ntravel.\n\n## What content to include in your email marketing for tourism\n\nWhen you consider email as a method for current and future customers to keep\nin touch.

This is an ideal outlet to warm\nup your audience by offering a few tips for assisting travelers as they\nprepare for their trip. Share who you are as a tour business and what you want\ncustomers to experience when they visit you.\n\n### 2\\. Spotlight your team\n\nPeople like to connect on a personal level. And they love behind-the-scenes\ncontent. When you show your face and use the first names of people on your\nteam, it helps to form a better connection overall. Since booking requires\npeople to have trust in you, sharing photos of yourself along with staff\nmembers will help to build on this.\n\n### 3\\. Highlight guest stories and experiences\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good story? Guest photos and testimonials in your email\nmarketing give future guests a sense of what to expect along with a burst of\nexcitement for what they can look forward to.\n\nReaders appreciate guest reviews because of their relatability. If your guests\nalready share their experience on social media, re-purpose this content with a\nhashtag that represents your tour company along with guest photos to inspire\nfuture guests.\n\n### 4\\. Offer insider tips and guides\n\nKeep giving readers valuable content before they are ready to book with you as\na way of demonstrating your knowledge. As a tour operator, you\u2019ll already have\na sense of the types of guests that typically book with you and what they\nappreciate as far as recommendations.\n\nShare local sightseeing suggestions, restaurant recommendations and even ideal\npacking lists based on your locale. If you\u2019re limited on ideas, share\narticles, weather information or recommendations from other sources, all\nlinked within your email.\n\n### 5\\. Promote new experiences  \n\nDo you have some new activities you\u2019re excited to share with your guests? Your\nemail marketing is the perfect outlet for announcements, events and updates.\nPromote new activities guests might be interested in through photos and video\ncontent.  \n\nShare special deals exclusive to newsletter subscribers on your email list.\nSpeak to their fear of missing out by using statements like \u201cStay connected\nand hear about promotions first through our e-news.\u201d\n\n### 6\\. Direct readers to recent blog posts\n\nMake your tour company more credible by sharing specific content your audience\nwon\u2019t easily find elsewhere. Plus, helpful articles and tips sent through\nemail marketing will save your readers time by not having to do all the\nresearch themselves.\n\nConsider the possible questions guests might ask. Your role as a tour operator\nis to be there every step of the decision-making process and give them reasons\nto trust you. Here are some questions you can answer:\n\n\u201cWhere can I go for dinner after my tour in [location]?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the best times to visit [location] to avoid crowds?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this [activity/tour/lodging] child or pet-friendly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I book a private tour?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are your cancellation policies?\u201d\n\n### 7\\. Ask for guest feedback\n\nEach of the emails you send out to your subscribers should make the reader\nfeel appreciated, informed and inspired. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a one-way\nchannel. Invite guests to connect with you through your emails.\n\nPart of your email marketing for tourism strategy should be to communicate\nwith guests on a regular basis so they are more likely to engage with you.\nThis helps to drive customer loyalty and increase repeat bookings along with\npositive guest reviews.\n\n## Types of marketing emails that provide value for your tour guests\n\n### Booking confirmation email\n\nWhen your customers book with you, whether it\u2019s by phone, online or in-person,\nthey expect to receive an email confirmation. By sending an email immediately\nafter a guest books, you give them the impression that every email you send\nwill be chock-full of value.\n\nWhen you\u2019re writing your booking confirmation email template, you\u2019ll want to\ninclude the essential information a guest will be looking for immediately\nafter booking, which will likely include:\n\n  * Date(s) Booked\n  * Guest Names \n  * Location\n  * Invoice\n  * Number of guests\n  * Cancellation and refund policies\n\n### Follow up email\n\nA follow up email can be viewed as a way of closing the loop and reminding\nguests to share their feedback post-experience. These can be sent 1-2 days\nafter the guest has completed their booking.\n\n### Nurture emails\n\nWhen a website visitor initially signs up to receive emails from you, they\nwill expect some kind of email confirmation that welcomes them to your brand.\n\nFrom here, your new subscriber will enter what\u2019s commonly known as a nurture\ncampaign or a welcome sequence, where they\u2019ll receive a handful of emails\nproviding helpful information, promotions and updates. Make a point to offer\ntwo-way communication with your readers.\n\nIf you decide to use personalization tokens, for the reader it will feel more\nlike the email is coming from a human. Welcome emails are typically friendly,\ninformative and designed to confirm an action taken by the recipient.\n\nNurture emails are designed to walk people through potential hesitations\naround booking.

Aim to schedule reservation reminders to\nland in a guest\u2019s inbox between a week to a few days before their trip is\nscheduled. These emails can also add a bit of last-minute excitement for a\nguest with an upcoming booking.\n\n### Thank you email\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been on the receiving end of a thank you note, you know it\nfeels good to be acknowledged. Thank you emails are designed to express\ngratitude to your guests. And customers appreciate receiving a thank you note\nfor the tour after the experience.\n\nIf you can provide guests with a token of thanks like free photos from the\ntour or a personalized note detailing something remarkable from their tour,\nyou\u2019ll stand out that much more in their mind. Aside from making your guests\nfeel appreciated, the benefit for you, as the experience provider, is that a\npost-tour thank you email can remind guests to share a review within a quicker\ntime frame.\n\n### Tourism newsletters  \n\nYour tourism newsletter should contain easy-to-read, useful information\ntailored to your audience, with a mix of both educational and promotional\ncontent. Place your best content at the top of your travel newsletter,\nfollowed by fun facts, images and questions that people can\u2019t help but click.\n\n For guests, a tourism newsletter gives them a way of staying up-to-date and\nbeing the first to know about special deals, events and promotions.
