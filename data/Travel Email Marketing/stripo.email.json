Types of marketing emails a travel industry needs today \n  5. Final thoughts \n\nCancel\n\nThe past couple of years have been quite challenging for tourism because of\nCovid restrictions. Now when people are willing to make up for the missed\ntravel opportunities, it is important not to miss your chance as a business to\ngain new customers and return old ones.\n\nTravel email marketing is a nice way to notify your customers about open\nborders, interesting package deals, and new options for traveling inside your\ncountry.\n\nUse prebuilt email templates for the Tourism industry to build professional\ntravel emails in just a few clicks\n\nBrowse\n\n\n\n## What is the role of email marketing in the Tourism and Travel industry?\n\nTo provide your clients with the best service at all stages of cooperation,\nfrom the subscription form to the thank you email. Communication via different\nchannels is the only way to sell such a high-priced product as a vacation\npackage in 2022 and 2023.\n\nTo see photos with smiles on your client\u2019s faces when they are making it near\nTimes Square in NY or Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in Barcelona, you have to\nhold their hands from the first email till the time they make it to the\nairport and even further.\n\n(Source: Email from Gap 360)\n\n### What exactly you can do with the right email marketing strategy:\n\n  * start relations with appropriate and well-designed welcome emails to show benefits;\n\n  * interest potential customers who subscribed to your news and updates and keep loyal ones who already purchased your service;\n\n  * share valuable information on the upcoming trip, such as contact for emergencies, interesting sights to see, seasonal events, etc., to be a good assistant and retain customers;\n\n  * give clients exclusive deals and flash sales by designing creative campaigns to help your tourism business;\n\n  * share with potential customers feedback and user-generated content from your audience to show that they can trust you;\n\n  * give an opportunity to easily find details on deal packages by adding links to relevant information in emails;\n\n  * offer personalized emails based on email segmentation to encourage customer journey and boost sales.\n\nUse other marketing moments you can think of to raise a number of new\ncustomers and transform them into returning customers.\n\nSo, travel email marketing is a must today. And this is what we will talk\nabout in this article \u2014 all the best practices and examples of email marketing\ncampaigns.\n\n## Tips on how to create powerful email campaigns for the travel and tourism\nindustry\n\n### 1\\. Stay brand consistent\n\nWork with a neat and distinguishable brand identity. Use your brand colors,\nlogo, fonts, and visual elements so your new customers will get accustomed to\nyou faster and your old ones will remember all perks of your services.\n\nUse this template\n\n### 2\\. Create a compelling subject line\n\nOne more crucial element of email marketing is a correct subject line. We've\nprepared a few examples of such lines:\n\n  * The ultimate Africa adventure guide \u2014 FlipBoard;\n\n  * Travel essentials\u2014pack less, do more \u2014 Patagonia;\n\n  * Your last chance to book summer in California \u2600\ufe0f \u2014 Outsite;\n\n  * Your early-access invitation to Napa Valley is here \u2014 Aero;\n\n  * Don't waste a moment this summer \u2014 Aero;\n\n  * Labor Day staycay \u26f1\ufe0f \u2014 HotelTonight;\n\n  * Introducing Our Brand New Savings Pass! \u2014 Fort Myers;\n\n  * \ud83c\udfdc 4 reasons to take the scenic route \u2014 Vacasa.\n\n### 3\\. Use different channels\n\nConnect email marketing with social media channels by placing links to your\nprofiles in the email's footer, like in the example below.\n\nUse this template\n\n## Word of advice\n\nRemember a simple rule \u2014 delegate any possible job. Instead of wasting time on\ncreating the same email elements repeatedly, use Stripo's Smart Elements; use\nprebuilt email templates; set up automated emails with a suitable email\nmarketing software.\n\nSpeed up email production with Stripo\n\nGet started\n\n## Types of marketing emails a travel industry needs today\n\n### 1\\. Subscription from\n\nOf course, this is not an email. But how will people receive promo emails if\nthey do not sign up for your newsletter?\n\n(Source: Travel Design USA, Inc.)\n\nYou can also offer bonuses for signing up for your emails. For example, you\ncan provide something like \u201cFill in the forms below and get a short-list of\nthe most available travel directions for now\u201d or \u201cSubscribe and receive a\ncheck-list \u201cHow to travel 5 countries for $XXX in 5 days\u201d.\n\n(Source: Gap 360)\n\nI guess you got what I mean. Motivate them with things they need.\n\n### 2\\. Welcome email\n\nNot mentioning this type of email in travel email marketing is hard. After\ngreeting your subscribers, it is nice to share some information on the\nbenefits a person would get from being subscribed to you.\n\n(Source: Email from Hipmunk)\n\nIn Travel agency welcome emails, you can ask them about their preferences.\nWould they like to travel only by train or plane is preferable? What type of\nrest do they prefer? Or what are their price limits? This information will\nallow you to segment your contact list to make travel emails more personalized\nand soothe communication.\n\nOr you can do it in a promo email.\n\n(Source: Hilton Honors)\n\n#### Important:\n\nAfter users connect with you via a subscription form and share their email\naddress with you, be sure to ask for their consent, meaning they need to\nverify their email address and willingness to receive promo emails from you.\nThis is a very important thing to do, called Double Opt-in.\n\nFor more information on how to build subscription confirmation emails, please\nrefer to our \u201cSubscription confirmation emails\u201d blog post.\n\n### 3\\. Promo emails\n\nPromo emails are the drivers of a travel email marketing strategy.\n\nUse this template\n\n\u201cMake a Customer, Not a Sale,\u201d said Katherine Barchetti, retail business\nspecialist. Understanding this quote is how to get successful sales and\nincrease your clients' LTV (Lifetime Value).\n\nLet me show you a few of the best practices you can use to make your promo\nemails competitive.\n\n#### Tip 1. Share several offers and many photos at a time\n\nYou never know what the customers need right at the moment. Even if clients\ntell you about their preferences, you must add a few other offers below the\none they prefer. In case they change their plans and wishes.\n\n(Source: Email template from Stripo)\n\nUse as many pictures as possible when you display one place from one offer.\nShow the best of this location.\n\n#### Tip 2. Remember about Seasonal email marketing\n\nSend the emails related to dates, national holidays, cultural events, etc.;\nadd a promo code for loyal customers. This tip became a tool in the email\nmarketing travel industry.\n\nPeople like to travel even for a few days to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, New\nYear, Christmas, Independence Day (or other important days in other\ncountries), and it is a nice time to use it for your advance.\n\n(Source: Email from Universal Orlando Resort)\n\n#### Tip 3. Use video in travel emails\n\nVideos can be worth a thousand words.\n\nBe sure to actively use them in your travel email marketing.\n\nUse our prebuilt emails with saved slots for a video to engage customers\n\nUse this template\n\n#### Tip 4. Stick to Clarity\n\nTry to keep it short when it comes to using words.\n\nPicture \u2014 short description \u2014 price. Briefly written information with good\nfont and background + juicy pictures that cause emotions is everything you\nneed.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.\n\n(Source: Really Good Emails)\n\n#### Important:\n\nYou can easily build interactive banners or AMP image carousels with Stripo.\n\n#### Tip 5. Offer discounts on special occasions\n\nBe sure to congratulate your customers on their birthdays. Tell them how many\nplaces they have visited with your company and how many miles they have passed\nwith you. Or celebrate your anniversary, like a year from their first travel\nwith you.\n\nUse this template to remind your clients how lucky they are to have you\n\nUse this template\n\nAnd offer a discount for the next trip.\n\n#### Tip 6. Start sending your promo campaigns early\n\nOf course, we remember about Last Minute Deals, but many people like planning\nvacations in advance. You may help them out.\n\nFor example, if you want to sell the trip for May, it is better to begin the\ncampaign in Winter when people are thinking about how nice it would be to go\nsomewhere as soon as the warm days come.\n\nAt the same time, when the hot Summer ends, you can start on the Christmas\ncampaigns.\n\n(Source: Email from Universal Orlando Resort, sent on Jun 18)\n\n### 4\\. Booking confirmation email\n\nAlways notify customers that you have processed their orders and that their\nrooms/ tickets/ trips are saved.\n\nDon\u2019t make them nervous \u2014 send such emails immediately.\n\n(Source: Really Good Emails)\n\nAlso, success lies in a follow-up email, like a reminder email with valuable\ncontent for customers to refresh details.\n\n### 5\\. Abandoned cart email\n\nSuch emails are highly important for the email marketing travel industry.\nRemind people about their wishes and choices.\n\nPeople have different reasons or circumstances. They might have simply\nforgotten to complete the checkout because of being interrupted and then lost\nthe booking page link.\n\nThey also can be caught by the competitors, and you have to remind them of the\nadvantages of your offer.\n\n(Source: Really Good Emails)\n\nClients can doubt. Of course, it happens. In this way, you have to ensure that\nyour offer is the best choice with the best price and quality.\n\n### 6\\. Emails with bonuses for trips or Membership emails\n\nEveryone likes bonuses, especially significant ones. Here are a few examples\nof how you can give rewards and get benefits.\n\n(Source: Hilton Honors)\n\nThis is a good way to make it possible for people to get something like a card\nthat collects vouchers, discounts, bonuses, and so on. Many airlines have a\nbonus system where miles are accumulated, and customers can use that in the\nfuture. You can come up with something similar using your imagination!\n\n### 7\\. Post-purchase emails\n\nCommunication with customers does not end with a purchase. Remember I wrote\nthat you must always hold your client's hand?\n\nWhat does it mean from an email marketing perspective?
