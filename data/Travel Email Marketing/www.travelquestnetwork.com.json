It's not like the old days when people contemplating a trip\nwould walk in the door of a brick-and-mortar travel agency. This still\nhappens, of course, but it's relatively rare. Today, the vast majority of\ntravelers book their trips and do their research online. There are many\ndigital tools for engaging with customers such as your website and social\nmedia pages. One of the best ways to stay in touch, however, is by email. With\nemail, you don't have to wait for people to visit your pages. You can\nproactively contact them and point them wherever you want them to go. Here are\n6 powerful email tactics for travel agents.\n\n### 1\\. Build Your List\n\nOne of the biggest email marketing challenges is to grow your list. There are\nquite a few ways to get subscribers.\n\n  * Use a reliable email marketing service such as MailChimp, Constant Contact, or AWeber. These and similar services, also known as autoresponders, provide many tools for automating your marketing: scheduling, subscription forms,  automated responses, newsletter templates, and more.\n\n  * Place subscription forms in visible places on your website and social media pages. You can test various placements and tactics such as exit popups on your site. Your Facebook page is another premium spot for your form. \n\n  * Give people a reason to subscribe. Offer benefits that match your specialty (e.g. \"To find the best value on Caribbean cruises, subscribe to my newsletter\"). You can also offer a lead magnet such as an e-book or report. Another idea is to offer a  promo code or discount on one of your services. \n\n### 2\\. Create a Branded Newsletter\n\nTo get maximum engagement, it's important to contact your subscribers\nregularly. Creating a newsletter helps you position yourself as an expert and\ngets people to expect your emails. You can also just send out messages\nregularly. A newsletter, however, has a higher perceived value and lets you\nbuild your brand. Give your newsletter a simple and straightforward name that\nhelps you brand yourself such as \"Sue's Travel Tips\") and include your logo.\nUsing an automated email service gives you access to many professional-looking\ntemplates.\n\nSome business owners find the idea of creating a newsletter daunting but\nthere's not much to it. You choose a template, set up a schedule (something\nelse you can do through your autoresponder/email service), and create your\ncontent. You don't have to write a long post or essay every time. Most\ncustomers are busy and therefore appreciate short and concise writing.\n\n### 3\\. Share Useful Information\n\nThe main goal of all your marketing is to get more bookings. However, the\nfocus of your email campaigns should be on providing useful information rather\nthan directly promoting your company. You can include offers in your emails,\nof course. however, you should also share tidbits such as:\n\n  * Destination Guides -Describe attractions, activities, and events in areas you cover. \n\n  * Timely Events - Talk about festivals, concerts, holiday celebrations. This overlaps with destinations but the focus can be different. For events, you might list things like Top Music Festivals in Europe, Most Exciting Carnival Celebrations, etc. \n\n  * General Travel Tips -Packing, locating the best fares, etiquette in different cultures, etc. \n\n  * Useful links. As we'll discuss below, it's best to send subscribers to your own site and other pages. However, you can also include useful links provided they aren't competitors. \n\nYou needn't worry about providing too much information so that people don't\nneed your services. Even when customers can do tasks themselves, they often\nappreciate the convenience of having it done for them. Thus, providing\ninformation on travel apps, airlines and cruises isn't going to stop people\nfrom booking with you. In fact, it might even help you as you're reminding\nthem how much research they'll have to do if they don't get help! At the same\ntime, you're demonstrating your thorough knowledge of the industry.\n\n### 4\\. Use Email to Boost Your Content Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is a powerful tool to enhance content marketing for travel\nagents. If you have a blog, for example, you should link to your latest posts\nin your emails. You can also send traffic to your Facebook page, videos,\narticles, and any other channels you may be using. Linking to your own content\nalso means you don't have to create tons of content for your newsletter. You\ncan simply entice people with a short summary of your latest content along\nwith a link.\n\n### 5\\. Segment Your Email List\n\nCreating a single email list and newsletter is a good first step. However, as\nyour list grows, it's even more powerful to segment your list and send the\nmost appropriate messages to each subscriber. Segmentation isn't that\ncomplicated if you're using an autoresponder. For example, you can set up\ndifferent campaigns associated with different opt-ins. You might set up a\nsequence of emails to promote tours to different destinations. Some of your\nreaders might be more interested in the Caribbean, others in Europe or Asia.\n\n### 6\\. Make Your Email Marketing Mobile-Friendly\n\nMore and more people are using mobile devices. You need to be prepared for\nthis and make sure your marketing is mobile-friendly. Not only are travelers\nusing smartphones and tablets for research and booking, but they also use them\nat every stage of their journeys. For example, 64% of travelers now check into\nflights using mobile devices. There are two main ways to leverage the mobile\nrevolution.\n\n  * Make sure your emails are easy to view on mobile devices. Keep email copy short and concise. On a similar note, keep subject lines brief so they don't get cut off.  Limit the use of images as these can slow down the experience for mobile users. \n\n  * Reach out to customers while they're traveling. They're likely to open your messages from their phones and may appreciate add-ons you can offer. For example, someone on a trip may want to book a tour or buy a city pass for transportation and entertainment. \n\n### Email Marketing: A Powerful Tool for Travel Agents\n\nThese email strategies are all helpful for travel agents who want to grow\ntheir business and connect with more clients. Email marketing can complement\nall of your other digital marketing strategies. It helps you acquire new\nclients and keep in touch with existing ones. With an email list, you can\nestablish your expertise, send traffic to your website, and remind travelers\nto take advantage of your latest offers. You'll also find that the benefits of\nemail marketing increase over time as your list grows.\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail*\n\nWebsite\n\nComment*\n\n__\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * WorldVia Adds Laura DeVeiga as Director of Its Branch Program\n  * WorldVia Reaches Celebrity Cruises\u2019 Top 50 Club\n  * 4 Ways to Leverage Technology to Grow Your Travel Business\n\n### Categories\n\n  * All Categories\n  * marketing\n  * editorial\n  * finance & legal\n  * press release\n  * sales\n  * solopreneur\n  * travel\n\n##### Follow Us\n\n__ __ __\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Newsroom\n  * Careers\n  * Site Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n\u00a9 2024 WorldVia\u00ae Travel Quest Network | CA 2073234-40 | IA 924 | WA 602864166\n| NV 240000021\n\nWebinar\n\nTitle of my webinar with lorem ipsum dolor sit amen comes here\n\nWed, 22 Sep 2022, 22:22 AM\n\nView more dates\n\nRegister\n\nStarts in 100 days\n\nThis webinar has expired!\n\nThis webinar has already taken place.
