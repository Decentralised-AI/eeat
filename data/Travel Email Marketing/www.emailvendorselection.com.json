So it\u2019s time you start taking full advantage of\nit. The ticket to success lies in an email marketing strategy that will grow\nyour big or small business.\n\nBut how? To master email marketing in Travel, you need to bring two things:\n\n**1\\. The right strategy and way to use email marketing**  \nYour email marketing strategy will be like your roadmap to success. An\neffective travel email marketing strategy uses many types of email campaigns\ntogether. Allowing you to target customers in the best possible way. But how\nis this done?\n\n **2\\. The right partner**  \nThe marketer\u2019s secret weapon should be the email platform: the best ESPs allow\nyou to easily create and send emails. They let you integrate and automate your\nemail campaigns.\n\nIn this guide, we will see how these two fit together. We will walk through\nsome campaign examples that you should not miss in your travel and tourism\nemail strategy. With each, we provide details on what features you need from\nyour ESP to make them a success.\n\n **Chapters:**  \n1\\. Which emails are effective in Travel Industry?  \n2\\. Choosing the right email marketing software  \n3\\. Travel and Tourism emails not to miss in your strategy  \nNewsletters and scheduled emails  \nFlash Sales and timed offers  \nSeasonal Event emails  \n4\\. Email Automation and Lifecycle emails  \nWelcome Programs  \nFeedback emails  \nVIP and Loyalty Programs  \n\n## 1\\. Which types of emails are effective in Travel Industry?\n\nTravel and tourism companies are expected to offer a smooth customer\nexperience. This is why your best bet is to bring marketing, life-cycle, and\ntransactional emails to work together. Ideally, you need an email solution\nthat allows you to create and send all of them.\n\nHere is a quick overview of the different email types:\n\nMarketing Email\n\nLifecycle Email\n\nTransactional Email\n\nMarketing emails are mass messages sent out to all or targeted segments of\nyour subscribers.\n\nLifecycle emails are series of automated emails predefined according to where\nyour subscriber is.\n\nTransactional emails are triggered by an action taken by a specific user to\nguide their process.\n\nExamples:  \n* Flash Sales  \n* Newsletters  \n* Seasonal Events\n\nExamples:  \n* Welcome Emails  \n* Feedback Emails  \n* Loyalty Programs\n\nExamples:  \n* Booking Confirmations  \n* Password reset  \n* Cart Abandonment\n\n **Transactional and Marketing work together in your email strategy.**  \nSee these Trainline examples, for instance. Although easily recognizable as\ntransactional (left) and marketing (right), they have matching styles. This is\nthe first step.\n\nBy making sure your marketing and transactional emails have the same branding,\nyour customers will trust they are communicating with one company. A company\nthat has a clear and distinguishable brand identity.\n\nTransactional and many lifecycle emails are \u201cevent-triggered\u201d automations. The\ntravel and tourism industry has a proven high engagement with these types of\nemails.\n\nCustomers are eager to make sure their experience is as smooth (well\norganized) and enjoyable as possible and are more likely to open emails\nrelated to their purchase. This typically leads to greater engagement with\nemails related to the product or service being offered.\n\nCustomers expect (and read!) automated emails from airlines, hotels, booking\nsites, and tour operators because these provide information or ask them to\ncomplete their bookings, add profile details, or check in.\n\nWe will show you travel and tourism email campaign examples that you should\ninclude in your travel and tourism email strategy. With each, we highlight\nwhat you need from your ESP to make them a success.\n\nBut first, what should you look for in email marketing software for the travel\nindustry?\n\n## 2\\. The best email marketing software for the travel industry\n\nIn evaluating your email marketing software, there is nothing as handy as a\n\u201dpacking list\u201d with features your email marketing software needs to offer.\nRemember, email marketing is a powerful channel. The main decision will be to\nwhat degree an ESP allows you to build lasting relationships with your\ncustomers, drive conversions, and increase your ROI.\n\nHere is our \u201cpacking list\u201d of top must-haves for an ESP in the travel\nindustry.\n\n  *  **Email creation and design** : a powerful drag-and-drop editor to create your emails easily in a few minutes and a variety of customizable and fully responsive email templates.\n  * Email personalization for creating content that\u2019s specific to the individual.\n  * Email segmentation to target your contacts based on their travel preferences and profile.\n  * Responsive subscription widgets or integration to any of the best landing page builders. This is to build your contact list by obtaining full consent. These tend to work best when included in pages that provide value and content to visitors, such as blogs, landing pages, or resource pages.\n  * Structured and clear contact administration that allows you to manage your subscriber lists easily.\n  * A/B testing \u2013 to split test and optimize your campaigns.\n  * Can handle both transactional and marketing emails\n  * Detailed statistics that allow you to analyze and improve the newsletters you sent out.\n  * Strong marketing automation tools help you to manage planned customer/subscriber journeys.\n  * Integrations with your other apps and systems.  \nSome examples of useful integrations are:  \nCRM integration, allowing data to be used as quickly as possible after\npurchase and at points of key interactions (e.g. key flight information).  \nEventbrite \u2013 a global ticketing and event technology platform that allows\nevent organizers to plan, promote, and sell tickets to events; and  \nZapier, which can be used as a pipeline to several other useful integrations.\n\n  *  **GDPR compliant** your ESP must be GDPR compliant and have other certifications.\n  *  **And first-class deliverability** to ensure your emails reach the inbox.\n\nIt is not all about the email marketing software, the ideal ESP should also\nhave:\n\n  *  **References** and other clients in the travel industry.\n  *  **Industry knowledge** and email marketing best practices in travel and hospitality to share.\n  *  **Customer support** and account management at the level you require.\n\n## 3\\. Travel and Tourism emails not to miss in your strategy\n\nMarketing emails are vital for the travel and tourism industry, as they can\nhave a massive impact on the reader. The right marketing communication can\nconvince subscribers to book that holiday they\u2019ve been dreaming of for a long\ntime or inspire that last-minute booking.  \n\n### Newsletters and scheduled emails\n\nNewsletters are unmistakably core to any email marketing strategy, but\nespecially in the travel industry.\n\nFantasizing about city breaks and beach vacations is something we\u2019ve all done\nat some point. People may consider taking a vacation all year round, with\npeaks and dips, but we don\u2019t know exactly when the decision will be made.\nThat\u2019s why creating regular emails to keep in touch with them and promote your\ndestinations will allow you to entice your contacts and be there when they\nneed it.\n\nPeople won\u2019t book a trip every time they get your newsletter. But by sending\nout content that adds value and that they enjoy reading, you will keep them\ntop-of-mind, and they\u2019ll probably think of your company once they\u2019re ready to\nbook their trip.\n\n **Content to include in newsletters:**\n\n  * Enticing and beautiful images of the holiday destinations. This can be cities, places or beautiful sceneries \u2013 either professional or user-generated.\n  * Text that invites subscribers to take action and research or book that destination.\n  * Special offers that call upon readers to take action.\n  * Inspirational content that targets a specific destination so that readers can find out more.\n\nEvery ESPs will allow you to send newsletters, but there are specific features\nthat you want it to have to make your newsletter campaigns that much better.\nFor example, the handling of images.\n\n **Importance of visuals in travel email**  \nIt can\u2019t be denied that visuals are vital for the travel and tourism industry.\nThis is because they paint the picture of the destination.\n\nPhotography community 500px created a travel agency to test what imagery works\nwith which travel destinations. For the tests, they built landing pages for\neach, accompanied by imagery, content, and a button reading, \u201cTake me there\nnow.\u201d\n\n **Key findings**\n\n  * People in images can increase conversion, depending on where they are. For Havana, pictures with people had twice the conversions. But, for images of nature \u2014 waterfalls, mountains, and beaches \u2014 photos with people performed flat or worse.\n  * Nature landscapes without (young) people are 22% more engaging for viewers 35 years or older.\n  * With high-quality photos, the conversion rates of other destinations like Austria and Slovenia got close to top destinations.\n\nResearch from Tripadvisor says that photos have the greatest impact, driving\nengagement from travelers researching on hotel and B&B pages on their site\neven more than reviews. (While reviews are still as important).  \nWith imagery being so important, you will want your ESP to allow you to\ninclude dynamic content and edit those images easily, but also easily include\nGIFs, videos, etc. Or to be able to insert the images dynamically from your\nsite.\n\n **Email template and workflow functionality**  \nAs newsletters are sent out often, you want to save time creating emails. An\nESP that offers reusable email templates and even creating and saving content\nblocks will make your life much easier.\n\n **Collaborating** on a single email is based on the email production\nworkflow. Different teams and departments must work together for the email to\nresonate fully with your brand. First, goals need to be brainstormed and set,\nthen the content has to be created, and the email has to be designed. Before\nbeing sent, the email will have to be approved.  \nIf there is a lot of back and forth in creating your email campaigns, you will\nwant your ESP to offer changes approval, even dynamic features such as live\ncollaboration within their email builder.\n\nRemember that **personalization** can have a big impact on the attention\nsubscribers pay to your message. For example, you can creatively include the\ncustomer\u2019s name in your images. It is a great way of making your customer feel\nvalued and giving the impression that content is specifically created and\ntailored for them.\n\n## Flash Sales and timed offers\n\nLimited offers are extremely popular in the tourism industry. Brands like\nSecret Escapes, Voyage Priv\u00e9, and Groupon have turned the flash sales model\ninto the core of their business.\n\nAlthough travelers are getting savvier and exploring multiple possibilities\nbefore booking their trips, many decisions are still based on price, deals,\nand discounts.\n\n **Tip: Match your offers with your branding**  \nEverybody loves a good deal, but continuous offers might not be the right\napproach for every hospitality offering. A hotel that only ever communicates\nto its guest list that they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d for them, starts to look like\na hotel on a fire sale all year round. How will a full-rate customer that\nstayed at their property feel if they get emailed each month with 15 to 50%\ndiscounts?\n\n\u201cDiscounts and Specials\u201d can\u2019t be the only reason you send an email to your\nhotel database. It has to fit with your branding. But even if you are not\nplanning to do flash sales regularly, offering tickets or upgrades at\ndiscounted rates can help boost sales during quieter periods.\n\nTo send this offer email, you want your ESP to do advanced segmentation and\nautomated A/B testing.\n\n  *  **Segmenting** a contact list lets you pick the right groups to include in your specific flash sales and travel offers. Think about the customer profile. What are their preferred destinations and typical travel time of year? As well as considering purchasing behavior, you want to exclude people who already booked.\n  * With A/B testing, you can try different email versions to see what works best. For instance, the subject line and copy will inspire the most engagement. For 100% conversion-driven mail like this, you want to optimize and grab each conversion.\n\nA flash sale is over\u2026 in a flash, so there is little time for split testing.\nIt is great if your test winner can be automatically sent to the rest of your\nemail list.\n\nDisplaying an animated countdown in flash sale emails can increase the\nreader\u2019s urgency.\n\n## Seasonal Event Emails\n\nSeasonal events, such as public holidays and vacations, can be your peak\nbooking periods, but they are also a great excuse to promote some of your\nexclusive deals.\n\nThink about it\u2026 By communicating with the proper timing, you can influence\nyour subscribers and give them a little nudge into going on a trip during the\nEaster break or a Bank Holiday weekend. Never underestimate how valuable\nseasonal promotions are for the travel industry.\n\nWe can take it a step further and go into specific events during the year,\nmaking destinations even more attractive.\n\nSome examples of special seasonal events you can promote:  \nChristmas markets;  \nStreet or music festivals, like Carnival in Brazil or Oktoberfest in Germany;  \nCultural events such as art exhibitions of literary festivals;  \nSports events, such as the Tour de France or Wimbledon;  \nSpecial interest events, such as Fashion week.\n\nInforming about special events may convince people to finally go for that trip\nthey\u2019ve been thinking about for a while. Designing creative campaigns around\ncertain marketing moments provides variation and can have a positive impact on\nyour conversion.\n\n **Email targeting on previous purchases and behavior**  \nFor seasonal emails, you want your email software to be able to target\nsubscribers who looked for specific event travel topics on your website. This\nway, you can target people who have already shown an interest to convince them\nto finalize their booking.\n\nYou may also want to target people who have previously booked a specific\nseasonal trip, as they may want to repeat the experience. For all this,\nadvanced email segmentation based on behavior and purchases is the feature you\nare looking for.\n\n## 4\\. Email Automation For The Travel And Tourism Industry:\n\nEmail marketing for travel companies is certainly not only about mass emails.\nIf email blasts are the only way you currently excite prospective travelers,\nyou are missing out on the power of email automation.\n\nTravel is extremely personal, and so is the way people organize and time their\nvacations. Email automation allows you to customize your emails to be both\npersonal and timely.\n\nHere are some key scenarios companies in the travel and tourism industry\nshould consider when planning their email marketing strategy and choosing\ntheir ESP.  \n\n## Welcome Programs\n\nWelcome series allows you to greet your customers when they join your\ncommunity and to offer them valuable information to make the most of your\nservices.\n\nLet them know what type of communication they can expect from you, allow them\nto pick their preferences, and enrich their profile. This will allow you to\nsend more targeted emails later on that are more likely to interest them.\n\nIf they subscribed during a purchase, a welcome series can contain useful\ninformation for their upcoming trip, like a tutorial to make the most of your\nservice or platform. You can also consider promoting referral codes and\ndiscounts to share with friends and family.\n\nWelcome emails can also be a great way to give new customers a brief\nintroduction to your brand and to present yourself. Voyage Prive does this\nvery well by making all customers feel welcomed and valued regardless of their\nholiday preferences.\n\nThe brand also uses the opportunity to highlight a \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the offers\nthat are on at the moment. The Call to Action is repeated at the bottom of the\ncampaign, almost like a PS, that stands out thanks to the use of the bold\nfont.\n\nTo keep track of the success of the email campaigns you send out, ensure your\nESP provides detailed statistics and reports of how your automated emails\nperform in different scenarios.\n\nUnderstandable stats for automated emails is not as standard as you might\nexpect. The statistics for these valuable emails help you understand where and\nhow you should improve your emails.  \n\n## Feedback Emails\n\nBusinesses in the travel and tourism industry rely heavily on users\u2019 reviews\nand ratings of their offers. This is never-ending, as more recent and \u201cfresh\u201d\nreviews are trusted most. However, people won\u2019t remember to go back and share\ntheir feedback or leave a review by themselves (unless they\u2019ve had a terrible\nexperience). So, it is your role to remind them to do so.\n\nConsider combining a Thank You email with a CTA that drives users to a review\nsite. If you want to make sure they don\u2019t miss your feedback request, send\nthem a dedicated email with a quick survey so that they can rate their\nexperience in just a few clicks.\n\nAlways make sure that you let customers know how valuable their feedback is to\nyou, as there is always room for improvement, and you want to know how to\nprovide the best user experience.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s feedback email is a good example. They explain that getting\ncustomers\u2019 feedback will help them provide a better service, but they also let\nthe reader know that they value their time, so the survey will only take a few\nminutes.\n\nPeople tend to be put off by a long series of questions (who has the time for\nthat?!), so letting them know that it will only be quick will increase the\nchances of getting feedback from them.\n\nYou will want your ESP to offer a platform that allows you to build responsive\nemails for feedback emails. This way, customers will be able to display your\nemails on their phones easily and to take the survey on the go as they receive\nit on their phones.\n\nA survey builder could be another feature, depending on where you plan to host\nand store these.\n\n## VIP/Loyalty Programs\n\nIt is not uncommon in the travel and tourism industry for businesses to have\nloyalty or frequent flyer programs to engage customers to return to them.\n\nEmailing members to let them know about their points, offering them promotions\nto increase their balance, or rewarding them for reaching a certain milestone\nis a way to keep them engaged and ensure they remember your brand.\n\nAlternatively, you can have different tiers for returning customers that\nalways book their holidays through you, providing them with special discounts\nas they reach their fifth, tenth, and fifteenth booking.\n\nExamples of loyalty programs that tend to be successful are exclusive rewards\nand loyalty clubs, frequent flyer programs, etc.\n\nReward programs are a means to engage customers with your brand and reward\ntheir loyalty. Like Virgin Atlantic, send out to your customers\u2019 emails with\nspecial offers tailored to their tastes, or you can also, conversely, offer\nthem something they may not have thought about.\n\nIn its email, Virgin Atlantic offers customers an overview of a wide range of\nholidays they offer to stimulate their urgency to book something and have\nsomething to look forward to. Offering your customers a personalized\nexperience will strengthen the relationship and build brand loyalty.\n\nOne of the features that you want your ESP to have to ensure that loyal\ncustomers don\u2019t miss out on these emails is a dedicated deliverability team.\nYou want your ESP not only to take email deliverability very seriously but\nalso to offer you expert assistance so that, even when things go wrong, they\ncan help you get on the right track.\n\n## Email marketing strategy for Travel and tourism\n\nWhile competition in the travel and hospitality industry is fierce, email\nmarketing is one of those rare channels that can help you nail it and attract\nand retain customers.\n\nNewsletters, deals and inspirational emails, loyalty, and all types of life-\ncycle automation can give you a competitive edge to keep travelers returning\nfor more.\n\nFinding the right email marketing strategy and the right email software\npartner for your company will take time, but a thorough job will be rewarded.\n\n#### About Jordie van Rijn\n\n  \n\nJordie van Rijn is an independent email marketing consultant and analyst.
