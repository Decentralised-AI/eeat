Next, we will dig into the Search Term Report data.\n\n# What is Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics provides brands with insights into how customers\nperceive their brand. This includes understanding the impact of Amazon\nreviews, products, price changes, and promotions. Brands can use this\ninformation to improve their overall consumer experience.\n\nBrands can see where their customers spend most of their time online,\nincluding browsing, searching, buying, watching videos, reading reviews, and\nsharing. They can also track whether people shop during prime times, holidays,\nweekends, or weekdays. These insights help brands understand how people\ninteract with their brands across different channels.\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics helps businesses make better decisions based on data\nrather than gut instinct. For example, it allows companies to identify\nseasonal fluctuations, how much money people spent per purchase, and how many\npurchases occurred on mobile devices versus desktop computers.\n\nThe search data report will help brands understand how people use Amazon to\ndiscover products. It includes keyword data from searches conducted on Amazon.\nIt provides insight into the queries that lead people to specific product\ncategories and subcategories.\n\nThe report includes information about the following areas:\n\n  * Keywords used to find products\n  * Product category and subcategory terms\n  * Number of times each term was searched\n  * Average position of each term within the search results\n  * Percentage of total searches performed on Amazon.com\n\n# Amazon Search Terms Report\n\nDirect Amazon supplied search data reflects real customer shopping behavior.\nAccess to customer behavior via the Amazon Brand Analytics Search Terms report\noffers critical shopper Insights.\n\n## What is the Amazon Brand Analytics Search Terms report?\n\nUnder your Amazon Brand Analytics Reports is a treasure trove report called\nthe Amazon Search Terms report. This report provides insight into search-\nrelated customer behavior on Amazon. This tool lets you see how often\nparticular keywords are searched for within Amazon. You can view the data for\nspecific terms, categories, or regions. For example, you could look up how\noften \u201ciPhone XR\u201d was searched for in the United States. Or you could check\nout how frequently \u201cAmazon Alexa\u201d is used in Canada.\n\nYou can filter the data based on date range, location, product type, and\ndevice type. When viewing the data for a particular term, you\u2019ll notice that\nthere are three columns:\n\n\u2022 Total searches \u2014 How many total searches were performed for the given\nkeyword.\n\n\u2022 Average position \u2014 The average position for each item that had a match for\nthe given keyword. If multiple items were matched, the average position is\ncalculated across all those items.\n\n\u2022 Items clicked \u2014 How many items had a match for the keyword.\n\nIf you want to know how often a keyword is searched for, it makes sense to\nfocus on the number of total searches. However, if you\u2019re interested in\nlearning whether a keyword is being searched for more now than in the past,\nyou might want to pay attention to the average position. And if you\u2019re curious\nabout how much traffic a keyword generates, you\u2019d probably like to keep tabs\non the number of clicked items. This is critical data for a robust competitive\nkeywords strategy.\n\nIn addition to providing insights into how people interact with Amazon.com,\nthe Search Terms report gives you access to historical data.\n\nSo, if you want to find out how often a keyword was searched for in the past,\nyou can select a date range and start searching.\n\n# Amazon Search Term Report Metrics and Dimensions\n\nThe report will contain performance metrics for individual search terms that\nreflect the actual buying behavior of Amazon customers resulting from billions\nof searches. The metrics and dimensions in the report provide performance\nmetrics that fuel invaluable insights for more intelligent business decisions.\n\nBelow are the essential metrics and dimensions in the data:\n\n  * The numeric rank of the search\n  * The popular search terms by category (department)\n  * The sales volume of products\n  * The current market share of a product and category\n  * The conversion rate for the product and keyword\n  * The percentage of conversions\n  * The percentage of sales\n  * The product title is associated with a keyword\n\nData is broken down into four date dimensions: DAY, WEEK, MONTH, and QUARTER,\nallowing for trending exact search volume over a more extended period of time.\n\n## What is search frequency rank?\n\nSearch frequency ranks are an essential indication for sellers looking into\nkeyword data. They provide insight into how much traffic you can expect to\nreceive for each keyword over time.\n\nHundreds of thousands of keywords are available in the weekly search frequency\nreport. This includes both broad match and exact match searches. You can see\nhow often people searched for a specific phrase and what percentage of those\nsearches came up during the previous week.\n\nThe search frequency rank is based on the average search volume per day. The\nlower the number, the less likely someone is to search for that term.\n\n## What are click share and conversion share?\n\nClick share gives you an idea of how often a visitor clicks on one of the\nlistings. Conversion share tells you how many visitors converted into sales.\nThis information helps you understand what percentage of people who see your\nlisting buy it. These are essential cues to how a specific competitor\u2019s\nproduct may perform.\n\n# What is an Amazon search analytics dashboard?\n\nAn Amazon Search Analytics dashboard is a visual interface that allows sellers\nto view and analyze data about the performance of their products in search\nresults on the Amazon website. The dashboard typically includes a variety of\ngraphs, charts, and other visual elements that allow sellers to see how their\nproducts are performing in terms of key metrics such as the number of times\nthey appear in search results, the number of clicks they receive, and the\nconversion rate of those clicks into sales.\n\nYou can also automate search data via code-free pipelines.
