Select a date or time range from the report dropdown list.\n  2. Use related search terms, keywords, product titles, or ASINs to pull up your needed data.\n  3. Or define your search by going through the product categories.\n\n## How Do I Access Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is open to all third-party sellers who are part of the\nAmazon Brand Registry program. The following are the criteria for joining the\nBrand Registry Program:\n\n  * You must own the brand\n  * You must be officially associated with the brand\n  * You must sell the brand on the Amazon store.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to Amazon Brand Analytics, it simply means that you\nhave not met the criteria stipulated by the Amazon Brand Registry. However,\nyou can contact the Amazon Seller Support Team for assistance.\n\n## What Reports Does the Amazon Brand Analytics Offer?\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is a collection of metrics and reports, and the\nfollowing are the types of data you can collect with it.\n\n### Amazon Search Terms\n\nThe Amazon Search Terms report provides data on what buyers type in Amazon\u2019s\nsearch bar when looking for your products or competitors. Rather than leaving\nthis information to your imagination, this feature includes the following in\nthe Seller Central Search Terms Report:\n\n  * Most popular search terms or keywords on Amazon within a specific period\n  * The search frequency rank of each search term\n  * Products with the highest conversion rates and click-share\n  * Products with the highest buyer click after using a particular search term\n\nThe Amazon Search Terms report lets you know what terms and keywords to use in\nyour product titles and descriptions. This can assist you in getting your\nproducts in front of potential customers more efficiently and faster.\n\nYou can access this data as follows:\n\n  1. Go to the Brand Analytics Dashboard\n  2. Click on \u201cConsumer Behavior Dashboards\u201d\n  3. Select \u201cAmazon Search Terms\u201d\n\nBelow are the six key points covered in the Amazon Search Terms report:\n\n#### Product Title\n\nThe title of a product is defined by the product\u2019s Amazon Standard\nIdentification Number (ASIN), a unique ID consisting of numbers and letters.\nEvery product on the Amazon store has its ASIN.\n\n#### Search Term\n\nA search term, also known as a keyword, is a combination of words or phrases\nthat customers use when searching for products on the Amazon store. Examples\nare \u201cmen\u2019s vests\u201d, \u201chair growth products for women,\u201d or \u201caftershave for men.\u201d\n\n#### Search Frequency Rank (SFR)\n\nAn SFR is a numerical rank of a specific search term. It shows how popular a\nsearch term is compared with others within a specific period.\n\n#### Click Share\n\nA click share is the number of times a buyer clicked on a particular product\nfor a search term divided by the number of times a buyer clicked on a similar\nproduct for that search term. It is always calculated in percentage.\n\n#### Conversion Share\n\nJust like click share, a conversion share is also calculated in percentage. It\nis the number of times a buyer bought a particular product for a search term\ndivided by the number of times a buyer bought any other product for that\nsearch term.\n\n#### Clicked ASIN\n\nClicked ASIN refers to the products that received the highest number of clicks\nfrom buyers for a particular search term, whether organically in the Amazon\nSERPs or through paid advertisements.\n\n### Market Basket Analysis\n\nThe market basket analysis is one of the most significant analytics metrics\nyou\u2019ll need for your Amazon store. It gives you a chance to increase your\nbasket order value per checkout.\n\nIf you sell electronic gadgets, for example, but don\u2019t sell accessories to go\nwith them, your customers will have no choice but to get them elsewhere. The\nmarket basket analysis shows your three most purchased products during the\nsame period. With this information, you can add the best-selling accessories\nto your portfolio.\n\nProducts purchased in a proportional amount to yours could be complementary\nproducts. You can cross-sell these items or bundle them together with your\nproducts, increasing your order value. Here are the key metrics with which you\ncan sort your market basket report data:\n\n  * Purchase combinations\n  * Most purchased ASIN\n  * Most purchased product titles\n\n### Item Comparison\n\nThere is always a huge difference between the number of people clicking on\nproducts and those making the purchases. You can get insights into the\nshopping patterns of your customers with the Seller Central Item Comparison\nReport.\n\nThis report shows customers the top five products that they have clicked on\nwithin 24 hours of viewing them. It also shows the percentage of customers\nthat viewed each product. Here are the metrics used in the Item Comparison\nReport:\n\n#### Compared ASIN\n\nCompared ASIN includes the ASIN numbers of the products that shoppers compared\nwith your products.\n\n#### Compared Percentage\n\nThe compared percentage is the number of times another product has been viewed\nwithin 24 hours of viewing yours.\n\n#### Alternative Purchase Behavior\n\nWith the alternative purchase behavior, you get to know what competitors\u2019\nproducts shoppers view after yours.\n\n#### Purchased Percentage\n\nThis is the percentage of orders with the compared ASIN to the total number of\nalternative product orders.\n\n### Alternate Purchase Behavior\n\nSimilar to the Item Comparison Report, the Alternate Purchase Report shows you\nyour product's five most purchased alternatives. This report also shows the\ndistribution of time in which each of your products was used as an\nalternative.\n\nWith this report, you can create catalogs depending on what buyers purchase,\nand make decisions on what products you should add to your portfolio and how\nto market them. The alternate purchase behavior analysis makes use of the same\nmetrics as the item comparison while allowing you to sort the data by:\n\n  * Search terms or keywords\n  * Brand\n  * ASIN\n  * Category and subcategories\n\n### Demographics\n\nAs a seller, you must know who your customers are. This will guide you in\ncreating effective marketing strategies for your audience. For example, a\ncollege student\u2019s buying habits will differ from a company CEO\u2019s. With this\ninformation, you can easily tailor your business strategies to help connect\nwith your ideal customers.\n\nThe Amazon demographics report includes charts that show the following:\n\n  * A demographic indicator\n  * The total number of customers who purchased your products\n  * Customers belonging to each demographic as a percentage of all customers\n  * The total number of products ordered\n  * The total number of units ordered for each product\n  * Number of units ordered by each demographic as a percentage of the total number of units ordered\n\nIn this report, you can also get insightful data about your customers based on\nthe following factors:\n\n  * Sales by age\n  * Sales by gender\n  * Sales by the level of education\n  * Sales by household income\n  * Sales by marital status\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Using Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nThe Amazon Brand Analytics tool comes with several benefits that can help you\nachieve your business goals in a more predictable and data-driven way.

With this knowledge, you can make intelligent business\ndecisions. For example, you can see which keywords competitors are ranking for\nand incorporate them in your product title and descriptions.\n\nYou can also get insights on best-selling products and add them to your\nportfolio of products.
