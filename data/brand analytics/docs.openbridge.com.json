As a result, these report is only available to sellers or\nvendors who own a brand (see Amazon Brand Registry). Per Amazon, an\n**_authorizing Seller Central or Vendor Central account must be internal to\nthe brand and responsible for selling the brand in the Amazon store._**\n\nHere is an example of a permission error you may see if you are access\nrestricted:\n\n##  **Checking Your Permissions**\n\n  *  **Sellers:** If you are not able to access Brand Analytics, go to the Brand Benefit Eligibility page where you can click \u2018 **Review my eligibility** \u2019 to correct your status and gain access to Brand Analytics reports.\n\n  *  **Vendors: Confirm your brand is registered in** Amazon Brand Registry. Also, make sure the authorizing user account has all reporting access types (Operations, Finance, Digital, etc.) enabled.\n\n## **Fixing Permissions Issues**\n\n **Sellers**\n\nIf you see an error message stating \u201cYou do not have permission to access this\npage,\u201d request the Primary Account Administrator grant you permission to\n\u201cAmazon Brand Analytics\u201d on the Global User Permissions page.\n\nYou may also see the following notice on the Brand Benefit Eligibility page:\n\n  *  _You are designated as a secondary user and do not have permission to view this page._\n\nTo resolve this, you must contact the Primary Account Administrator to grant\n\"View\" permissions under - _Settings - > User Permissions -> Manage Global\nPermissions -> Select user_ and set the status to \u201cView\u201d for \u201cBrand Benefit\nEligibility\u201d under the \u201cPerformance\u201d category.\n\n**Vendors**\n\nTo validate permissions in your vendor account, please check your permissions\nas shown below. Unlike Sellers, there is no Brand Benefits page in Vendor\nCentral. As a result, you need to assess the permissions granted to your\nVendor Central user account.\n\nFor additional permissions information, see How To Configure Amazon Selling\nPartner Permissions or Troubleshooting SP-API User Permissions.\n\nDid this answer your question?\n\n\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude03\n\n  * blog.openbridge.com\n  * www.openbridge.com\n\n  *   * \n\nIntercomWe run on Intercom\n\n",
