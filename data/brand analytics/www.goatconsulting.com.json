Amazon provides a range of reports that help\nsellers with inventory management, sales, advertising optimizations, and more.\nOne unique tool offered to Amazon sellers is the Demographics report, located\nin the Brand Analytics dashboard.  This report summarizes demographic\ninformation about a seller\u2019s customer base, including age, gender, income, and\nmore. The dashboard further breaks down the reporting range, allowing you to\nfilter by date. With so much data, it can be difficult to interpret and\neffectively utilize this information. By breaking down the information and\nanalyzing the key metrics, sellers can identify opportunities to customize\ntheir product offerings and connect with shoppers. This article will walk\nthrough the basics of the Seller Central Demographics report, including an\noverview of what the Brand Analytics Demographics report is and who can use\nit, how to pull a demographic report on Seller Central , and analyzing the\ndemographic information to derive key insights about your customers.\n\n## Brand Analytics Demographics Report Overview\n\nThe demographics report on seller central is an analytical tool that helps\nsellers learn more about their customers.  The tool provides information about\nthe customers, including their age, income, education, gender, and marital\nstatus.  This data can be used to connect sellers to their customer base and\nbetter tailor to their needs.  Each demographic metric contains valuable\ninformation that can tell a story and illustrate more about the customer.\nWhen combined with other Brand Analytics reports, like Repeat Purchase\nBehavior and Market Basket Analysis, this report can help sellers and\nmarketers create a clear picture of who their customers are and what they are\nlooking for from the brand.\n\nThe Amazon demographics report allows the seller to view weekly, monthly or\nquarterly data.  Sellers that have multiple registered brands or who sell a\nvariety of products can also filter this data by the brand name or product\ncategory.  Once a category, brand, and reporting period have been selected,\nthe report summarizes data for the Unique Customers and the Unique Orders.\nThe report shows a total count of unique orders and unique customers for each\ndemographic cohort.  It also provides the percentage of the total and the\nchange in percentage compared to the last reporting period.  The report also\nconveniently breaks each demographic down into groupings, making it easier to\ninterpret the data.  For example, the age is split into 6 groupings, making\nthe information much easier to comprehend.\n\n## How to Pull a Demographic Report on Seller Central and Organize the Data?\n\nThe demographics report on seller central is located under Brand Analytics.\nBrand registered sellers can find this report by navigating to the \u201cBrands\u201d\ntab of seller central, clicking \u201cBrand Analytics\u201d, and then selecting\n\u201cDemographics\u201d at the top of the page.  At this point, filter the report by\nthe reporting period, brand, and category. Sellers can then view the report at\na glance or can download the data and identify further insights by using a\npivot table and other excel functions.\n\nWhen analyzing the report using excel, organize the data so that it is easier\nto read and understand.  If pulling data from multiple reporting periods, make\nsure that the data is separated to avoid later confusion.  To gain further\ninsight, create a pivot table from the data. Pivot tables can help you\nidentify patterns and trends in the data along with making comparisons between\ndifferent groups.  \n\n## Analyze the Demographic Information and Derive Key Insights About your\nCustomers\n\nOverall, the demographics report contains a lot of valuable information.  So\nwhat can an Amazon seller do with all of this data?  Marketers and Advertisers\nplace a lot of emphasis on demographic reporting because it can help brands\nconnect with their audiences and identify ways to improve communication with\ntheir customers.  For this reason, it\u2019s important to understand how each\nmetric can be used.\n\n### Age and Gender Demographics\n\nAge and gender are often a major focus since these details can predict a\ncustomer\u2019s interests and lifestyle. People that fall into the same age group\nand gender often have similar interests and shopping habits.\n\n### Income Demographics\n\nIncome is another important factor since it indicates the level of\ndiscretionary spending that the customer has.  This data is useful for showing\nthe products that are considered essential, in which every income grouping\npurchases them at the same level, vs products that are more luxury, in which\nthe product is purchased more often by customers with higher incomes.\n\n### Education Level and Marital Status\n\nEducation level and marital status are great for predicting lifestyle\nbehaviors and customer priorities.  Married people often spend differently\nthan single people because their expenses are shared and they are more likely\nto be shopping for a family.\n\n### Education Demographics\n\nEducation level can indicate customer priorities and may correlate strongly\nwith brand values and ethics.\n\nOnce you better understand these details about your customers, you can begin\nbuilding out demographic cohorts.  Cohorts are a group of people with shared\ncharacteristics.  With this data, a brand may realize that the majority of\ntheir customers are married women with an income level over $100,000.  The\nbrand can then use this information to communicate their products\u2019 attributes\nand overall value to fit what the customer cares about most.  In this case,\nthe brand may communicate that their products are great for busy parents or\nkid-friendly.  The brand can also utilize this information when advertising,\nby picking more relevant audiences and aligning their offerings with similar\nbrands.  There are many opportunities for growth for brands that utilize the\nBrand Analytics demographics report.  The key to successfully using this\ninformation is identifying what the customers have in common and how this\ntranslates to their shopping behaviors.\n\n  \n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on the Brand Analytics Amazon Demographics\nReport\n\n### How many orders are needed for a seller to have access to a demographic\nreport?\n\nAt least 100 unique customers are needed to access a demographic report.  If\nyou don\u2019t have that many customers, try increasing the reporting range to\nmonthly or quarterly.\n\n### What metrics are included in the Seller Central Demographics report?\n\nAge, income, education level, gender, and marital status are included in the\nSeller Central demographics report.\n\n### Can I search for a specific ASIN in the demographics dashboard?\n\nYes, sellers can search for a specific product by using the ASIN search box at\nthe top of the report dashboard.  Note that this feature is currently only\nincluded in the old version of the dashboard.  It may be available on the new\nversion of the analytics dashboard at a later date but currently is not.\n\n### Do I need to be brand registered to access the demographics report?\n\nYes, sellers need to have a registered brand on seller central in order to\naccess Brand Analytics and its reports.
