Rosie is\nstruggling to understand her customers on a deeper level and take her sales to\nthe next level. She wants to optimize her product listings and marketing\nstrategies but feels a bit constrained despite having access to multiple\nthird-party seller tools and mastermind group subscriptions\u2014things that have\nhelped her tremendously in her Amazon journey so far.\n\nRosie has done good. She now wants to do great!\n\nEnter Amazon Brand Analytics.\n\nIn this guide, we'll show you how Amazon Brand Analytics can help you (and\nRosie) identify customer pain points, motivations, and desires to connect with\nyour audience more effectively and drive higher conversions. We'll take a\ncloser look at the benefits of using the ABA tool, so you can optimize your\nproduct detail pages and ad campaigns better than ever and increase your\nsales, while standing out from the competition.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics.\n\n## What is Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\n **Amazon Brand Analytics is a powerful tool for Amazon sellers. It provides\nvaluable brand insights by analyzing customer search and purchase behavior, as\nwell as frequently bought together ASINs. With this data, sellers can optimize\nproduct listings and marketing strategies and increase sales and brand\nvisibility**.\n\n _Did you know:_ There are over 6 million third-party sellers on Amazon\nworldwide and more than 2000 new sellers join the marketplace daily? By\nleveraging Amazon seller Brand Analytics, you can gain a competitive edge and\nboost your overall performance in your niche.\n\nThe Amazon Brand Analytics tool was officially released in early 2019. It was\ninitially launched as a beta program, available only to a select group of\nAmazon sellers. However, Amazon gradually expanded access to the tool, making\nit available to more sellers over time. Today, Amazon Brand Analytics supports\nall major Amazon marketplaces, including Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.ca,\nAmazon.de, Amazon.au, Amazon.co.jp, Amazon.in, and Amazon.fr among others.\n\n### Difference Between Amazon Brand Store Insights and Amazon Brand Analytics\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics shouldn\u2019t be confused with Amazon Brand Store Insights.\nThey are two completely different tool sets available inside Seller Central.\n\nAmazon Brand Store Insights provides brands with valuable analytics and\ninsights on their Amazon brand store performance, such as page views, unique\nvisitors, sales, and conversion rates. It helps brands optimize their store's\nlayout, product offerings, and marketing strategies to improve their overall\nperformance on Amazon. You need a dedicated brand store on Amazon to access\nthe tool.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon Brand Analytics provides Amazon sellers with\ninsights into customer search behavior, purchase behavior, and frequently\nviewed ASINs. It has nothing to do with your store\u2019s performance. In fact, you\ndon\u2019t even need a brand store on Amazon to use the ABA tool.\n\nThis begs an important question:\n\n## Who Can Use Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\n **Any third-party private label seller enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry\nprogram can use Amazon Brand Analytics.** Unfortunately, wholesalers, online\narbitrage sellers, and dropshippers don\u2019t have permission to access the tool.\nEven Kindle authors can\u2019t use it.\n\nHere is a detailed Amazon Brand Analytics eligibility criteria:\n\n  * You must be a seller on Amazon\n  * You must own a brand\n  * You must not be a reseller of the product you\u2019re selling\n  * You must be enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry program\n\nWhat if you don\u2019t have an active registered trademark for the brand you own?\n\nSellers without a trademark (or pending trademark applications) can also use\nAmazon Brand Analytics. As long as you are enrolled in the Amazon Brand\nRegistry program, you are good to go.\n\nWhat about Amazon vendors, though?\n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics Seller Central vs Vendor Central\n\n **Amazon vendors have access to a different version of the brand analytics\ntool inside Vendor Central, called Amazon Retail Analytics or ARA**. The main\ndifference between Amazon Retail Analytics (ARA) and Amazon Seller Central\nBrand Analytics is the audience they serve. ARA is designed for vendors who\nsell their products directly to Amazon, while ABA is designed for sellers who\nhave enrolled in Amazon's Brand Registry program and sell independently.\n\nIn terms of reports and insights, ARA provides vendors with a wider range of\ndata and analytics compared to ABA to help them optimize their performance on\nAmazon's marketplace. It also contains additional reports, such as the\nMarketing Dashboard, which shows vendors how their advertising campaigns are\nperforming.\n\nSome of the reports that are available through Amazon Retail Analytics (ARA)\nbut not via Amazon Brand Analytics (ABA) include:\n\n  1. Detail Page Sales and Traffic (DPST) Report: This report provides data on a vendor's sales and traffic metrics broken down by ASIN, allowing vendors to identify which products are driving the most traffic and sales.\n  2. Product and Customer Metrics (PCM) Report: This report provides detailed data on a vendor's sales and traffic by customer demographics, such as age, gender, and location.\n  3. Operational Efficiency Reports: These reports provide vendors with data on their operational performance, including metrics related to order fulfillment, shipping, and returns.\n  4. Financial Reports: ARA provides vendors with access to a range of financial reports, including invoicing and payment reports, which are not available via ABA.\n\nOverall, both ARA and ABA provide valuable data and insights to their\nrespective audiences, and the types of data and reports they offer differ\nbased on their intended use case.\n\n## Is Amazon Brand Analytics Free?\n\n **Yes, Amazon Brand Analytics is absolutely free to use**. There is no signup\nor monthly maintenance fee, and sellers can access the tool as long as their\naccount and Amazon Brand Registry remain active.\n\nYou might wonder why Amazon keeps ABA free to use when it can charge sellers\nfor the data and insights. After all, most third-party seller tools charge\ntheir customers for such services and tools and sellers happily for them\n(too). It doesn\u2019t make business sense for Amazon to do that, right?\n\nWell, there is more to it than meets the eye!\n\nOne incentive for Amazon to offer the Brand Analytics tool for free to sellers\nis to encourage more brands to enroll in Amazon's Brand Registry program. That\nway, it can attract more brands to its marketplace and continue to dominate\nthe ecommerce landscape as a market leader.\n\nFurthermore, by providing sellers with data on customer behavior and search\ntrends, Amazon helps sellers improve their listings, which leads to higher-\nquality product pages and a better customer experience overall. This\nultimately benefits Amazon's reputation and bottom line.\n\nFinally, the Amazon Brand Analytics Terms & Conditions give rights to the\ne-com giant to use the data to improve its own marketplace and services and\nprovide targeted advertising to customers. This, again, helps Amazon to\nimprove its business offerings and accrue more in overall revenue.\n\nThat\u2019s very smart, Houston. Very smart indeed!\n\n## How to Access Amazon Brand Analytics from Your Seller Account\n\nSo how do you even access Amazon Brand Analytics? Simple, just follow these 4\nquick steps to get started:\n\n  1. Step #1: Get brand registered on Amazon. Check out our in-depth Amazon Brand Registry guide for more details. Make sure you, at least, have a pending trademark registration before you apply for Amazon Brand Registry. All US sellers must submit their trademark applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  \n\n  2. Step #2: Log in to Seller Central\n\n  3. Step #3: Navigate to the main menu from the Seller Central home screen\n\n  4. Step #4: Select Brands > Brand Analytics from the main menu to launch the ABA tool\n\nIn some cases, the Brand Analytics option is not automatically enabled when\nyou first try to access the tool. This is normal, and you don\u2019t need to panic.\nJust open a case with the Amazon seller support team, and they should get you\nsorted.\n\nSo what are the available reports inside the Amazon Brand Analytics dashboard?\n\n## 6 Types of Amazon Brand Analytics Reports\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics offers six types of analytical reports (or dashboards),\nincluding Search Catalog Performance Report, Search Query Performance Report,\nTop Search Terms Report, Repeat Purchase Behavior Report, Market Basket\nAnalysis Report, and Demographics Report.\n\nThe Search Catalog Performance Report and the Search Query Performance Report\nprimarily serve as search analytics dashboards, allowing you to monitor and\nanalyze the search performance metrics for the various ASINs listed under your\nbrand.\n\nMeanwhile, the other four reports act more as consumer behavior dashboards,\nwhere they give you valuable insights into consumer behavior and market trends\non Amazon. Using these insights, you can make informed decisions about your\nproduct development, marketing, and advertising strategies.  \n\nLet\u2019s look at each of these reports in more detail.\n\n _The Need to Know:_ The older version of the Brand Analytics tool had an\nadditional dashboard called the **Item Comparison and Alternate Purchase\nBehavior Report**. However, Amazon discontinued the report in June 2022, and\nit\u2019s no longer available per the latest update.\n\n  1. Search Catalog Performance Report\n\nThe Search Catalog Performance Report shows you the performance analytics of\nyour products across the search shopping funnel, allowing you to compare them\nto identify the underperforming ASINs that may need a rethink in strategy.\nThis data becomes especially helpful if you sell products in the same niche.\n\nYou can get the Search Catalog Report over multiple reporting ranges,\nincluding weekly, monthly, and quarterly. The product views are limited to\n10,000 ASINs at a time, with the metrics having a 24-hr attribution period.\n\nBelow is a list of the important metrics available inside the Search Catalog\nPerformance dashboard:\n\n  * Impressions\n  * Clicks\n  * Click\n  *   \n\n  *  Rate (CTR)\n  * Cart adds\n  * Purchases\n  * Conversion rate\n\n _The Need to Know:_ The ABA tool and the Brand Analytics reports don\u2019t\naccount for the hits generated through PPC ads displayed as widgets or on\nproduct detail pages. Make sure to keep this in mind when analyzing the\nnumbers to guide your strategy.\n\n  2. Search Query Performance Report\n\nNext, you have the Search Query Performance Report. This report shows you the\ntop 1000 queries that led customers to your brand and allows you to analyze\nthe performance of each of those search queries across the complete shopping\nfunnel.\n\nYou get two views under the Search Query Performance dashboard: i) Brand view,\nand ii) ASIN view. Meanwhile, the reporting range varies from weekly to\nquarterly. The Search Query Performance report is arguably the most important\nreport available inside the Amazon Brand Analytics manager.\n\nBelow are some critical metrics you can find in the report:\n\n  * Total count\n  * Click rate\n  * Brand count\n  * Brand share\n\n _For What It\u2019s Worth:_ Unsure what the different metrics mean for the ABA\nreport you are analyzing? You can always consult the Metric Glossary section\nto view the definitions of the important terms across the different Amazon\nBrand Analytics reports.  ** **\n\n  3. Repeat Purchase Behavior Report\n\nThe Repeat Purchase Behavior Report provides insights into repeat purchase and\ncustomer retention patterns by ASIN or brand. You can get a comprehensive\nbreakdown of your unique and repeat purchases at revenue, order, and customer\nlevels and make data-driven decisions to increase brand loyalty and improve\nyour bottom line.\n\nHere are some important metrics worth tracking when analyzing the Repeat\nPurchase Behavior Report:\n\n  * Sales\n  * Units\n  * Repeat Customers\n  * Change vs. Prior Period\n  * % Share of total sales\n\n  4. Demographics Report\n\nYou also get the Demographics Report inside Amazon Brand Analytics. As the\nname implies, this report shows you the demographic spread of the users who\npurchase from your brand on the Amazon marketplace. You need a minimum of 100\nunique customers in the selected reporting range for the data to become\navailable.\n\nUsing the Demographics Report, sellers can understand their target audience\nbetter and learn more about their age, salary, education, and gender. The\nreport is currently available in the US marketplace only.\n\n  5. Top Search Terms Report\n\nAlso known as the Amazon Search Terms Report, this dashboard provides\nvisibility into the top search terms for the products sold on the Amazon\nmarketplace. The search terms are sorted by the Search Frequency Rank (SFR)\nand can be filtered for relevant departments. Sellers can navigate to the\nsearch terms of their interest and check the top three ASINs that get the most\nclicks and conversions against them.\n\nIt\u2019s quite interesting to see the difference between the Top Search Terms\nReport and the Search Query Performance Report. The latter shows data for the\nsearch terms that are relevant to your brand only, while the Amazon Search\nTerms dashboard gives you a market-level breakdown for all the popular search\nterms on the marketplace. You can get the report for daily, weekly, monthly,\nand quarterly reporting periods.\n\nBelow are some important metrics to track inside the Amazon Search Terms\nReport:\n\n  * Search Frequency Rank\n  * Click Share\n  * Conversion Share\n\n  6. Market Basket Analysis Report\n\nLast but not least, you have the Market Basket Analysis Report. This report\nshows you the top three ASINs frequently bought together with your product,\nuncovering interesting insights about your customers\u2019 shopping behavior.\n\nSellers can select from weekly, monthly, and quarterly reporting periods when\nrequesting the Market Basket Report for their brand.  However, quarterly\nranges are usually preferred for a more holistic analysis.\n\n### Can You Download the Amazon Brand Analytics Sheets for Offline Viewing?\n\nYes, you can download the Amazon Brand Analytics sheets for offline viewing,\nanytime you want. All the downloaded reports and their status can be found\ninside the Download Manager, available at the top of the ABA dashboard.\n\n### Amazon Attribution (Beta) \u2013 An Additional Brand Analytics Feature\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics also allows sellers to measure the impact of their non-\nAmazon online marketing channels on their total Amazon sales through the\nAmazon Attribution tool. You need to register for this tool separately from\ninside Seller Central. Once enabled, you can access it from the Brand\nAnalytics dashboard.\n\nThe tool works by providing unique tracking URLs that sellers can use in their\ndigital advertising campaigns outside of Amazon, such as Facebook or website\ndisplay ads. When a customer clicks on one of these tracking URLs and makes a\npurchase on Amazon, the purchase is attributed back to the corresponding\nadvertising campaign.\n\nAmazon Attribution provides insights into how your non-Amazon digital\nmarketing efforts are driving sales on Amazon, which can help you optimize\nyour advertising campaigns to maximize your return on investment (ROI).\nAdditionally, it allows you to understand your entire customer journey from\ninitial engagement with a non-Amazon ad to the final purchase on Amazon, which\ncan help you better understand your target audience and improve your marketing\nstrategies.\n\n## How to Use Amazon Brand Analytics to Optimize Your Strorefront\n\nFinally, here are some of the use cases of the Amazon Brand Analytics reports:\n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Listing Optimization\n\nYou can use the different reports inside Amazon Brand Analytics to optimize\nyour listing. For example, using the Search Performance Query Report, you can\ndiscover all the different keywords that are bringing traffic to your listing.\nYou can then identify and shortlist the ones that are not already added to\nyour listing and incorporate them to boost your Amazon SEO and organic\nrankings.\n\nLikewise, you can use the Amazon Search Terms Report to find the related\nsearch terms (or popular variants) of your primary keyword and add them to\nyour listing copy to improve product visibility and search performance.  \n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Effective PPC Management\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics can also help you spot issues in your PPC campaigns and\nmanage them more effectively. For example, you can use the Search Performance\nQuery Report data to find cannibalized keywords part of your live ads and drop\nthem to reduce your PPC burn.\n\nWondering how?\n\nSimply, go to the Search Performance Query Report and make a list of all the\nrelated keywords with high impressions. Next, pause the ad campaigns for those\nkeywords and see if there is any significant drop in the engagements. The\nmetrics for the cannibalized set of keywords should remain largely unaffected.  \n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Product Research\n\nRemember the Market Basket Analysis Report and how it shows you frequently\nbought together ASINs alongside your product? Well, you can use those insights\nto find cross-selling and bundling ideas for your product line and expand your\nbusiness further.\n\nIf you want to explore any particular niche, you can use the Top Search Terms\nReport and check the popular search terms to find ideas for your next launch.\nOf course, you must perform other checks to ensure the product is viable.\nAfter all, high demand doesn\u2019t always translate to higher profits. Here is our\nultimate Amazon product research guide to help you get started.\n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Sales Optimization\n\nWith Amazon Brand Analytics, you can even optimize your storefront sales. For\nexample, using the Search Catalog Performance Report, you can analyze and\ncompare different ASINs in your product catalog across their search shopping\nfunnels and identify where they might be lacking. You can then isolate the\nproblem area and narrow down your workings to find an effective solution.  \n\nIf the products are in the same niche, you can even replicate some of the\nstrategies that are working for your other ASINs to fix the broken funnel. Why\nreinvent the wheel, eh?\n\nSimilarly, you can use the findings from the Repeat Purchase Behavior Report\nand identify products that your target audience often likes to purchase from\nyou. These products can have a Subscribe & Save option to boost your repeat\nsales.  \n\n## Amazon Brand Analytics Key Benefits\n\n  *  **Provides first-hand, accurate marketplace data:** Amazon Brand Analytics provides first-hand and accurate marketplace data, sourced directly from Amazon's internal metrics and reporting tools. This data includes information on customer behavior, search patterns, and purchasing habits on the platform. With this data, sellers and brands can gain a better understanding of their customers and the market, allowing them to make informed decisions about their sales and marketing strategies. Accurate and reliable data is crucial for making effective business decisions, and Amazon Brand Analytics provides sellers and brands with a wealth of valuable information.\n  *  **Market-wide reporting, not limited to your ASINs only:** The ABA tool takes analysis to a whole new level by providing market-wide reporting without limiting sellers to data points specific to their brands or brands\u2019 ASINs only. This means that sellers and brands can access insights into the broader market and their competitors, allowing them to identify trends and opportunities for growth. For example, the Amazon Search Terms Report provides insight into the search terms that customers are using to find products on Amazon and breaks down the top 3 clicked ASINs for each. This way, sellers and brands can study the overall market and optimize their product listings for increased visibility and sales. By providing market-wide reporting, Amazon Brand Analytics enables sellers and brands to make data-driven decisions that will benefit their business.\n  *  **Is free to use:** One of the significant benefits of Amazon Brand Analytics is that it is free to use for registered brand owners and professional sellers. This means that even small and medium-sized businesses can access valuable data and insights to optimize their Amazon sales and marketing strategies, without incurring additional costs. Amazon Brand Analytics provides a range of tools and reports that sellers can use to gain a competitive edge and increase sales for no additional investment.\n  *  **Analyze and optimize multiple aspects of your ecommerce business:** Amazon Brand Analytics provides a wide range of tools and reports that allow sellers and brands to analyze and optimize multiple aspects of their ecommerce business. This includes product performance, customer behavior, search patterns, and advertising campaigns. With this data, sellers and brands can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to supercharge their business. For example, the Repeat Purchase Behavior report can provide insights into customer loyalty and retention, allowing sellers and brands to develop targeted marketing strategies to increase repeat purchases and customer lifetime value.\n\n## Other Useful Amazon Brand-Specific Features\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is not the only feature you get when you enroll in the\nAmazon Brand Registry program. Here are some other useful features worth\nexploring:\n\n  * Amazon Transparency\n  * Amazon A+ Content\n  * Virtual Bundles\n\n## Combine Amazon Brand Analytics and ZonGuru to Take Your Business to the\nNext Level!\n\nWhile Amazon Brand Analytics is quite useful for understanding and optimizing\nyour business operations at a deeper level, the fact is it does not provide\nyou with everything you need to make it big on the smiling A. You still need a\nreliable third-party seller tool, like ZonGuru, to get additional insights\ninto areas such as competitor analysis, keyword research, and product pricing.  \n\nBy combining data from both sources, sellers can gain a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of their business and the market, allowing them to make more\ninformed decisions about their sales and marketing strategies.\n\nFor example, ZG\u2019s Keywords on Fire tool helps you uncover keywords your\ncompetitors are targeting in their listings. These keywords are not accessible\nthrough Amazon Brand Analytics. You can only get them through a third-party\nseller tool like ZonGuru.\n\nIn the end, it all boils down to how bullish and willing you are to take your\nAmazon business to the next level. Hundreds and thousands of sellers do well\non the marketplace, but only a few do great.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to give ZonGuru a test run and see what it can do for your\nbusiness, you can sign up for our 7-day free trial.\n\n\u200d\n\n##\n\n##\n\n#####\n\n#####\n\n#####\n\n#####\n\n### Amazon SEO eBook\n\n##### Get to page 1 on Amazon with the Ultimate SEO ebook.\n\n##### Download eBook\n\nNo items found.\n\n#### Share this Article\n\n## Hammad Nafees\n\nAmazon Consultant\n\nHammad is an Amazon aficionado and consultant.
