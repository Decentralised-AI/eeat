Their needs,\ninterests, and purchasing powers \u2013 all of these will help you craft a\npersonalized marketing strategy that speaks directly to your customers and\ngets them to buy your product.\n\nBut you need data for that!\n\nLaunched in 2019, Amazon Brand Analytics gives you access to all the data you\nneed to understand the purchasing behavior of customers.\n\nUsing that, you can effectively craft your marketing strategy and build brand\nawareness and revenue.\n\nLet\u2019s understand in detail what Amazon Brand Analytics does and how it can\nhelp you increase your sales.\n\n **A quick peek into the article:**\n\n  1. What is Amazon Brand Analytics?\n  2. Amazon Brand Analytics Eligibility Requirements\n  3. What Reports Can You Get From Amazon Brand Analytics?\n  4. Benefits of Using Amazon Brand Analytics?\n  5. Final Thoughts\n\n## What is Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nAmazon released Amazon Brand Analytics solutions for registered brand owners\nto help them grow sales and customer loyalty.\n\nThis tool gives you an inside view of:\n\n  * What keywords do shoppers use to find products, \n  * The products customers compare and buy after viewing their offers, \n  * The items customers frequently buy together, \n  * And the products customers buy repeatedly. \n\nBrand Analytics also provides demographic data on customer location, gender,\nage, income, and marital status.\n\nWith this information, you can:\n\n  * Improve product visibility with targeted advertising\n  * Drive more online sales with smart pricing and attractive offers\n  * Understand shopping habits to reach new customers\n  * Offer the right product mix to get ahead of competitors \n\nNot only does Amazon Brand Analytics (ABA) provide these insights, but it also\nmakes them easy to understand and actionable, thanks to its intuitive and\nuser-friendly interface.\n\n## Amazon Brand Analytics Eligibility Requirements\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is available in Seller Central for all Amazon Brand\nregistered sellers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see it in your Seller Central dashboard, you simply don\u2019t meet\nthe criteria to become a brand-registered seller on Amazon.\n\nLearn about how to register your brand on Amazon from this **detailed guide**\n**.  **\n\n### Where Can You Find The Brand Analytics Tool?\n\nNow, if you are brand-registered, simply log into your Seller Central account\nand find \u201cBrand Analytics\u201d under the \u201cBrand\u201d section in the left navigation\npane.\n\n## What Reports Can You Get From Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nIn the Brand Analytics Dashboard, you can see six reports in two segments:\n\n  1. Search Analytics\n  2. Consumer Behavior Analytics\n\nUnder **search analytics** , you get\n\n  * Search Catalog Performance\n  * Search Query Performance\n  * Top Search Terms\n\nUnder **consumer behavior analytics** ,\n\n  * Repeat Purchase Behavior\n  * Demographics\n  * Market basket Analysis\n\nAll these reports help you understand the nitty gritty of the shopping\njourney, and create a data-driven marketing strategy.\n\n### Search Catalog Performance\n\nThis report reveals how customers interact with your brand\u2019s product\nthroughout the shopping journey.\n\nThe Search Catalog Performance Dashboard displays the following metrics for\neach ASIN:\n\n  *  **Search Funnel \u2013 Impressions**\n    * Impressions: Total number of impressions across all search queries during the selected time period\n    * Rating (Median): Median rating of the ASIN while showing on the search result\n\n  *  **Search Funnel \u2013 Clicks**\n    * Clicks: The total number of ASIN clicks or glance views during the selected time period.\n    * Click Rate (CTR): It represents the percentage of clicks to impressions for ASINs originating from the search results page.\n\n  *  **Search Funnel \u2013 Cart Adds**\n    * Cart Adds: The total number of ASINs added to the cart during the selected time period, generated from the search result\n\n  *  **Search Funnel \u2013 Purchases**\n    * Purchases: The total number of ASIN purchases during the selected time period, originating from the search results page.\n    * Search Traffic Sales: The grand total of all sales revenues during the selected time period, originating from the search results page.\n    * Conversion Rate:  It\u2019s the percentage of purchases to clicks for ASINs originating from the search results page.\n\nApart from these, you also get some other metrics for each stage of the\npurchasing funnel:\n\n  *  **Same-Day Shipping Speed:** Indicates the number of times an ASIN, viewed/ clicked/ placed in the cart/ purchased, displayed a message offering same-day delivery on the search results page.\n  *  **1D Shipping Speed:** It records the number of times an \u201cimpressed/ clicked/ cart-added/ purchased\u201d ASIN displays a message for \u201cone-day delivery\u201d on the search results page.\n  *  **2D Shipping Speed:** Tracks the frequency of an ASIN, viewed/ clicked/ placed in the cart/ purchased, displaying a two-day delivery message on the search results page.\n\nThese metrics help you understand how your customers move from one stage to\nanother in their customer journey.\n\nFor example, if you see a high number of impressions but a low CTR, it\nindicates your product listing is not appealing enough, or it may not match\ncustomers\u2019 intent. You need to work on the product image and product title to\nget more clicks.\n\nSimilarly, if the cart adds are high but actual purchases are low, it means\nyou have a high cart abandonment rate. Here, you can reduce the friction in\nthe checkout process or implement a retargeting strategy to get people back to\nyour listing and complete the purchase.\n\nWith the Shipping Speed (Same day, 1D, 2D) metric, you can determine how it\ninfluences the buyer\u2019s decision.\n\n### Search Query Performance\n\nThis dashboard displays top search queries that lead to your brand\u2019s products\nfrom the search. It also shows overall metrics (impressions, clicks, cart\nadds, purchases) for each query and your brand\u2019s share.\n\nBy default, Amazon shows the Brand view to understand your overall brand(s)\nperformance.

You can use\nthis information to optimize your on and off-Amazon marketing messaging to\nmaximize awareness and conversions.\n\n### Market Basket Analysis\n\nYou can see customers are visiting your product and purchasing. But is there\nany way to increase the average order value?\n\nFor example, customers are buying yoga mats. They also tend to purchase\nsweatpants and sports shoes. Since you don\u2019t offer them, customers naturally\nshift towards some other brands.\n\nInstead, if you bundle a yoga mat with sweatpants and shoes, it can increase\nthe average order value.\n\nBut how do you know what products shoppers commonly buy together?\n\n **Market Basket Analysis** provides insights into the products that are\nfrequently purchased together, allowing you to create effective bundling and\ncross-selling opportunities.\n\nThe report gives the following metrics for the top three purchase\ncombinations:\n\n  * Product Title\n  * Product ASIN\n  * Combination %\n\nThe Market Basket Report helps you identify cross-marketing opportunities and\ncreate value-based bundles to increase the average order value.\n\n## Benefits of Amazon Brand Analytics\n\nThe Amazon Brand Analytics tool comes with multiple benefits. Here are some of\nthem:\n\n### Get First-hand Marketplace Data\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics provides accurate market data straight from Amazon\u2019s\nin-house reporting. This includes customer behaviors, search trends, and\nbuying habits on the platform.\n\nYou can use this data to create data-backed marketing strategies.\n\nABA tool also provides market-wide reporting without restricting itself to a\nsingle brand. It gives brands a birds-eye view of the broader market, allowing\nthem to identify trends and opportunities for growth.\n\n### Identify Target Audience\n\nWith the Demographic report, you can tap into your target audience with utmost\naccuracy.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you are selling organic moisturizers. When you went through\nthe Demographic data, you saw that most of your audience who are purchasing\nthe product are between 18 \u2013 24 women, earning $50,000 \u2013 $74,999, and\nunmarried.\n\nWith this information, you can create personalized ad copy directed to your\ntarget audience that generates better results.\n\n### Understand Customer Shopping Behavior\n\nWith the Repeat purchase analysis dashboard, you can understand which ASINs\nand brands get the most repeat purchases. This information helps you optimize\nyour advertising strategy to get more sales for these products.\n\n### Identify High-Performing Keywords\n\nYou can also find search terms that perform well from Amazon Brand Analytics.\n\nFor example, if you see on the Search Query Performance report that some\nkeywords have high search volume and also have significant cart-add and\npurchase count, it means it\u2019s a high-performing search query.\n\nYou can increase your advertising budget for this keyword to increase\nconversion chances.\n\nEven though ABA is a sophisticated tool, it doesn\u2019t give all the information\nabout a search query.\n\nYou should pick search terms with decent search volume and are moderately\ncompetitive, and you want to find better insights into keywords. Here\u2019s what\nyou can do:\n\n  * Step 1: Navigate to SellerApp Keyword Research tool.\n  * Step 2: Type the search term you want to search and analyze.\n\n  * Step 3: Analyze the result based on search volume, relevancy score, estimated orders, and conversion rate to find the most profitable keywords. \n\n#### Final Thoughts\n\nScaling an e-commerce business can be tricky, and Amazon is no exception.\n\nWith the data from Amazon Brand Analytics, you can optimize your business on a\ndeeper level and increase the chances of sales.\n\nHowever, Amazon Brand Analytics does not provide you with everything.
