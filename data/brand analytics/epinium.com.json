That\u2019s why Amazon provides\nsellers with an invaluable tool: Amazon Brand Analytics.\n\nTabla de Contenido\n\nToggle\n\n  * What is Amazon Brand Analytics Tool?\n  * Difference between Amazon Brand Analytics and Amazon Brand Store Insights\n  * Who can use Amazon Brand Analytics?\n  * How do I access Amazon Brand Analytics?\n  * The importance of data\n  * What does Amazon Brand Analytics include?\n  * Benefits of Amazon Brand Analytics\n  * Key metrics to track in Amazon Brand Analytics\n  * Is Amazon Brand Analytics free?\n\n## What is Amazon Brand Analytics Tool?\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is an essential tool for any third-party seller\nparticipating in the Amazon Brand Registry programme. This tool provides\nvaluable information about customer search and purchase behaviour, as well as\nthe most viewed ASIN products on Amazon. Not only that, but it is also an\nessential resource that allows you to delve deeper into the world of Amazon\ndata. With this tool, you can get detailed information about how customers\ninteract with your products and your competitors\u2019 products on the Amazon\nmarketplace.\n\n## Difference between Amazon Brand Analytics and Amazon Brand Store Insights\n\nIt is important to know that Amazon Brand Analytics and Amazon Brand Store\nInsights are two different things on Amazon. Amazon Brand Store Insights\nfocuses on providing brands with valuable information about the performance of\nyour brand shop on Amazon. This includes data on page views, unique visitors,\nsales and conversion rates in your brand shop. This information is vital for\noptimising your shop layout, product offerings and marketing strategies, all\nwith the goal of improving your brand\u2019s overall performance on Amazon. On the\nother hand, Amazon Brand Analytics Tool focuses on providing Amazon sellers\nwith information about customer search and purchase behaviour, as well as the\nmost viewed ASIN products. This tool is not related to the performance of your\nbranded shop itself. The amazing thing is that you don\u2019t even need to have a\nbranded shop on Amazon to take full advantage of this tool.\n\n## Who can use Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nAccessibility to Amazon Brand Analytics Tool is one of the most frequently\nasked questions.
