And, if data is fuel, analytics is the combustion engine\nof a successful business, regardless of industry. When it comes to eCommerce,\naccurate reporting is critical, especially if you sell on a highly saturated\nmarketplace like Amazon.\n\nActionable data insights help merchants win their market share and spot\nopportunities for improvement, mapping their marketing strategies accordingly.\nWith that in mind, Amazon has made several updates to its Brand Analytics\nfeature, unveiling additional analytics tools and eliminating some others to\nhelp sellers turn their Amazon data into strategic assets.\n\nThis article breaks down how to use the updated Amazon brand analytics\ndashboard and uncovers the key metrics you should keep track of to boost your\nbrand performance.\n\nBut before we take a closer look at the reports offered within the Brand\nAnalytics dashboard, let\u2019s talk about why Amazon business data management and\nanalytics are important.\n\n##  First Things First: Why Is Analytics Critical for Your Amazon Business?\n\nSince no one can hit their target with their eyes closed, online sellers can\u2019t\ngo without credible data and the powerful insights derived from it. In terms\nof Amazon sales, the better your product data quality is, the better product\npages tend to perform.\n\nFor those who want to grow and expand their business on Amazon, retail\nanalytics is key.\n\nAt Seller Labs, we know the value of your data, and appreciate the time you\ntake to collect and interpret it. This is why we rolled out a powerful data\naggregation and data management tool capable of combining **all your Amazon\ndata** from various sources into one reliable database automatically \u2014  Seller\nLabs Data Warehouse.  \n\nWith single-view access to your Amazon business data, you can:\n\n  * identify best-selling products\n  * determine top-performing advertising campaigns\n  * analyze sales data\n  * stay ahead of your orders with inventory and order management \n  * determine the areas of your business that need improvement\n\nOur Data Warehouse helps brands get an instant, holistic view of their Amazon\nbusinesses. Furthermore, with our new Google Sheets extension, you can\ncustomize your Amazon Data in a Google Sheet right from within Seller Labs\nPRO. Currently in beta, this feature will help you save time, money, and\nenergy with better reporting and data automation.\n\n##  **Keep Tabs on Your Data with Seller Labs Data Warehouse**\n\nTry Our New Google Sheets Extension\n\nNot managing your product data effectively can lead to undesired actions, like\ncart abandonments, poor product discoverability, and a drop in sales. In\ncontrast, a well-performed Amazon sales data analysis enhances the entire\nonline business performance by driving conversions, winning the top spot in\nthe Amazon search results, and tracking buyers\u2019 behavior. And this is where we\nare coming closer to what data Amazon Brand Analytics provides.\n\n##  What Is Amazon Brand Analytics?\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics (ABA) is an exclusive suite of reports for brand owners\nthat unlocks actionable insights into buyers\u2019 purchase behavior and browsing\npatterns.\n\nWith the Amazon Brand Analytics tool, Amazon sellers can make informed\ndecisions and improve the overall brand performance by accessing the following\nreports:\n\n  * Amazon Search Terms\n  * Demographics\n  * Market Basket Analysis\n  * Repeat Purchase Behavior\n  * Search Catalog Performance\n  * Search Query Performance\n\n### Side note:\n\n **Effective June 30, 2022,** the Item Comparison and Alternate Purchase\nBehavior Report within Amazon Brand Analytics is no longer available.\nAccording to seller feedback, these dashboards didn\u2019t offer impactful and\nactionable insights, so Amazon eliminated them, exploring further\nopportunities to add deeper customer behavior analytics in 2023.  \n  \nAlthough there was no official announcement from Amazon, rumor has it that\nAmazon Search report will also be deprecated soon in favor of the newly-\nlaunched Amazon Search Analytics.  \n  \n\nThis enhanced analytics feature is available to sellers who own or are\ninternal to a brand on Amazon and are enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry\nprogram. Registered brand owners can access these reports through their Seller\nCentral home page by hovering over the \u201cBrands\u201d tab and clicking \u201cBrand\nAnalytics\u201d in the drop-down menu.\n\n##  An Overview of the Main Brand Analytics Reports\n\n###  Amazon Search Terms Report\n\nLet\u2019s face it: you can\u2019t build long-term brand awareness on wild guesses.\nTherefore, knowing what shoppers type into the Amazon search box while\nbrowsing for your products is critical. The Search Terms report shows the\nkeywords that potential Amazon customers enter to buy your products.\nFurthermore, it allows merchants to see the search terms shoppers use to find\ntheir competitors\u2019 items and see what percentage of the time their competition\nis getting clicked.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nThe crucial metrics available via this report are:\n\n  *  **Search terms** and the matching products that customers purchase. \n  *  **Search frequency rank** (SFR) is the numeric rank of a search term\u2019s popularity, contrasted to other search queries over a specified period. The lower the SFR, the more popular a search term is to shoppers. \n  *  **Click share determines the percentage of** clicks the product got compared to the total clicks based on the search results in the selected time frame.\n  *  **Conversion share** indicates the percentage of customers who bought the product after searching for a particular term.\n  *  **Clicked ASIN** shows the top three product ASINs that are most clicked for each search term that customers type into the Amazon search box.\n  *   **Product title** displays the product headline that received the most clicks for a given search term.\n\nThe Amazon keyword search report is an excellent resource for uncovering\nadditional search phrases, the most popular goods listed for every search\nterm, and the frequency of these specific terms. With this knowledge, sellers\ncan improve their product listings by targeting these keywords and optimizing\ndescriptions on the product detail page to generate more traffic.\n\n###  Demographics Report\n\nThe Demographics dashboard* allows brand owners to enhance their marketing\nefforts based on customer penetration by demographic. It provides the\naggregate breakdown of product purchases by **customer location, gender, age,\nhousehold income, and marital status**.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nSellers can view critical metrics such as the number of unique customers,\nordered product sales, and ordered units for each demographic segment. This\ndata helps you understand your main buyer persona and determine more efficient\ntargeted marketing campaigns.\n\n* _The Demographic report is only available to brand owners in the United States._\n\n###  Market Basket Analysis Report\n\nWith the Market Basket report, merchants can see related products shoppers\nfrequently buy in conjunction with the primary item.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nHere are the main three metrics of this report:\n\n  *  **Purchased ASIN** is the product that customers frequently buy along with yours.\n  *  **Purchased Title** shows the title of the Purchased ASIN associated with your brand product.\n  *  **Combination %** is the percentage of orders that contain both the brand owner\u2019s listed product and the competitor\u2019s most purchased product.\n\n **Side note** : The following formula calculates the combination percentage:\n\n **Orders containing both the product you offer and the related product\ndivided by the total number of orders and multiplied by 100**\n\nFor example, 2,000 orders out of 5,000 total contain the mobile phones you\nsell plus the memory cards. Then your combination percentage will amount to\n40%.\n\nThe higher the Combination %, the more frequently your products are bought\ntogether with the listed product. Please note that this metric isn\u2019t helpful\nunless your product has a high sales volume.\n\n> _If you have one sale and try to view the dashboard, that one sale may not\n> have had any associated purchases, so there will be no data. If you have ten\n> sales, you may have one sale with related purchases, but one out of ten\n> isn\u2019t a good indicator that these items are actually commonly purchased\n> together. But if you have 1000 sales and 500 of those have associated\n> purchases, you\u2019re finally seeing some data that could help you understand\n> what products are commonly purchased with your items._\n>\n> Jessica Wright  \n> Amazon Brand Strategist on the Seller Labs Services team\n\nThis data helps brand owners generate complementary product ideas to create\nnew bundles and increase cross-selling, ultimately leading to a higher average\norder value (AOV).\n\n###  Repeat Purchase Behavior Report\n\nAs the name suggests, this report allows sellers to identify the products most\nlikely to be purchased repeatedly. It also indicates the number of unique\ncustomers and the percentage of shoppers who bought the product several times.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nIn this report, you\u2019ll find:\n\n  * Number of orders for a product\n  * Number of unique customers who purchased that product\n  * Number of repeat customers (as a percentage of the total number of customers)\n  * Sales amount from repeat purchases\n  * Percentage of orders containing repeat purchases of the product\n\nKnowing which of your products are bestsellers gives you an insight into how\nto manage your inventory more effectively, allowing you to avoid expenses on\nthe items that don\u2019t sell well and invest in the products that better match\nbuyers\u2019 preferences.\n\n##  Amazon Search Analytics Dashboard\n\nOn top of the reports mentioned above comes the recently unveiled Search\nAnalytics dashboard. Available under the Brand Analytics tab, this tool gives\nsellers valuable insights into their product search performance.\n\nThe main features of this new dashboard are the Search Query Performance and\nSearch Catalog Performance reports that are currently available in the U.S.\nonly.\n\n###  Search Query Performance Dashboard\n\nThis report helps brand owners understand their customers\u2019 shopping behavior\nacross the entire shopping journey by analyzing the performance of the top\nqueries relevant to their brand. The data is available for three reporting\nperiods: weekly, monthly, and quarterly.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nKey data available from the search query performance report include:\n\n  *  **Query volume** is the number of times the query was searched for a given time period. \n  *  **Impressions** are the number of results that pop up when a shopper runs a search on Amazon.   \n  *  **Clicks** measure traffic, indicating how many shoppers interact with your products after a specific search query. \n  *  **Brand share** presents the total of clicks and impressions that your brand gets.\n  *  **Cart-Adds** show how often shoppers add your brand\u2019s products to their cart after performing the search query.\n  *  **Purchases** indicate the number of conversions per search query.\n\nWith the Search Query Performance report, merchants will access paid and\norganic data for each search query and get a 360-degree view of their keywords\nand search terms\u2019 performance. With these insights, you can understand the\ncompetitive landscape and meet customer intent by updating your listings for\nSEO to get more organic traffic. The search query data also helps sellers\ncatch trends early and identify opportunities to introduce new products.\n\n###  Search Catalog Performance Dashboard\n\nWhile the Search Query Performance tool provides you with information that led\nto your brand interaction for the first 1,000 search queries, the Search\nCatalog Performance report shows you the same KPIs (impressions, clicks, cart-\nadds, and purchases), but this time at the product level.\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nWith this data, merchants get deeper insights into each stage of their\nproducts\u2019 sales funnel to identify main conversion issues and drop-off points.\nFor example, after spotting a poorly performing product, they can investigate\nthe potential purchase barriers, adjust a competitive price, and optimize the\nproduct detail page content, ultimately improving conversion rates.\n\n **Important note:** Some sellers may notice that the search total sales do\nnot match the sponsored product sales or order reports.\n\nAnd here\u2019s why:\n\nThe total purchases attributed to organic and sponsored in the Catalog\nPerformance Dashboard use a 24-hour period attribution meaning the impressions\nclicks, cart-adds, and purchases should have occurred within this timeframe.\nThis is different from how all other dashboards\u2019 metrics are calculated. While\ncomparing two different dashboard data sets, please note that the search\ntraffic sales are not your total sales number, but the sales number originated\nfrom the search results.\n\n##  Recent & Upcoming Amazon Launches\n\nAmazon is planning to roll out some additional features and tools as part of\nthe Amazon Brand Analytics Dashboard by the end of this year.\n\n **1.** **Product Opportunity Explorer**helps Amazon sellers better understand\nbuyers\u2019 needs and purchase behavior to identify the unmet customer demand and\ngenerate new product ideas. This feature is only available to registered brand\nowners. They can access the tool by opening the Seller Central main menu,\nhovering over to \u201cGrowth\u201d, and selecting \u201cProduct Opportunity Explorer\u201d.\n\nTo help you unlock new product opportunities, the tool collects the search\nterms and products to define market niches representing the specific customer\nneed. Each niche has a detail page providing additional information like\nproducts within the niche, search terms, and statistics about new product\nlaunch potential. Niche metrics are refreshed at the beginning of each week,\nand new niches are created at the start of each month.\n\nSellers can find the niche of their liking with the following filtering\noptions:\n\nSource: Seller Central\n\nWith Product and Opportunity Explorer, brand owners can analyze the intensity\nof competition and see which niches are not filled yet to introduce new\nproducts there.\n\n **2\\. Search Metrics Glossary** will help merchants understand what the\nmetrics mean and how they are calculated to interpret and implement the data\nmore efficiently.\n\nThe glossary will be easy to find from different points of access across the\ndashboards, and it will include a detailed explanation of each metric, as you\ncan see in the example for the Purchases Total Count:\n\nSource: _Amazon Accelerate 2022_\n\n **3\\. Query Performance ASIN View** is part of the Search Query Performance\ndashboard, which helps sellers understand the customer demand and the\nperformance of each of your products.\n\nThis dashboard includes the same number of metrics as the brand view and shows\nthe top search queries associated with the selected ASIN. With this\ninformation, merchants can enhance their product listing based on the search\nterms used in the query.\n\n **4\\. Search Dashboards Worldwide Launch.** Amazon is planning to expand\naccess to Search Query Dashboards to eighteen marketplaces one at a time by\nthe end of the year.\n\n**5\\. Downloads and Insights**. Merchants will be able to export search\nperformance datasets to infer trends and insights with all the required\ninformation at hand.\n\nAmazon says there will be two download options:\n\n  1.  **Simple View** will include data displayed in the dashboard according to your selected filters and columns.   \n  2.  **Comprehensive View** will consider only two filters: brand and reporting range. It will include many more queries than a thousand-limit imposed by the UX.\n\nThe initial release will allow sellers to download data in the CSV format, but\nAmazon is also planning to expand to other formats, such as Excel, in the\nfuture.\n\n##  FAQs\n\n**1. **Is Amazon Brand Analytics free?****\n\n **Yes.** Brand owners can use Amazon Brand Analytics absolutely for free. The\nonly eligibility requirement is to be enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry\nprogram.\n\n **2. **Which products do the Brand Analytics reports display?****\n\nThe reports include only the products that are enrolled in Amazon Brand\nRegistry. They also show the competitors\u2019 ASINs for the items associated with\nthe brand owner\u2019s registered products.\n\n **3. **How can I gain access to the Product Opportunity Explorer?****\n\nOpportunity Explorer is available to Professional sellers in the US, Germany,\nUK, France, Italy, and Spain. If you are not a Professional seller, view the\nSelling Plan Comparison and upgrade to a Professional account. Within 24 hours\nafter the upgrade, you\u2019ll be granted access to the Product Opportunity\nExplorer tool.\n\n##  Summing Up\n\nWhen it comes to making informed strategic decisions, having access to\naccurate data is a huge deal. Knowing how to interpret and implement these\nvaluable assets is even more important. By analyzing your brand performance at\nthe ASIN level, you can spot the areas for improvement and take action to:\n\n  * build an efficient advertising strategy to outperform the competition;\n  * level up your product targeting and improve the relevance of your PPC campaigns; \n  * enhance the descriptions on your product detail page with A+ Content;\n  * add compelling multimedia content to highlight the unique selling points of your product.\n\nAt Seller Labs, we know about the Amazon seller\u2019s primary challenge of\njuggling multiple tasks simultaneously.
