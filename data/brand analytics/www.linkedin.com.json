M.\n\n###  M. M.\n\n####  E-commerce Strategy Architect | Data Analysis, Online Sales Management,\nPPC Expertise | I Help E-commerce Brands: PPC Revenue $13k to $165k &\nConversions +1308%\n\nPublished Aug 18, 2023\n\n\\+ Follow\n\nMeet Rosie. An entrepreneur selling plush toys on Amazon, she's keen to delve\ndeeper into her customer insights. While third-party seller tools have served\nher well, Rosie now aspires to achieve greatness.\n\nEnter the world of Amazon Brand Analytics (ABA).\n\nIn this guide, we unveil how ABA can be the key to unlocking profound insights\nabout your customers. Let's explore how this tool can be pivotal for boosting\nconversions, optimizing product details, and skyrocketing sales.\n\n **Understanding Amazon Brand Analytics** Amazon Brand Analytics is a treasure\ntrove for sellers. It illuminates brand insights through detailed analysis of\ncustomer search, purchasing patterns, and ASIN connections. Armed with this\nknowledge, sellers can refine their marketing techniques and products for\nheightened brand visibility and sales.\n\n **Quick Fact:** The Amazon marketplace is teeming with over 6 million third-\nparty sellers, with around 2,000 more jumping on board daily! By capitalizing\non ABA, you can set yourself apart and rise above the competition.\n\nIntroduced in 2019, ABA began as an exclusive tool for a select group but has\nsince expanded its reach. It's now available across multiple Amazon\nmarketplaces, from Amazon.com to Amazon.fr and beyond.\n\n **Differentiating Between Amazon Brand Store Insights & ABA** Amazon Brand\nStore Insights and Amazon Brand Analytics are distinct tools within Seller\nCentral.\n\nThe former is a goldmine for brands wanting to understand their Amazon store's\nmetrics like visitor counts, conversion rates, and sales, aiding them in\noptimizing store performance. However, this requires owning a brand store on\nAmazon.\n\nContrastingly, ABA delves into insights about customer search and purchasing\nbehaviors without being tied to a specific store's performance. And the best\npart? No brand store requirement!\n\n **Who's Eligible for ABA?** Amazon Brand Analytics is primarily for third-\nparty private label sellers registered under the Amazon Brand Registry\nprogram. This means wholesalers, dropshippers, and even Kindle authors are\nleft out.\n\nTo break it down:\n\n  * Be an active Amazon seller.\n\n  * Own a brand.\n\n  * Sell your brand's products and not resell.\n\n  * Enrollment in the Amazon Brand Registry program is a must.\n\nHowever, a lack of registered trademark isn\u2019t a dealbreaker. Those without\ntrademarks can still benefit from ABA as long as they're a part of the Amazon\nBrand Registry program.\n\n **ABA Seller Central vs. Vendor Central** Amazon vendors get a different\nanalytics flavor via Vendor Central known as Amazon Retail Analytics (ARA).\nThe distinguishing factor between ARA and ABA is their target audience: ARA\nfor vendors and ABA for brand-registered sellers.\n\nARA presents vendors with an expansive data spectrum, offering added reports\nsuch as the Marketing Dashboard. Some ARA-exclusive reports encompass:\n\n  *  **Detail Page Sales and Traffic Report:** Breakdown of sales and traffic metrics by ASIN.\n\n  *  **Product and Customer Metrics Report:** Sales and traffic data categorized by demographics.\n\n  *  **Operational Efficiency Reports:** Metrics focusing on shipping, order fulfillment, and returns.\n\n  *  **Financial Reports:** Inclusive of invoicing and payment details.\n\nBoth tools cater to their specific audience's needs, offering insights\ntailored for optimization.\n\n **The Cost of ABA? Zero!** Surprisingly, Amazon Brand Analytics is\ncomplimentary. As long as your seller account and Amazon Brand Registry status\nare active, you're set!\n\nWhy does Amazon offer this valuable tool for free? There's a strategy:\n\n  1.  **Brand Registry Incentive:** Offering ABA for free can lure more brands to register on Amazon, consolidating its dominant stance in e-commerce.\n\n  2.  **Improved Listings:** By equipping sellers with these insights, Amazon ensures superior product listings, enriching the overall customer experience.\n\n  3.  **Data Utilization:** Amazon's terms grant them permission to utilize this data, honing their marketplace, services, and ads.\n\nAmazon's foresight in offering ABA for free is indeed a masterstroke in the\nevolving e-commerce narrative!\n\n### How to Access Amazon Brand Analytics from Your Seller Account\n\nSo how do you even access Amazon Brand Analytics? Simple, just follow these 4\nquick steps to get started:\n\n  1. Step #1: Get brand registered on Amazon. Check out our in-depth Amazon Brand Registry guide for more details. Make sure you, at least, have a pending trademark registration before you apply for Amazon Brand Registry. All US sellers must submit their trademark applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  \n\n  1. Step #2: Log in to Seller Central\n\n  1. Step #3: Navigate to the main menu from the Seller Central home screen\n\n  1. Step #4: Select Brands > Brand Analytics from the main menu to launch the ABA tool\n\nSometimes, when you first attempt to access the Brand Analytics tool, you\nmight find it's not immediately available. Don't worry, this is a common\noccurrence. Simply reach out to the Amazon seller support team by opening a\ncase, and they'll assist you in resolving the issue.\n\nNow, let's delve into the types of reports you can access within the Amazon\nBrand Analytics dashboard.\n\n### 6 Types of Amazon Brand Analytics Reports\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics provides a comprehensive suite of six analytical\nreports (or dashboards) to help sellers optimize their strategy. These reports\nare:\n\n  1.  **Search Catalog Performance Report:** This report analyzes the performance of your catalog based on various search queries. It helps you understand which products in your catalog are the most sought after by users and how well they rank for specific keywords.\n\n  2.  **Search Query Performance Report:** This report provides insights into how your products are performing for specific search queries. It can tell you which keywords drive the most traffic to your listings and which ones lead to actual sales.\n\n  3.  **Top Search Terms Report:** Here, you can see the most frequently used search terms by customers on Amazon. Knowing these can help you adjust your listings or ad campaigns to target these popular keywords.\n\n  4.  **Repeat Purchase Behavior Report:** This report sheds light on the buying patterns of your customers. By understanding which products are often bought more than once, you can tailor promotions or bundle offers to encourage repeat purchases.\n\n  5.  **Market Basket Analysis Report:** This analyzes products that are frequently bought together. This can be instrumental in setting up \"frequently bought together\" promotions or creating bundles that cater to common buying patterns.\n\n  6.  **Demographics Report:** This report provides a breakdown of your customers by demographics like age, gender, and location. This can be invaluable in tailoring your marketing strategies to specific audience segments.\n\nTogether, these reports offer a 360-degree view of customer behavior, helping\nsellers fine-tune their product listings, pricing, promotions, and marketing\ncampaigns.\n\n **Delving into Amazon Brand Analytics Reports**\n\n **Search Analytics Dashboards:** The Search Catalog Performance Report and\nthe Search Query Performance Report are geared towards understanding the\nintricacies of search patterns. They equip you with the ability to\nmeticulously assess how the ASINs associated with your brand perform during\ncustomer searches on Amazon.\n\n **Search Catalog Performance Report:** This specific report illuminates how\nyour products are navigating the intricate labyrinth of the search-based\nshopping process on Amazon. By furnishing a side-by-side comparison of your\nproducts' performance, it provides a clear view of which ASINs might be\nunderachieving. This becomes an invaluable tool for sellers with offerings in\nsimilar categories or niches. By recognizing which items are garnering\ninterest and which are trailing behind, you're empowered to recalibrate your\nlisting optimization techniques.\n\n **Search Query Performance Report:** While we haven't delved deeply into this\nreport yet, it likely zeroes in on the particular search terms that usher the\nmost traffic to your product listings. This data reveals not only the high-\nperforming keywords but also the search intentions of potential buyers,\nallowing you to refine your product's keyword strategy accordingly.\n\n **Consumer Behavior Dashboards:** The subsequent four reports are carved out\nto unravel the layers of consumer behavior and detect the prevailing market\npulses on Amazon.\n\n **Top Search Terms Report:** This dashboard sheds light on the search terms\nmost frequently keyed in by Amazon shoppers. Aligning your product listings\nwith these terms can elevate your product's visibility.\n\n **Repeat Purchase Behavior Report:** A peek into which of your products get\nsnapped up multiple times can guide your promotional endeavors. Recognizing\nrepeat purchase trends can pave the way for devising offers like bundle\ndiscounts or loyalty programs.\n\n **Market Basket Analysis Report:** By decoding the combinations in which\nproducts are usually bought, you can curate enticing product bundles or\nsuggest items that complement each other, enriching the buyer's shopping\njourney.\n\n **Demographics Report:** By serving insights segmented by age, gender, or\nlocation, this dashboard amplifies your potential to mold marketing endeavors\nto specific audience groups for maximum impact.\n\n **An Important Update:** It's imperative to keep pace with Amazon's evolving\ntools. A case in point is the Item Comparison and Alternate Purchase Behavior\nReport which was a feature of the older Amazon Brand Analytics toolset.\nHowever, in June 2022, Amazon decided to phase out this dashboard,\nunderscoring the platform's ever-evolving nature and emphasizing the need for\nsellers to remain updated for maximizing utility.\n\nYou can get the Search Catalog Report over multiple reporting ranges,\nincluding weekly, monthly, and quarterly. The product views are limited to\n10,000 ASINs at a time, with the metrics having a 24-hr attribution period.\n\nBelow is a list of the important metrics available inside the Search Catalog\nPerformance dashboard:\n\n  * Impressions\n\n  * Clicks\n\n  * Click\n\n  *   *  Rate (CTR)\n\n  * Cart adds\n\n  * Purchases\n\n  * Conversion rate\n\n _The Need to Know:_ The ABA tool and the Brand Analytics reports don\u2019t\naccount for the hits generated through PPC ads displayed as widgets or on\nproduct detail pages. Make sure to keep this in mind when analyzing the\nnumbers to guide your strategy.\n\n  1. Search Query Performance Report\n\nNext, you have the Search Query Performance Report. This report shows you the\ntop 1000 queries that led customers to your brand and allows you to analyze\nthe performance of each of those search queries across the complete shopping\nfunnel.\n\nYou get two views under the Search Query Performance dashboard: i) Brand view,\nand ii) ASIN view. Meanwhile, the reporting range varies from weekly to\nquarterly. The Search Query Performance report is arguably the most important\nreport available inside the Amazon Brand Analytics manager.\n\nBelow are some critical metrics you can find in the report:\n\n  * Total count\n\n  * Click rate\n\n  * Brand count\n\n  * Brand share\n\n _For What It\u2019s Worth:_ Unsure what the different metrics mean for the ABA\nreport you are analyzing? You can always consult the Metric Glossary section\nto view the definitions of the important terms across the different Amazon\nBrand Analytics reports.\n\n  1. Repeat Purchase Behavior Report\n\nThe Repeat Purchase Behavior Report provides insights into repeat purchase and\ncustomer retention patterns by ASIN or brand. You can get a comprehensive\nbreakdown of your unique and repeat purchases at revenue, order, and customer\nlevels and make data-driven decisions to increase brand loyalty and improve\nyour bottom line.\n\nHere are some important metrics worth tracking when analyzing the Repeat\nPurchase Behavior Report:\n\n  * Sales\n\n  * Units\n\n  * Repeat Customers\n\n  * Change vs. Prior Period\n\n  * % Share of total sales\n\n  1. Demographics Report\n\nYou also get the Demographics Report inside Amazon Brand Analytics. As the\nname implies, this report shows you the demographic spread of the users who\npurchase from your brand on the Amazon marketplace. You need a minimum of 100\nunique customers in the selected reporting range for the data to become\navailable.\n\nUsing the Demographics Report, sellers can understand their target audience\nbetter and learn more about their age, salary, education, and gender. The\nreport is currently available in the US marketplace only.\n\n  1. Top Search Terms Report\n\nAlso known as the Amazon Search Terms Report, this dashboard provides\nvisibility into the top search terms for the products sold on the Amazon\nmarketplace. The search terms are sorted by the Search Frequency Rank (SFR)\nand can be filtered for relevant departments. Sellers can navigate to the\nsearch terms of their interest and check the top three ASINs that get the most\nclicks and conversions against them.\n\nIt\u2019s quite interesting to see the difference between the Top Search Terms\nReport and the Search Query Performance Report. The latter shows data for the\nsearch terms that are relevant to your brand only, while the Amazon Search\nTerms dashboard gives you a market-level breakdown for all the popular search\nterms on the marketplace. You can get the report for daily, weekly, monthly,\nand quarterly reporting periods.\n\nBelow are some important metrics to track inside the Amazon Search Terms\nReport:\n\n  * Search Frequency Rank\n\n  * Click Share\n\n  * Conversion Share\n\n  1. Market Basket Analysis Report\n\nLast but not least, you have the Market Basket Analysis Report. This report\nshows you the top three ASINs frequently bought together with your product,\nuncovering interesting insights about your customers\u2019 shopping behavior.\n\nSellers can select from weekly, monthly, and quarterly reporting periods when\nrequesting the Market Basket Report for their brand.  However, quarterly\nranges are usually preferred for a more holistic analysis.\n\n### Can You Download the Amazon Brand Analytics Sheets for Offline Viewing?\n\nYes, you can download the Amazon Brand Analytics sheets for offline viewing,\nanytime you want. All the downloaded reports and their status can be found\ninside the Download Manager, available at the top of the ABA dashboard.\n\n### Amazon Attribution (Beta) \u2013 An Additional Brand Analytics Feature\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics also allows sellers to measure the impact of their non-\nAmazon online marketing channels on their total Amazon sales through the\nAmazon Attribution tool. You need to register for this tool separately from\ninside Seller Central. Once enabled, you can access it from the Brand\nAnalytics dashboard.\n\nThe tool works by providing unique tracking URLs that sellers can use in their\ndigital advertising campaigns outside of Amazon, such as Facebook or website\ndisplay ads. When a customer clicks on one of these tracking URLs and makes a\npurchase on Amazon, the purchase is attributed back to the corresponding\nadvertising campaign.\n\nAmazon Attribution provides insights into how your non-Amazon digital\nmarketing efforts are driving sales on Amazon, which can help you optimize\nyour advertising campaigns to maximize your return on investment (ROI).\nAdditionally, it allows you to understand your entire customer journey from\ninitial engagement with a non-Amazon ad to the final purchase on Amazon, which\ncan help you better understand your target audience and improve your marketing\nstrategies.\n\n### How to Use Amazon Brand Analytics to Optimize Your Strorefront\n\nFinally, here are some of the use cases of the Amazon Brand Analytics reports:\n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Listing Optimization\n\nYou can use the different reports inside Amazon Brand Analytics to optimize\nyour listing. For example, using the Search Performance Query Report, you can\ndiscover all the different keywords that are bringing traffic to your listing.\nYou can then identify and shortlist the ones that are not already added to\nyour listing and incorporate them to boost your Amazon SEO and organic\nrankings.\n\nLikewise, you can use the Amazon Search Terms Report to find the related\nsearch terms (or popular variants) of your primary keyword and add them to\nyour listing copy to improve product visibility and search performance.  \n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Effective PPC Management\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics can also help you spot issues in your PPC campaigns and\nmanage them more effectively. For example, you can use the Search Performance\nQuery Report data to find cannibalized keywords part of your live ads and drop\nthem to reduce your PPC burn.\n\nWondering how?\n\nSimply, go to the Search Performance Query Report and make a list of all the\nrelated keywords with high impressions. Next, pause the ad campaigns for those\nkeywords and see if there is any significant drop in the engagements. The\nmetrics for the cannibalized set of keywords should remain largely unaffected.  \n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Product Research\n\nRemember the Market Basket Analysis Report and how it shows you frequently\nbought together ASINs alongside your product? Well, you can use those insights\nto find cross-selling and bundling ideas for your product line and expand your\nbusiness further.\n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics for Sales Optimization\n\nWith Amazon Brand Analytics, you can even optimize your storefront sales. For\nexample, using the Search Catalog Performance Report, you can analyze and\ncompare different ASINs in your product catalog across their search shopping\nfunnels and identify where they might be lacking. You can then isolate the\nproblem area and narrow down your workings to find an effective solution.  \n\nIf the products are in the same niche, you can even replicate some of the\nstrategies that are working for your other ASINs to fix the broken funnel. Why\nreinvent the wheel, eh?\n\nSimilarly, you can use the findings from the Repeat Purchase Behavior Report\nand identify products that your target audience often likes to purchase from\nyou. These products can have a Subscribe & Save option to boost your repeat\nsales.  \n\n### Amazon Brand Analytics Key Benefits\n\n  *  **Provides first-hand, accurate marketplace data:** Amazon Brand Analytics provides first-hand and accurate marketplace data, sourced directly from Amazon's internal metrics and reporting tools. This data includes information on customer behavior, search patterns, and purchasing habits on the platform. With this data, sellers and brands can gain a better understanding of their customers and the market, allowing them to make informed decisions about their sales and marketing strategies. Accurate and reliable data is crucial for making effective business decisions, and Amazon Brand Analytics provides sellers and brands with a wealth of valuable information.\n\n  *  **Market-wide reporting, not limited to your ASINs only:** The ABA tool takes analysis to a whole new level by providing market-wide reporting without limiting sellers to data points specific to their brands or brands\u2019 ASINs only. This means that sellers and brands can access insights into the broader market and their competitors, allowing them to identify trends and opportunities for growth. For example, the Amazon Search Terms Report provides insight into the search terms that customers are using to find products on Amazon and breaks down the top 3 clicked ASINs for each. This way, sellers and brands can study the overall market and optimize their product listings for increased visibility and sales. By providing market-wide reporting, Amazon Brand Analytics enables sellers and brands to make data-driven decisions that will benefit their business.\n\n  *  **Is free to use:** One of the significant benefits of Amazon Brand Analytics is that it is free to use for registered brand owners and professional sellers. This means that even small and medium-sized businesses can access valuable data and insights to optimize their Amazon sales and marketing strategies, without incurring additional costs. Amazon Brand Analytics provides a range of tools and reports that sellers can use to gain a competitive edge and increase sales for no additional investment.\n\n  *  **Analyze and optimize multiple aspects of your ecommerce business:** Amazon Brand Analytics provides a wide range of tools and reports that allow sellers and brands to analyze and optimize multiple aspects of their ecommerce business. This includes product performance, customer behavior, search patterns, and advertising campaigns. With this data, sellers and brands can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to supercharge their business. For example, the Repeat Purchase Behavior report can provide insights into customer loyalty and retention, allowing sellers and brands to develop targeted marketing strategies to increase repeat purchases and customer lifetime value.\n\n### Other Useful Amazon Brand-Specific Features\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is not the only feature you get when you enroll in the\nAmazon Brand Registry program. Here are some other useful features worth\nexploring:\n\n  * Amazon Transparency\n\n  * Amazon A+ Content\n\n  * Virtual Bundles\n\n **Final Key Takeaway:**\n\nAmazon Brand Analytics is a robust suite of tools designed to empower sellers\nwith insights into search patterns and consumer behaviors on the platform. By\neffectively harnessing the data from these dashboards, sellers can refine\ntheir product listings, optimize marketing strategies, and stay attuned to the\ndynamic landscape of Amazon. However, it's crucial to stay updated with the\nplatform's evolving offerings, as demonstrated by the discontinuation of\ncertain reports. Staying informed and adapting to these changes is pivotal for\nsellers aiming for success on Amazon.\n\nAmazon PPC Methods & Strategy\n\n###  Amazon PPC Methods & Strategy\n\n####  5,331 followers\n\n\\+ Subscribe\n\n`` `` `` ``\n\nLike\n\nLike\n\nCelebrate\n\nSupport\n\nLove\n\nInsightful\n\nFunny\n\nComment\n\n`` ``\n\n  * Copy\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nShare\n\n7  `` `` `` `` `` `` `` 1 Comment\n\nJairo Fuentes\n\n\\--\n\n3mo\n\n  * Report this comment \n\nGreat article.
