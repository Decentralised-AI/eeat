But what exactly is it?\nHow much will a ransom attack cost a business?\n\nAs we close out the year, it\u2019s safe to say that ransomware attacks are now the\nnorm. Over the last 11 months, threat actors have consistently demanded ransom\npayments that add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions.\n\nIn fact, we saw the highest ransom demand this year when the notorious REvil\ngang demanded a ransom of $70 million from Kaseya. Having said that, it\u2019s\nimportant to note that the ransom itself only makes up a small percentage of\nthe overall costs.\n\nWhile major ransom demands continue to hog the headlines, we don\u2019t hear about\nmost ransomware attacks\u2014many of which target small and medium-sized businesses\n(SMBs) and organizations. For SMBs, the recovery costs can be staggering and,\nat times, even crippling.\n\n## What is ransomware?\n\nRansomware is essentially a subset of malicious code or malware that can\npenetrate computers, devices, or networks and limits access to critical data\nby encrypting files. The objective is to force the victim to pay a ransom to\ndecrypt the files.\n\nThe pandemic and the rise of remote work have helped accelerate ransomware\nattacks by 148%. So, you can bet that ransomware will continue to plague\nbusinesses across industries in the new year.\n\n## Ransomware is evolving\n\nLike the coronavirus, ransomware is also rapidly evolving and now behaves\ndifferently. This makes it vital to adapt and adopt new methods to combat this\nthreat. For example, it\u2019ll help incorporate real-time monitoring and smart\nbehavioral analytics to ensure early detection.\n\nYou must also boost your efforts to proactively predict and anticipate risks\n(rather than just waiting for an attack to happen to respond). As hackers\ncontinue to penetrate mobile devices and more, the stakes are higher than ever\nbefore.\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is also on the rise. RaaS, like any software-\nas-a-service business model, enables affiliates to leverage advanced tools to\ninitiate an attack. The decentralized nature of these attacks also makes it\ndifficult to shut down.\n\nAs the tools\u2019 creators take a percentage of ransomware payments, the average\nransom demanded by cybercriminals has also increased by as much as 33%. The\nowners of the RaaS usually make about 20% of the total ransomware payment. As\nsuch, with criminals operating like some of the leading corporations in the\nworld, we can only expect it to get much worse.\n\nWhile ransom payments can be significant, the actual costs of a ransomware\nattack are harder to quantify. This is because we must calculate the cost of\ndowntime, device costs, network costs, lost opportunities, damage to brand\nreputation, and much more. According to Sophos, the total cost of recovery\nfrom an average ransomware attack added up to $1.85 million this year.\n\n## How to prevent a ransomware attack?\n\nThere are a few ways to mitigate the risk of a ransomware attack:\n\n### Train all staff regularly\n\nAs humans remain the weakest link on the security chain, training your\nemployees regularly is vital to corporate security. This approach will help\nthem stay vigilant to a potential social engineering attack. By doing this\nregularly, you can ensure that they stay up to date on the latest security\ntrends and develop a security-focused culture.\n\nRegular cybersecurity training will help your employees identify suspicious\ncommunications. Whether it\u2019s a social engineering attack via email or through\nan instant messaging platform, never click on suspicious links!\n\n### Enforce a Zero Trust security model\n\nAlways assume that your perimeter defenses will fail and take an active\napproach to secure your infrastructure. The zero-trust security model demands\nthat you authenticate all devices and users that attempt to connect to your\nnetwork.\n\nThis means they have to be verified every time they connect, not just once.\nIt\u2019s also important to actively monitor your environment and control user\naccess. This means that users should only have access to what they need to do\ntheir job and nothing else.\n\n### Have a disaster and recovery plan and offsite backups\n\nAlways have a robust disaster and recovery plan. This approach will help your\nteam go right to work during an active security event. Everyone will know what\nto do to stop the attack and prevent further damage.\n\nBackups are critical to ensure business continuity. So, make sure to backup\nall sensitive and operational data to get your system back up and running as\nsoon as possible. In this scenario, it\u2019s critical to limit access to your\nbackups as ransomware gangs will be looking for it. However, it\u2019s important to\nnote that backups can\u2019t help if the hacker exfiltrated the data and threatened\nto make it public.\n\n### Always use endpoint protections\n\nAlways scan incoming emails and filter them for malicious attachments and\nlinks. In this case, it\u2019s crucial to always keep your firewalls and endpoint\ndetection protocols updated with the latest malware signatures.\n\n### Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nIt goes without saying that password security is important. As such, always\nuse strong passwords and leverage MFA. This approach will make it harder for\nransomware gangs to infiltrate and lock your system.\n\n### Leverage encryption, always\n\nIf threat actors decide to steal your data, encryption is your last line of\ndefense. You never know how an active security event will play out, and it\nhelps to have all your bases covered in the event of an attack.\n\n### Hire an ethical hacking service\n\nFinally, one of the best ways to stay a step ahead of bad actors is to think\nlike one. So, hire an ethical hacking service to identify potential\nvulnerabilities missed by your in-house security team.\n\nWhether we like it or not, ransomware is rampant. We all need to take a\nproactive approach and consistently follow cybersecurity best practices to\nmitigate risk and ensure business continuity.\n\nDo you need help securing your digitally transformed infrastructure?
