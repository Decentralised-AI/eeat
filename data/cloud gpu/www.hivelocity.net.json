If you\u2019re like most business\nleaders, graphics processing units, or GPUs, may not be the first hardware\nadd-ons that spring to mind, but they\u2019re definitely worth your attention.\n\nGPU dedicated server implementations have numerous advantages over their CPU-\nonly counterparts. Here are some of the reasons to make the transition to\nGPGPU, or general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.\n\nGPU Dedicated Server during boot from Hivelocity.\n\n**The Benefits of GPU Offloading**\n\nIf your server isn\u2019t creating the graphics that your end-users see, then why\ndoes it need a GPU? Manufacturers design GPUs for fast 3-D processing,\naccurate floating-point arithmetic and error-free number crunching. Although\nthey typically operate at slower clock speeds, they have thousands of cores\nthat enable them to execute thousands of individual threads simultaneously.\n\n**You Get to Save Your CPU for the Big Stuff**\n\nRunning computationally intensive tasks on a CPU can tie up the whole system.\nOffloading some of this work to a GPU is a great way to free up resources and\nmaintain consistent performance.\n\nInterestingly, you can just send the toughest workloads to your GPU while the\nCPU handles the main sequential processes. Such GPGPU strategies are critical\nto delivering better services that cater to end users, who experience\naccelerated performance.\n\n**Big Data Thrives in Parallel Environments**\n\nMany of the Big Data tasks that create business value involve performing the\nsame operations repetitively. The wealth of cores available in GPU server\nhosting lets you conduct this kind of work by splitting it up between\nprocessors to crunch through voluminous data sets at a quicker rate.\n\n**Improved Power Consumption**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an eco-conscious company to benefit from energy-efficient\ncomputing. GPU-equipped systems that use less energy to accomplish the same\ntasks place lower demands on the supplies that power them. In specific use\ncases a GPU can provide the same data processing ability of 400 servers with\nCPU only.\n\n**  \nSoftware Compatibility**\n\nMany modern software packages support GPGPU acceleration. A few even let you\nparallelize your existing code by including hints that tell the compiler where\nto offload work to the GPU. Of course, you may need to optimize certain parts\nof your applications, but when it\u2019s this easy to take advantage of parallel\ncomputing, there\u2019s no reason to hold back.\n\n**You Can Give Your Machine Learning Processes a Head Start**\n\nTasks that rely on deep-learning and other AI training methods benefit greatly\nfrom GPGPU. GPU dedicated server devices can feed developing algorithms huge\nvolumes of data in parallel. This capacity makes it much easier to teach your\nsoftware how to recognize the trends and patterns that you\u2019re interested in\nanalyzing.\n\n**Get Started With GPU Server Hosting**\n\nGPU dedicated server hardware from Hivelocity makes it easy to leverage up to\neight PNY Nvidia Quadro or Nvidia Tesla GPUs in a single server (AMD GPUs\ncoming soon). What will you do with the freedom to use thousands of computing\ncores in parallel? To learn more about the possibilities, talk to a Hivelocity\nexpert today.\n\n###  1 thought on \u201cBenefits of a GPU Dedicated Server\u201d\n\n  1. **Jack Stiekema**\n\nFebruary 16, 2021 at 2:46 am\n\nMorning,\n\nWe need a hosted GPU server:  \n1 NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU  \n4 vCPU  \n16 GB RAM  \n200 GB Storage\n\nPlease a quotation.\n\nMet vriendelijke groet/Kind regards\n\nKind regards,  \nJack Stiekema  \n+31619189895\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Comment Cancel Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
