On top of that, we always focus on delivering\npremium customer experiences.\n\nWhat is required to register a domain?\n\nMany Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) have requirements to protect the\nintegrity of their namespace. However, most are free to be used by anyone in\nthe world. It is best to check the local presence requirements for specific\ndomains during the domain name application process. In some cases, SeiMaxim\nDomain Directors can act as an agent on your behalf to secure the domain for\nyou.\n\nHow to search for domain name?\n\nSearch your domain name, enter the second-level domain, and the domain\nextension in the SeiMaxim Domain name search field. Once you use our domain\nname lookup and find a suitable web address, you can point your domain to the\nwebsite hosting server\u2019s IP.\n\nHow to select a domain name?\n\nLots of people assume that they need the .com extension for every domain.\nWhile it is still considered the gold standard, hundreds of other domain\noptions exist out there. These can be excellent choices to add clever branding\nto your website or to expand your search. At SeiMaxim, we have a page\ndedicated to all of the new TLDs.\n\nIf you already have a business or brand, your domain should match your name.\nIf the .com domain is taken, you can try an alternate TLD, but be sure not to\nput yourself in another company\u2019s shadow or infringe on their trademark. Make\nsure no one holds a trademark on the proposed domain name.\n\nMake sure your domain is easy to spell and pronounce and doesn\u2019t contain any\nstrange letter substitutions or omissions that will make it difficult to\nremember. Hyphens are also usually not a great idea because people forget\nabout them. Do any online survey to ensure the domain name does not appear as\na username on major social media sites.\n\nThings to consider while buying a domain;\n\n  * The domain name should be short.\n  * No unexpected associations.\n  * The domain name should be memorable.\n  * People should spell it easily.\n  * Should not spell anything strange.\n  * It should not be similar to a social account.\n  * Consider new TLDs that fit your brand.\n\n## Companion for your .COM Domain\n\n##### WordPress\n\nFastest management platform for your websites.\n\nView all WordPress Hosting Plans\n\n## .COM Domain information\n\n**TLD**|  **COM**  \n---|---  \nType| GTLD  \nMinimum Registration Period| 1 year  \nMaximum Registration Period| 10 years  \nMinimum Renewal Period| 1 year  \nMaximum Renewal Period| 1 year  \nDNSEEC Support| YES  \nDomain Privacy| YES  \nIDN Support| YES  \nRegistrar Lock Support| YES  \nPrice| $9  \nICANN Fees| $0.18  \n  \n## Still Cannot Find The Domain You are Looking For?\n\n**.INFO**\n\nBuy Now\n\n**.COM**\n\nBuy Now\n\n**.ORG**\n\nBuy Now\n\n**.NET**\n\nBuy Now\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n  * DNSSEC is available free of cost with all eligible domains.\n  * You will receive a domain privacy subscription free with every eligible domain registration or transfer.
