There seems to be\nconfusion online when I read about the GPU requirement. On the other hand it\nlooks like some docker image have fixed this issue by adding the xvfb library\nin their build like https://gitlab.com/tedtramonte/core-keeper-server\n\nAny success story running this on a headless server or any recommendation?\n\nThanks\n\nRead more\n\nArchived post.

The server didn't run until I installed\nxvfb but it's on a minimal machine without a dedicated GPU (just the\nintegrated Intel HD Graphics 630).\n\nReply reply\n\nZ3R0gravitas\n\n\u2022 1 yr. ago\n\nI'm sure CK dedicated servers still need some kind of GPU for the world to\ngenerate terrain. To avoid being trapped in obsidian.\n\nA guide was written for setting up dedicated servers, here on the wikizet:\nhttps://corekeeper.wikizet.com/en/How_to_setup_a_dedicated_server\n\nBut it needs to have mention of this issue added.
