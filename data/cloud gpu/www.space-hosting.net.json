The storage space in the VPS is virtual and by\ndefault the VPSes have a one gbps shared port.\n\n##### Can I order additional IP addresses for my service?\n\nAdditional IP addresses can be ordered for any solution. If you are placing a\nnew order, you can add them during product setup.

Very fast internet and\nprompt delivery of a few dedicated servers. The servers delivered were more\nthan expected and highly recommend them to anyone needing a Server!\n\n### Jane Smith\n\n**June 16, 2022**\n\nI have had a great experience with SpaceHosting. I\u2019ve already had servers at\nContabo, Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, but never had a VPS with the same\nperformance and price as Space Hosting. A VPS on Azure with similar\nperformance would cost me at least 15x more.\n\n### John Doe\n\n**August 18, 2022**\n\nThe best hosting I ever tried. I bought VPS and never regretted it, antiddos\nis at the highest level, ping is perfect, internet speed is perfect,\neverything that is stated by the provider is provided at the highest level\n\n## Load Balancers & IDS\n\nAre you afraid that your servers could be hacked?

Very fast internet and\nprompt delivery of a few dedicated servers. The servers delivered were more\nthan expected and highly recommend them to anyone needing a Server!\n\n### Jane Smith\n\n**June 16, 2022**\n\nI have had a great experience with SpaceHosting. I\u2019ve already had servers at\nContabo, Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, but never had a VPS with the same\nperformance and price as Space Hosting. A VPS on Azure with similar\nperformance would cost me at least 15x more.\n\n### John Doe\n\n**August 18, 2022**\n\nThe best hosting I ever tried. I bought VPS and never regretted it, antiddos\nis at the highest level, ping is perfect, internet speed is perfect,\neverything that is stated by the provider is provided at the highest level\n\n## Load Balancers & IDS\n\nAre you afraid that your servers could be hacked?
