    "priceAndPlans": "# I didn\u2019t like the price so I built a SaaS company over a weekend. Here is\nwhat it took.\n\nJustin Hartung\n\n\u00b7\n\nFollow\n\n7 min read\n\n\u00b7\n\nDec 5, 2022\n\n4.2K\n\n71\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nUser traffic starting on \u201claunch day\u201d July 19th\n\nEvery once in a while you do something unexpected or out of character. Last\nsummer I created a company, initially out of spite, but it turned into an\nincredible learning experience and the realization that it is very easy to\nstart a company. Perhaps this may be helpful to others starting a similar\njourney.\n\nMany of us at Qarik are Xooglers, in fact we started Qarik to help companies\ndevelop more like Google. At Google, we used \u201cgo\u201d links to quickly share a URL\nin a memorable way. I.e. type in \u201cgo/hr\u201d to get to our HR portal. It\neffectively replaced an intranet for most use cases.\n\nNaturally we wanted the same at our new company. We found a tool that worked\nwell and wanted to purchase it, however, the cost was over $10 per user per\nmonth. To put this in context, we spend $18 per user per month for all of\nGoogle\u2019s communications and collaboration tools. It is also 2x the amount most\ncompanies spend on GitHub.\n\nI also, however, find value in paying others so we can focus on our core.\nWhile this tool will be helpful, it didn\u2019t make sense for us to spend over\n$12,000/year. As it turns out my core is building robust cloud based systems\u2026\n\nSo over the weekend last summer while watching my kiddos at a pool I built and\nlaunched a virtual SaaS company, Goto Tools. Since this was going to be a side\nproject, it needed to be built in a way that wouldn\u2019t require my time during\nnormal business hours and **because I am lazy** , it needed to be 100%\nautomated including tracking expenses and revenue and all accounting\nfunctions. Despite these design goals, I went from idea, to fully operational,\nincluding CICD with automated testing and self healing in 3 days. In all\nhonesty, it did take two more weeks for the official business license\nregistration, so 14 days but 3 days sounds way better.\n\nAlmost everything is 100% automated. A dirty secret is I don\u2019t charge any\ncustomers because it is very cheap and I haven\u2019t yet built robust billing\n(shh, please don\u2019t tell my customers). Perhaps I\u2019ll do that sometime next\nsummer. In the meantime, I can count some impressive customers from an AI\ncompany (105 employees) to a food delivery company (>3,000 employees) to a\nlarge FANG tech company (close to 1,000,000 employees), which I am shocked as\nthey must have their own \ud83e\udd14. Well, clearly there is a need, even if they\nalready have their own internal system that tries to meet the need. If I am\nbeing honest here, it probably started with an employee that did a Google\nsearch by mistake and ended up on my site rather than their internal system \ud83e\udd37.\n\nI have found many tools that make running a company incredibly easy and\naffordable. I spend a total of $79/month for all fixed costs. Everything on\ntop of this is variable and trackable directly to revenue if I decide to\nmonetize.\n\nIn case anybody else is looking at automating the back office of your company,\nhere is Goto Tools operational stack and monthly costs. If there is interest\nI\u2019ll be happy to share details about the integrations along with source\ncode/instructions.\n\n  1. Google Ads + Linked-in Ads ~ $100/month (variable, not fixed)\n  2. HubSpot for CRM, customer funnel tracking and conversion ~ $30/month\n  3. Stripe for billing ~$0/month (I\u2019ve decided not to monetize yet)\n  4. Quickbooks for accounting ~ $25/month\n  5. Mercury for banking ~ $0/month\n  6. Google Workspace for all communications, including voice calling ~ $18/month\n  7. Slack for automated communications (chat with us on website, deployment trigger, alerts, etc.) ~ $0/month\n  8. GitHub for source code hosting, CICD + IDE for quick changes ~ $0/month\n  9. Google Cloud for hosting ~$incredibly low /month\n  10. Google BigQuery for data warehouse ~$0/month (at current scale)\n  11. Google Looker Studio for reporting ~$0/month\n  12. Microsoft o365 to test SSO auth with MSFT ~$6/month\n\nStartup costs: ~$400\n\n  1. Domains (several for testing purposes): $30\n  2. Business license + processing fees: $350\n  3. A few verification fees to establish accounts like Google Developer to publish our Chrome extension to the Chrome webstore.\n\n **IT Systems**\n\nEverything is SaaS and Single Sign On linked to Google Workspace Account\nw/2FA. Google Voice for phone communications so it can ring my other phones\nand help screen spam phone calls. Hubspot also provides a voice number and has\nsome fancy sales call logging built-in that I\u2019ll explore later. Since\neverything is web based, I can do most of my development from a Chromebook and\nGitHub code spaces.\n\n **Source Code & CICD**\n\nI currently use a monorepo in GitHub with built in CI via GitHub Actions for\nevery aspect of the business from public facing website, core go link\napplication, to data sync and data warehouse schema management. This allows\ncross system changes such as updating pricing, fields, etc. with one commit. I\ncan do this on the go from my phone in a pinch. The CICD system alerts me on\nSlack of build and test results so I can approve the push to production. There\nare components of the software written in Python and NodeJS, but this setup\ncan easily accommodate any language if needed. I was tempted to learn Go or\nRust, but that would have probably taken me an extra few days.\n\n **Data Sync**\n\nTo get data from all the above systems into BigQuery, I built some simple\nCloud Functions that copy data from APIs and write to BigQuery. For systems\nthat support it I just accept a webhook feed of data changes as they happen.\nFor deduping, I do a full sync and than run a SQL query to materialize the\nonly the latest records:\n\n    \n    \n    execute_query(sql=f\"SELECT * FROM `{GCP_PROJECT}.{DATASET}.{source_table_id}` QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY {updated_by_field} DESC) = 1\",   \n                  destination_table_id=f\"{GCP_PROJECT}.{DATASET}.{destination_table_id}\")\n\nThis happens every 15 minutes. I expect this will start to experience scale\nissues when I get to over 50,000 customers in the CRM or 1,000,000 users of\nthe system due to in memory requirements. But good enough for now.\n\n **Advertising**\n\nI love LinkedIn\u2019s targeting ability. I can target employees that once worked\nfor Google than are now working at another engineering company with less than\n1,000 employees. Here is over a million views, just from October 22nd to\nNovember 11th.\n\nLinkedIn Advertising impressions from October 22nd to November 12th\n\n **Reporting**\n\nI can see every touchpoint through the funnel through purchase which is\nsigning up for the service. This triggers a drip campaign to nudge users to\ninvite and grow the account. All the data is pushed in real time (or batch\nsynced in 15m to BigQuery so I get near real time dashboards on all aspects of\nactivity and my core business metrics.\n\n **Accounting**\n\nAll receipts are automatically entered into Quickbooks and tracked to the\ncorrect GL codes, allowing continuous closing meaning I can see my exact P&L,\nbalance sheet, and any forecasted costs coming down the pipeline. Right now\nI\u2019m on a cash basis, and will likely switch to accrual if this turns into\nanything meaningful.\n\n **What is next?**\n\nI\u2019m tempted to create a \u201cvirtual sales staff\u201d essentially building a SaaS\nsoftware \u2014 very light CRM and sales tracking to allow others to become virtual\nsales staff and pay anybody that wants to sell my services 20% of first year\nrevenue and 5% of year two revenue. If they sell a customer with 10,000\nemployees, they would get a check for $20,000 for year one and $5,000 in year\ntwo. I think this would unlock a very interesting business model and allow\nmeaningful freelance revenue for some enterprising individuals. Please let me\nknow if you are interested!\n\nYou can read the full business plan and financial model, and I\u2019ll post later\nabout the software stack, which has built in geo pinning to handle enterprise\njurisdiction + global HA, but here is a sneak peek on how great Google is when\nyou embrace their ecosystem. I spend less than $500/month for sustained\nmultiple QPS (queries per second).\n\nEvery deployment is automatically monitored and analyzed including performance\nregressions:\n\nGoogle\u2019s latency report comparing the latency distribution of a new software\nversion.\n\nEffort: NOTHING!\n\nEvery request is traced, including interaction between microservices, and\nevent based architectures.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Trace report for RPC calls inside of application code.\n\nWhat did I need to do to code this? NOTHING.\n\nBuilt in SLA, SLO and SLIs with Error Budgets, Alerting and incident\nmanagement:\n\nGoogle\u2019s built-in SLO compliance dashboard.\n\nAnother view of Google\u2019s Latency SLO compliance dashboard.\n\nEffort/Cost: a few simple configurations.\n\nThis has been a fascinating side project that has allowed me to dive a little\ndeeper in advertising, funnel tracking and conversion optimization \u2014 something\nI think more engineers should learn about.\n\nIf you or your company needs or wants internal short links, I know a guy who\nhas a company that you should check out :)\n\n-Justin Hartung\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nSaaS\n\nSoftware Development\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform\n\nLinkedin Ads\n\nSome rights reserved\n\n4.2K\n\n4.2K\n\n71\n\nFollow\n\n## Written by Justin Hartung\n\n1.6K Followers\n\nLackluster husband and writer, but above average dad, engineer, and business\nguy.\n\nFollow\n\n## More from Justin Hartung\n\nJustin Hartung\n\n## I liked my Uber driver so much that I made him an app\n\n### Turning a simple Uber ride into a Customer Relationship Nurturing System\n\n5 min read\u00b7Sep 11\n\n120\n\nJustin Hartung\n\n## Goto Tools Business Plan and Roadmap\n\n### My SaaS business plan with ALL the confidential information: financial\nmodel, break even point, anticipated fixed and variable costs.\n\n\u00b78 min read\u00b7Jan 3\n\n334\n\n5\n\nJustin Hartung\n\n## I managed to outsource all authentication headaches in 1 hour for my SaaS\n\n### Authentication seems easy at first, but doing it correctly is hard, really\nhard.
