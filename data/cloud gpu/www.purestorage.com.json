Pure Knowledge __\n  2. What Is a Dedicated GPU Server? \n\n# What Is a Dedicated GPU Server?\n\nA dedicated GPU server is a server with one or more graphics processing units\n(GPUs) that offers increased power and speed for running computationally\nintensive tasks, such as video rendering, data analytics, and machine\nlearning. Dedicated GPU servers may also have a specialized CPU and come with\nlarge amounts of RAM and storage.\n\nThe parallel architecture of a GPU, originally designed to handle graphics and\nvideo processing, allows a dedicated GPU server to manage multiple tasks\nsimultaneously at speeds beyond the abilities of a CPU-based server.\n\n### What Is a GPU Rack Server?  \n\nA GPU rack server is a server equipped with GPUs designed to fit into a server\nrack. A server rack is a rectangular framework with multiple mounting slots\ndesigned to hold rack servers and other networking components. Servers are\nstacked on top of each other to minimize the use of floor space and are slid\nin and out of the rack as necessary.\n\nA GPU rack server offers several advantages, including better space\nutilization, increased scalability, maximized airflow, and easier maintenance.\n\n### Reasons to Use a Dedicated GPU Server  \n\nGPUs are the throughput-optimized, specialized, counterparts to CPUs. Instead\nof having a handful of heavyweight cores with high clock speeds capable of\nperforming a wide variety of computational tasks, GPUs employ thousands of\nlightweight cores optimized to process the same operation in parallel (i.e.,\nSingle Instruction, Multiple Data [SIMD]).\n\nThese cores have instruction sets optimized for dimensional matrix arithmetic\nand floating point calculations, speeding up linear algebra. The end result is\na system optimized for parallel computing.\n\nReasons you might want to use a dedicated GPU server include:\n\n  * Big data analytics pipelines\n  * Streaming video\n  * Image processing\n  * 3D animations and simulations (e.g., the modeling of protein chain folding)\n  * Deep learning applications (e.g., speech recognition)\n  * Hash cracking (e.g., password recovery)\n  * Mining cryptocurrency\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a single operation you need accelerated that can benefit from\nparallel execution across thousands of cores, a dedicated GPU server can help.  \n\n### Types of GPU Rack Servers\n\nGPU rack servers fit into rack servers or cabinets. Server racks and the\nequipment installed in them are measured in rack units, written as \u201cU\u201d or\nsometimes \u201cRU.\u201d A \u201cU\u201d describes the height of equipment (e.g., the height of a\nserver or the height and number of shelves in a server rack).\n\nOne U equals 1.75 inches, so the height of a 1U server would be 1.75 inches\nand a 2U server would be 3.5 inches. A 32U rack unit, for example, can hold 32\n1U servers, 4 8U servers, or 1 32U server.\n\nRead \u201cA Definitive Guide to 19-Inch Server Rack Sizes\u201d for more information\nabout rack sizing.\n\n#### Smaller Form Factors vs. Larger Form Factors\n\nThe primary differences between smaller and larger rack server form factors\nare their density and expandability.\n\n**1U & 2U GPU Rack Servers**\n\nSmaller form factors, such as 1U and 2U GPU rack servers, are designed with\nperformance density in mind but are less powerful than larger GPU server form\nfactors. They\u2019re commonly used because of their lower costs and ability to\nsave server rack space.\n\n1U and 2U GPU rack servers are easy to maintain, highly portable, and easy to\nscale (you can scale performance by using several of them). A 1U server can\ntypically hold a CPU or two, several terabytes of memory, and multiple GPUs. A\n2U server at double the height of the 1U server will give you a little extra\nspace for computing power and storage.\n\nIn smaller form factor servers, GPUs are typically mounted horizontally\nbecause of space restrictions. There\u2019s also less space for PCIe slots and\nstorage, though you can expand these using a PCIe expansion kit or JBOD\nenclosure.\n\n**8U & 16U GPU Rack Servers**\n\nLarger GPU rack servers such as 8U and 16U are geared toward workloads that\nrequire more extensive performance capabilities. They come with more room for\nstorage and additional expansion slots, enabling you to plug in additional\nPCIe cards to increase data processing performance. The additional space also\npromotes better air circulation to prevent overheating.\n\nIn a larger form factor, GPUs are installed vertically with extra room for\npower connections located at the top of the card rather than at the rear.\n\n### How to Size a Dedicated GPU Server\n\nWhen sizing a dedicated GPU server, you\u2019ll need to consider the product\nfeatures you want, as well as your current and future business needs. The\noptimal server configuration depends on your target workloads, the specific\nuse cases of that server, and how fast you need it to be.\n\nDedicated GPU servers can be configured for specific target workloads, such as\nvideo rendering, deep learning training, inference, big data analytics, and\nhigh-performance computing (HPC). The optimal server configuration depends on\nyour target workloads, the specific use cases of that server, and how fast you\nneed it to be.\n\nGPUs use a lot of power and generate tons of heat. They\u2019re larger than CPUs\nand need extra space for power connectors. The server chassis must not only be\nlarge enough to fit the amount of GPUs you want to use but also provide good\nair ventilation to prevent overheating and thermal throttling.\n\n### How Much Does a Dedicated GPU Server Cost?\n\nUnderstandably, costs will vary depending on whether you choose to build your\nown dedicated GPU server, rent a server, or use cloud-based services.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be building your own server, you\u2019ll need to consider the cost of the\nGPU as well as the power supply, chassis, specialized CPU, RAM, and storage.\nYou may also need to consider the costs that come with building on-premises\ndata centers, such as power, space, cooling, and maintenance costs.\n\nGPUs are classified on specializations, and prices vary depending on the use\ncase. For example, NVIDIA offers Tesla V100-based servers suitable for deep\nlearning and high-precision calculations. A top-rated GPU such as NVIDIA\u2019s\nNvidia GTX Titan Z can cost around $3,000.\n\nIf you choose to go with a cloud platform, there are several cloud service\nproviders that offer dedicated GPU-powered server plans including the major\ncloud service providers like AWS V2 Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure.\nAWS, for example, offers on-demand pricing starting at $0.900 per hour for one\nGPU and four virtual cores.\n\n### GPU Rack Server: Purchase vs. Rent\n\nChoosing whether to purchase or rent comes down to several factors. Your\ncompany\u2019s budget and potential use cases are the main ones.\n\nPurchasing a GPU rack server involves upfront costs. Top-rated GPUs for\nmachine learning workloads can come with a hefty price tag. Add this to the\nmaintenance, energy, and bandwidth costs of storing your GPU server on\npremises, and your initial investment costs could be astronomical.\n\nWith the pace of modern technological innovations, buying a GPU server comes\nwith the risk of it becoming obsolete before you can make a return on your\ninvestment. Updating the system will also incur additional costs.\n\nIf you work with large data sets and plan to deploy your models in a\nproduction environment, consider renting GPU infrastructure through a cloud\nservice provider. This subscription model allows you to pay by the hour or\nmonthly depending on the resources you use and scale up or down based on\ncurrent demands.\n\n### Get State-of-the-art AI Infrastructure with Pure Storage\n\nA dedicated GPU server offers several advantages over a CPU-based server,\nincluding higher performance, increased flexibility, and better utilization of\nCPU resources.
