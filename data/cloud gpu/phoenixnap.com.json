The ability to leverage AI for predictions, classifications and\nanalytics make a significant difference for any business with access to large,\ncomplex and ever-growing data sources. Deep Learning training and inference is\nat the core of delivering such AI services. As Neural Networks become deeper\nand more complex they require more parallel-processing power, more memory\nbandwidth, and faster networks. These requirements are necessary to achieve\nreasonable training times along with fast-processing for inference of\nproduction workload deployments.\n\n### High-Performance Computing (HPC) / Big Data\n\nSolving complex computational problems in a short amount of time, as well as\ndealing with large-size data sets and extreme amounts of continuously growing\ndata, are challenges that are being tackled by parallel processing algorithms.\nData center deployments with high-end NVIDIA Tesla GPUs enable computational,\nstorage and network processing power to support such highly demanding\nworkloads. Access to thousands of cores from each GPU with high-capacity\nnetwork and high-IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) storage allows for\nideal infrastructure builds for HPC and Big Data application deployments\nalike.\n\n### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) / Streaming / Rendering\n\nUse cases that utilize a GPUs tremendous power and parallel processing include\nheavy rendering tasks, image manipulation, streaming for video and inference\npurposes, and the ability to provide secure, scalable anywhere/anytime access\nto applications, to name a few. These types of cloud deployments utilizing a\nGPU, combined with reliable network and fast NVMe/SSD storage, are able to\nprovide economical, high-performance and agile solutions for companies that\nare looking to leverage the latest technologies to achieve its business\nobjectives.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\n\n### More Human Than Human.\n\nDeep Learning has become a true enabler of AI services; in fact, it is the key\ndriver behind today\u2019s entire field of AI and its real-life practical\napplications. Machine Learning business utilization and its ability to support\nbusiness objectives have enabled AI services to take a seat at the company\nstrategic table. From life and health sciences, through engineering and\nfinancial modeling, to natural language processing and image recognition, the\nemployment of Deep Learning is growing exponentially each year.
