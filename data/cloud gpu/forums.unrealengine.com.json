Hopefully someone can jump\nin. Do dedicated servers utilize the GPU?\n\nanonymous_user_0df12f74 (anonymous_user_0df12f74)  July 30, 2016, 7:09pm  3\n\nHi there,\n\nThe dedicated server doesn\u2019t do any rendering of the game. Instead it handles\nthe game logic on the CPU, therefore it is not necessary to add a high end\nGPU. You could probably get away with the Intel HD graphics GPU that is built\ninto most of their consumer CPU\u2019s so long as your game doesn\u2019t perform any of\nit\u2019s logic on the GPU (this would need to be custom coded, most if not all\ngames currently do not, UE4 will not by default) PhysX is run on the CPU in\nUE4.\n\nIf you plan to use the machine for anything other than a server, then it\u2019s up\nto you. Obtaining a better CPU with the money you save will go much further\nthan a GPU as far as performance per dollar goes. A high end i7 or Xeon\nprocessor(s) would work the best, the more cores available the better.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nZhi_Kang_Shao (Zhi Kang Shao)  August 1, 2016, 7:58pm  4\n\nThanks for your info, especially that PhysX is run on the CPU in UE4. In our\ncase we\u2019re considering whether for dedicated game servers hosted on Amazon Web\nServices we need a virtual server with graphics capabilities or not. From your\ninformation I assume we don\u2019t, that\u2019s good enough for now!\n\n  * Home \n  * Categories \n  * FAQ/Guidelines \n  * Terms of Service \n  * Privacy Policy \n\nPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\n\nSkip to main content\n\n  * Create\n\nBack\n\n### Ready to start making things?\n\nEpic has the tools and resources to help you create everything from a lifelike\nMetahuman to a thrilling Fortnite Creative experience, you could even an\nentire game of your own in the Unreal Engine.\n\n    * Fortnite Creative\n    * Unreal Engine\n    * Twinmotion\n    * RealityCapture\n    * Sketchfab\n    * MetaHuman\n    * Megascans\n\n  * Operate\n\nBack\n\n### Ready to share your work with the world?\n\nEpic provides a wide variety of tools and services to help you do just that,\nfrom backend game and account services to publishing on the Epic Games Store.\n\n    * Game Services\n    * Account Services\n    * Kids Web Services\n    * RealityCapture\n    * Epic Games Store\n    * Releasing Your Unreal Engine Game\n\n  * Community\n\nBack\n\n### The Epic developer community is large, friendly and diverse.\n\nMeet up with fellow developers in your area, watch your peers show off their\nskills on Inside Unreal or reach out to our Indies team to see what Epic can\ndo for you!\n\n    * Community Heroes\n    * Unreal Indies\n    * Meetups\n    * Inside Unreal\n    * Unreal Challenges\n\n  * Documentation\n\nBack\n\n### Know what you want to do, but not how?\n\nDig into our wide range of documentation, learning material and tutorials to\nfind your footing!\n\n    * Unreal Engine\n    * Epic Online Services\n    * RealityCapture\n    * Twinmotion\n    * Fortnite Creative\n\n  * Get Started\n\nBack\n\n### Time to get rolling!\n\nGrab some tools and marketplace content from the Epic Games Launcher or head\nover to the Dev Portal to find the tutorials and guidance you need\n\n    * Epic Games Launcher\n    * Dev Portal\n\n  * unreal engine Forum \n  * Platform & Builds\n  * Debugging, Optimization, & Profiling\n\nSign In\n\n  *   * \n\nunreal engine  \n484,499\n\nUEFN & Creative  \n8,526\n\nepic games store  \n287\n\ncapturing reality  \n1,944\n\nMetaHuman  \n1,471\n\nTwinmotion  \n491\n\nAll outgoing email has been globally disabled by an administrator.

The goal is to\ncreate trade routes that actually makes sense.\n\nExample:  \nThe \u201cbasic\u201d price of Stone is 30. When a city has a lot of stone it costs 20.\nWhen a city has barely any stone it costs 50. This number should change based\non quantity and never exceed the max or min. value.\n\nIn addition to this (but its \u2018optional\u2019, items has different sensivity to\nquantity changes.  \nExample:  \nStandard amount of grain in a city is 5,000. When the city has 8,000 the price\nchanges by a notable but not extreme number, because a stockpile of wheat is\ngood.  \nStandard amount of stone in a city is 500. When the city has 800 the price\nchanges by a lot, because it\u2019s city main income and the stockpile is almost\nfull.\n\nBut the most important for me is functional example #1.  \nHelp?\n\nSolved by Chatouille in post #2\n\n> Most simplistic functional example #1 [image] [aaaaaa]\n\n  * #### created\n\nOct '22\n\n  * #### last reply\n\nOct '22\n\n  * 2\n\n#### replies\n\n  * 173\n\n#### views\n\n  * 2\n\n#### users\n\n  * 4\n\n#### likes\n\n  * 2\n\nChatouille\n\n1\n\nOct '22\n\nMost simplistic functional example #1\n\nimage890\u00d7546 102 KB\n\nSolution\n\n3\n\nSiegriel\n\nOct '22\n\nOmg big thank you!
