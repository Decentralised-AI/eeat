To safeguard the health of our scientists, ATCC has adopted a battery\nof best practices that minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with little impact\non productivity. Whether returning after a hiatus or gearing up for a new\nproject, we can all use a refresher to help follow best practices. Please read\nthis first section of the culture guide for some quick reminders about common\ncontamination hotspots and advice on how to keep them in check while getting\nyour work done.\n\n#### Materials, contamination, and workspace\n\nYou may be just getting back into the laboratory or beginning a new project.\nBefore you start, consider some potential hotspots that can profoundly affect\nyour experimental results, such as the quality of your starting materials,\nexecution of proper laboratory technique, and organization of your workspace.\nHere are some simple tips and techniques to avoid ruining your experiments,\nleading to confounding results, paper retractions, financial loss, and damaged\nreputation.\n\n**Material for research**\n\n  1. Check existing materials for signs of contamination. \n  2. Authenticate and replenish your cell lines and microbes. \n  3. Start new projects with trustworthy materials. \n  4. Routinely check the expiration dates of media and reagents. \n\n**Cross contamination**\n\n  1. Ensure everyone\u2014new and experienced\u2014is trained on aseptic techniques. \n  2. Aliquot your samples and reagents. \n  3. When aliquoting is impractical, put just the amount of the reagent you expect to use into a secondary container. Discard the remainder when finished working. \n  4. Avoid sharing pipettes or other equipment. \n  5. Clean the insides and exteriors of pipettes and tools that must be shared. \n  6. Utilize the biosafety cabinet to reduce contamination. \n\n**Personal space and equipment**\n\n  1. Keep bench space uncluttered. \n  2. Wash your lab coat regularly. \n  3. Leave personal items outside. \n  4. Clean your work area before and after use. \n  5. Use lab tablets instead of personal phones. \n  6. If personal items are needed, sanitize them before and after lab use. \n  7. Move extra equipment away from walls and crevices to facilitate frequent and thorough cleaning. \n\n#### Avoiding infection\n\nLike you, we\u2019re committed to protecting the health of our colleagues. While\nSARS-CoV-2 is currently unique in its pathogenic nature and transmission\ndynamics, other infectious organisms may in time arise to threaten the health\nof laboratory workers. To reduce the chance of contracting a current or\nemerging infectious disease while working in the lab under epidemic or\npandemic conditions, we recommend you follow these best practices.\n\n**Coming and going**\n\n  1. Wash your hands well when entering and leaving the lab. \n  2. Master the basics of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use and removal. \n  3. Stay home if you\u2019ve been exposed to any illness. \n  4. Inspect PPE prior to use.\n\n**Interacting with others**\n\n  1. Remember, particles spread via talking, coughing, and breathing. \n  2. Use virtual collaboration tools, and only converse before or after working on cell cultures. \n  3. Always keep your nose, mouth, and skin covered with PPE. \n  4. Be extra vigilant about PPE use when working with animals. \n  5. Keep 6 feet of space between individuals. \n\n**Airborne transmission**\n\n  1. Reduce foot traffic in the lab. \n  2. Designate one-way traffic flows to support distancing. \n  3. Try limiting capacity to aid physical distancing. \n\n### Getting started with an ATCC cell line\n\nATCC cell lines and hybridomas are shipped frozen on dry ice in\ncryopreservation vials or as growing cultures in flasks at ambient\ntemperature. Upon receipt of frozen cells, it is important to immediately\nrevive them by thawing and removing the DMSO and placing them into culture. If\nthis is not possible, store the cells in liquid nitrogen vapor (below \u2212130\u00b0C).\nDo not store frozen cells at temperatures above \u2212130\u00b0C as their viability will\ndecline rapidly.\n\n#### Product sheet\n\nATCC cell line Product Sheets that contains detailed information for handling\nthe cells may be found at the ATCC website or contact ATCC Technical Support\nto request a copy. The Product Sheet also contains batch-specific information\nsuch as the number of cells per vial, the recommended split or subcultivation\nratio, and the passage number when known.\n\n#### Preparation of medium\n\nPrepare for reviving cell lines by assembling the appropriate medium, serum,\nand additional reagents required for growth. Many of these products are\navailable from ATCC and can be ordered with the cell lines. These are the same\nreagents used by ATCC for cell growth and preservation. (See: NOTE 1)\n\n**NOTE 1  \n**While most cell lines can replicate in more than one culture medium, their\ncharacteristics may alter when the medium is changed. For this reason,\nstarting cell cultures in the same medium used by ATCC is recommended for the\nbest results (see the Product Information Sheet and ATCC website). For details\non adapting a cell line to a new medium, see Adapting to a new medium or\nserum.\n\n#### Initiating frozen cultures\n\n  1. Prepare a culture vessel so that it contains the recommended volume of the appropriate culture medium as listed on the Product Sheet, equilibrated for temperature and pH (CO2).\n  2. Thaw the vial by gentle agitation in a water bath at 37\u00b0C or the normal growth temperature for that cell line. Thawing should be rapid, approximately 2 minutes or until ice crystals have melted. \n  3. Remove the vial from the water bath and decontaminate it by dipping in or spraying with 70% ethanol. Follow strict aseptic conditions in a laminar flow tissue culture hood for all further manipulations. \n  4. Unscrew the top of the vial and transfer the contents to a sterile centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of the recommended medium. Remove the cryoprotectant agent (DMSO) by gentle centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g). Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 or 2 mL of complete growth medium. Transfer the cell suspension into the culture vessel containing the complete growth medium and mix thoroughly by gentle rocking. \n  5. Examine the cell cultures after 24 hours and subculture as needed. (See: NOTE 2) \n\n**NOTE 2  \n**Some cell lines, such as hybridomas, take several days before fully\nrecovering from cryopreservation. Some hybridomas have poor viability the\nfirst day in culture and will generate cellular debris. After this point, the\ncells will begin to recover and enter exponential growth.\n\n#### Processing flask cultures\n\nSome ATCC cell, are shipped as growing cultures in culture vessels. These\nvessels are seeded with cells, incubated to ensure cell growth and then filled\ncompletely with medium for shipping.\n\nUpon receiving a flask culture, visually examine the medium for macroscopic\nevidence of microbial contamination. This includes unusual pH shifts (yellow\nor purple color from the phenol red), turbidity, or particles. With an\ninverted microscope at low power (100\u00d7) check the medium for evidence of\nmicrobial contamination as well as the morphology of the cells. See more\ndetails on examining cell cultures.\n\n**If the cells are attached and growing in a monolayer:**\n\n  1. Aseptically remove all but 5 mL to 10 mL of the shipping medium. The shipping medium can be saved for reuse and should be stored at 4\u00b0C. \n  2. Incubate the flask at the temperature and CO2 concentration recommended on the Product Sheet (37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for most cell lines) until the cells are subcultured. \n\n**If the cells are not attached or are growing in suspension:**\n\n  1. Aseptically transfer the entire contents of the flask to a centrifuge tube. \n  2. Centrifuge at 125 \u00d7 g for 5 to 10 minutes. \n  3. Remove all but 10 mL of the shipping medium supernatant and resuspend the cells. Store the remainder of this medium at 4\u00b0C for later use. \n  4. Aseptically transfer the resuspended cells to a 25-cm2 flask or 75-cm2 flask, depending upon the cell line (see the Product Sheet). \n  5. Incubate the cells at the temperature and CO2 concentration recommended on the Product Information Sheet until cells are subcultured. \n\nMost cell lines begin as primary cultures originating from a piece of minced\nor enzyme-dispersed tissue. Primary cultures, as mixtures of several cell\ntypes, retain the characteristics of their source tissue.\n\nAfter a period of time, primary cultures will reach confluency, the state when\nall available space of the culture vessel is covered due to cellular\nexpansion. At this point, the culture will need to be disaggregated (usually\nwith proteolytic enzymes like trypsin) into individual cells and subcultured\n(split, passaged, or transferred). Following this first passage, the culture\nis generally referred to as a cell line. With each subsequent subculture, the\ncellular population becomes more homogeneous as the faster growing cells\npredominate. Cells with desired properties can also be selected out of the\nculture by cloning.\n\nDiploid cell lines rarely progress beyond a few population doublings. They\nhave a finite replicative capacity and begin to slow down and eventually stop\ndividing after 20 to 80 population doublings.1 Recent evidence suggests that\nsome of the observed cellular senescence in cell culture may be due to\ninappropriate culture conditions as opposed to a predetermined replicative\nsenescence.2 Still other data support replicative senescence for the cells of\nsome species (notably human) even when grown in improved culture conditions.\nThis senescence is mediated by the shortening of the ends of the chromosomes\n(telomeres) with each cell division.3\n\nIn contrast, continuous (or immortalized) cell lines have infinite replicative\ncapacity. These lines are derived from cell lines through immortalization or\ntransformation by any one of a number of means. Many continuous cell lines\nwere derived from tumor tissue. Most of the cell lines in the ATCC collection\nare continuous, though a few, such as CCD-1117Sk human skin fibroblast (ATCC\nCRL-2465) or CCD-18Co human colon (ATCC CRL-1459) are finite.\n\nAs noted in the section on culture vessels, cell lines grow either attached to\na surface (anchorage dependent) or in suspension (anchorage independent). As\ncells grow and divide in a monolayer or in suspension, they usually follow a\ncharacteristic growth pattern composed of four phases: Lag, log or\nexponential, stationary or plateau and decline.\n\n  * Lag phase \u2014 Immediately after seeding of the culture vessel, the cells grow slowly while recovering from the stress of subculturing. \n  * Log or exponential phase \u2014 The cells enter a period of exponential growth that lasts until the entire growth surface is occupied or the cell concentration exceeds the capacity of the medium. \n  * Stationary phase \u2014 Cell proliferation slows and stops. \n  * Decline phase \u2014 If the culture medium is not replaced and the cell number is not reduced, the cells lose viability and their number decreases. \n\nTo ensure viability, genetic stability, and phenotypic stability, cell lines\nneed to be maintained in the exponential phase. This means that they need to\nbe subcultured on a regular basis before they enter the stationary growth\nphase, before a monolayer becomes 100% confluent or before a suspension\nreaches its maximum recommended cell density. Generating a growth curve for\neach cell line is useful to determine the growth characteristics of the cell\nline. (See: Figure 1)\n\nFor detailed information on the growth and propagation of any ATCC cell line,\nsee the specific cell line Product Sheet which can be found on the ATCC\nwebsite, or contact ATCC Technical Support to have one sent to you.\n\n### Cell growth and propagation\n\n#### Passage number and population doubling level\n\nPrimary cultures are generally subcultured at a 1:2 ratio (they are split in\nhalf with each passage). Most continuous cell lines replicate at higher rates\nand are subcultured at a much higher split ratio. Passage number is generally\nthe number of times the cells have been subcultured into a new vessel. For\ndiploid cultures, passage number is roughly equal to the number of population\ndoublings (or population doubling level, PDL) since the culture was started.\nThis is not the case for continuous cell lines as they are passaged at higher\nsplit ratios. Consequently the PDL is not determined for continuous cell\nlines. In most cases, the PDL is an estimate as it does not account for any\ncells that were lost due to death from necrosis or apoptosis or cells which\nare nearing senescence and no longer divide. Calculate the population doubling\nlevel with the following formula:\n\nPDL = 3.32 (log Xe \u2013 log Xb) + S\n\nXb is the cell number at the beginning of the incubation time.  \nXe is the cell number at the end of the incubation time.  \nS is the starting PDL.\n\n**Figure 1: Growth curve for cells grown in culture.** Cells should be\nsubcultured while still in the exponential phase.\n\nCalculate the population doubling time, or the time required for a culture to\ndouble in number, with the following formula:\n\nDT=T ln2/ln(Xe/Xb)\n\nT is the incubation time in any units.  \nXb is the cell number at the beginning of the incubation time.  \nXe is the cell number at the end of the incubation time. (See: NOTE 3)\n\nATCC tracks the PDL and passage number for many adherent cell lines when the\ndepositor supplies this information at the time of deposit. See the Product\nInformation Sheet for the specific cell line for the passage number and/or PDL\nas part of the batch-specific information supplied.\n\n**NOTE 3**  \nCells grow at different rates in each of the different phases of the growth\ncycle and the calculated doubling time may be a composite of growth during\nmore than one of these phases. Growth during exponential growth or log phase\nis fairly constant and reproducible for a given set of growth conditions.\n\n#### Adapting to a new medium or serum\n\nTo ensure that the characteristics of your cell line remain constant, maintain\nyour cells in the same medium, serum, and supplements with the same\nsubculturing regimen used to establish the culture. Any change to the\nculturing conditions has the potential to change the characteristics of the\ncell line.\n\nBe particularly cautious when working with a new cell line as media\nformulations vary among suppliers, even for media with similar or identical\nnames. Read descriptions, formulations, and labels carefully to ensure that\nthe appropriate medium is used or the cell line may be inadvertently adapted\nto a new medium. All ATCC cell lines come with information on their growth\nmedium. In most cases, the recommended medium and serum can be purchased from\nATCC along with the cell line.\n\nUse the following procedure to adapt a cell line to a new medium:\n\n  1. Subculture the line at a 1:2 split ratio (split the culture in half) into two vessels. \n  2. Maintain one with the original medium and continue to subculture these cells for the entire adaptation process. Use a 1:1 mix of the original and new medium in the second vessel. The culture grown in the original medium serves as a reference point as well as a safeguard in case the adapting cells do not survive the process. The low split ratio helps mitigate the stress associated with subculturing as well as with the new medium. \n  3. Monitor cell growth in the two media and watch for any change in morphology or growth rate. If they are identical, subculture the adapting cells at the next passage with a 1:2 split ratio in a 1:3 medium mix (25% original, 75% new). \n  4. Monitor the growth rate and morphology of the original and adapting cultures. \n  5. At the next passage, split the adapting cultures 1:2 in a 1:7 medium mix (12.5% original, 87.5% new). \n  6. Monitor the growth rate and morphology of the original and adapting cultures. If the cells are identical, then at the next passage split the adapting cells 1:2 in 100% new medium. At this point, the culture should be adapted to the new medium. \n\nTo confirm complete adaptation to the new medium, perform functional tests on\ncells derived from the original and new medium. If at any point in the process\nthe adapting culture fails to perform as well as the reference culture, then\nallow the adapting culture more time and a few more passages in their current\nmedium mix (eg, 1:3, 1:7, etc.) until they match the reference cells.\n\nThe same approach can be used to adapt cells to serum-free medium; simply\ndecrease the serum level in the medium by half with each passage until a 0.06%\n(or lower) serum level is reached. At this point, the cells can be maintained\nin serum-free medium. If at any point the growth rate declines, then the serum\nlevel should be increased to the level where the cells grew normally. In this\nprocedure, start with the \u201cserum-free\u201d medium supplemented with serum so that\nonly the level of serum changes with each passage.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nMost animal cell lines require 37\u00b0C for optimum growth. Insect and amphibian\ncells require lower temperatures (such as 28\u00b0C) as do some animal cell lines\nwhich are temperature sensitive for their phenotypic characteristics. While\ncultured cells can withstand considerable drops in temperature and most can\nsurvive for several days at 4\u00b0C, few can tolerate even a few hours at more\nthan 2\u00b0C above their optimal temperature. (See: NOTE 4)\n\n**NOTE 4**  \nRegularly calibrate the temperature control system of incubators and use an\nalarm system when possible to warn against temperature increases above the\noptimum setting.\n\n#### Examination of cultures\n\nObserve the morphology and viability of cultures regularly and carefully.\nExamine the medium in the vessel for macroscopic evidence of microbial\ncontamination. This includes unusual pH shifts (yellow or purple color from\nthe phenol red), turbidity, or particles. Also, look for small fungal colonies\nthat float at the medium-air interface. Specifically check around the edges of\nthe vessel as these may not be readily visible through the microscope.\n\nWith an inverted microscope at low power (40\u00d7), check the medium for evidence\nof microbial contamination and the morphology of the cells. Bacterial\ncontamination will appear as small, shimmering black dots within the spaces\nbetween the cells. Yeast contamination will appear as rounded or budding\nparticles, while fungi will have thin filamentous mycelia. For nonadherent\ncells grown in flasks, such as hybridomas, this is a simple matter of viewing\nthe flask directly on the microscope. For cells grown in spinner flasks or\nbioreactors, a sample of the cell suspension will need to be withdrawn and\nloaded into a microscope slide or hemocytometer for observation.\n\nMost adherent cells should be attached firmly to the surface. In some cases,\nhealthy cells will round up and detach somewhat during mitosis and appear very\nrefractile. Following mitosis, they will reattach. Some of these will float\nfree if the culture vessel is physically disturbed. In contrast, dead cells\noften round up and detach from the monolayer and appear smaller and darker\n(not refractile) than healthy cells.\n\nCells in suspension culture grow either as single cells or as clusters of\ncells. Viable cells appear round and refractile whereas dead cells appear\nsmaller and darker. Occasionally, a portion of the cells will attach and grow\non the side of the culture vessel and appear round or flattened. The\npercentage of attached cells varies with the culture conditions and the cell\ndensity. Cellular debris may also be observed in healthy cell populations.\nSome cell lines grow as mixed adherent and suspension cultures.\n\nAs a reference, photomicrographs for some ATCC cell lines are available on the\nwebsite. Cells are shown at two different densities: just after subculturing\n(low) and just before they need to be subcultured (high).\n\nIn addition to daily examinations, periodically test a sample of the culture\nfor the presence of fungi, bacteria, and mycoplasma. There are several methods\nthat can be used to check for these contaminants. For additional information,\nrefer to the section on microbial contamination.\n\n#### Cell counting\n\nCell counts are necessary in order to establish or monitor growth rates as\nwell as to set up new cultures with known cell numbers. Hemocytometers (also\nspelled hemacytometers) are commonly used to estimate cell number and\ndetermine cell viability. A hemocytometer is a fairly thick glass slide with\ntwo counting chambers, one on each side. Each counting chamber has a mirrored\nsurface with a 3 \u00d7 3 mm grid of 9 counting squares. (See Figure 2.) The\nchambers have raised sides that will hold a coverslip exactly 0.1 mm above the\nchamber floor. Each of the 9 counting squares holds a volume of 0.0001 mL.\n\nHemocytometers are excellent for determining cell viability, but are not\nprecise for determining cell number due to the relatively low number of cells\nactually counted. An automated counter will generate the most reliable data,\nparticularly when used in combination with the viability data from a\nhemocytometer.\n\n**Count cells as follows:**\n\n  1. Clean, thoroughly dry, and assemble the hemocytometer with the cover slip. \n  2. Transfer a small amount of cell suspension to the edge of each of the two counting chambers. Allow the cell suspension to be drawn into the counting chamber by capillary action. \n  3. Place the hemocytometer under an inverted microscope and view the cells at 100\u00d7 magnification. \n  4. Focus on the quadrants, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 2. \n  5. Record the number of cells in each section. Average the number of cells, and multiply by the dilution factor. If the cells have not been diluted, this factor will be 104 cells/mL. Any dilution of the sample after it was removed from the cell suspension, such as using vital stain, needs to be included in the calculation. \n\nFor example, if the four counts are 60, 66, 69, and 75, the concentration\nwould be 68 \u00d7 104 cells/mL for the sample that was loaded into the\nhemocytometer. For best results, adjust the concentration of the suspension so\nthat 50 to 100 cells are in each of the four sections.\n\nMost cultures will grow at an initial inoculum cell concentration ranging from\n103 to 104 cells/cm2. Faster-growing cultures are usually set up at lower\nconcentrations. Some cultures do not grow well unless a minimum concentration\nof cells is initially added; see the Product Sheet for details.\n\n**Figure 2: Hemocytometer grid with Neubauer ruling.**\n\n#### Cell viability\n\nViability assays measure the number of viable cells in a population. When\ncombined with the total number of cells, the number of viable cells provides\nan accurate indication of the health of the cell culture. The most common and\nrapid methods rely upon the integrity of the cell membrane as an indicator of\ncell viability. Both trypan blue and erythrosin B stains are actively excluded\nby viable cells but are taken up and retained by dead cells, which lack an\nintact membrane.\n\nWhile both stains are used in the same way, ATCC recommends erythrosin B in\nplace of trypan blue for hematopoetic cells. When using trypan blue, incubate\ncells for two to five minutes prior to use. If not counted within this time,\nthe cells will begin to deteriorate and take up the dye. Erythrosin B does not\nrequire an incubation period.\n\nErythrosin B stain generates more accurate results with fewer false negatives\nand false positives. Erythrosin B stain solution provides a clear background\nand does not bind serum proteins as avidly as trypan blue, making stained\ncells more distinct and easier to identify. Also, microbial contamination or\nprecipitates in the cell culture are more readily apparent. Finally, trypan\nblue is toxic and a potential carcinogen.\n\n**For either stain use the following directions:**\n\n  1. Mix the cell suspension 1:1 with a 0.1% erythrosin B solution in PBS or 0.4% trypan blue solution in PBS. \n  2. Load the cells in the erythrosin B solution directly into a clean, dry hemocytometer, but incubate the trypan blue solution for two to five minutes before loading. \n  3. Nonviable cells will be stained red (erythrosin B) or dark blue (trypan blue). Cell viability is calculated as the number of unstained or viable cells divided by the total number of cells and expressed as a percentage. \n\n#### Subculturing monolayer cells\n\nAnchorage-dependent cell lines growing in monolayers need to be subcultured at\nregular intervals to maintain them in exponential growth. When the cells are\nnear the end of exponential growth (roughly 70% to 90% confluent), they are\nready to be subcultured. The subculturing procedure, including recommended\nsplit-ratios and medium replenishment (feeding) schedules, for each ATCC cell\nline is provided on the Product Information Sheet.\n\nSubcultivation of monolayers involves the breakage of both intercellular and\nintracellular cell-to-surface bonds. For some cells that are loosely attached,\na sharp blow with the palm of your hand against the side of the flask can\ndislodge them. Many require the digestion of their protein attachment bonds\nwith proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin/EDTA. For some cell lines mechanical\nforces such as scraping to dislodge the cells is preferred. After the cells\nhave been dissociated and dispersed into a single-cell suspension, they are\ndiluted to the appropriate concentration and transferred into fresh culture\nvessels with the appropriate growth medium where they will reattach, grow and\ndivide.\n\nThe procedure below is appropriate for most adherent cell lines. However,\nsince every cell line is unique, incubation times and temperature, number of\nwashes or the solution formulations may vary. In all cases, continually\nobserve the cells with a microscope during the dissociation process to prevent\ndamage by the dissociation solution. The amounts used in this procedure are\nfor a 75-cm2 flask. Adjust volumes as appropriate for different sized vessels.\n\n#### Monolayer subculturing\n\n  1. Bring the trypsin-EDTA solution (ATCC 30-2101), balanced salt solution [Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate Buffered Saline without calcium or magnesium, ATCC 30-2200], and complete growth medium to the appropriate temperature for the cell line. In most cases, this is the temperature used to grow the cells (usually 37\u00b0C). For some sensitive cells, the trypsin-EDTA solution may need to be used at room temperature or 4\u00b0C. \n  2. Remove and discard the cell culture medium from the flask. \n  3. Rinse the cell monolayer with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS without calcium or magnesium and remove. \n  4. Add 2 mL to 3 mL of the trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at the appropriate temperature. Check the progress of cell dissociation by microscopy. To avoid clumping, do not agitate the cells by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for them to detach. \n  5. Once the cells appear to be detached (5 to 15 minutes for most cell lines; they will appear rounded and refractile under the microscope), add 6 to 8 mL of complete growth medium with a pipette to the cell suspension to inactivate the trypsin. Gently wash any remaining cells from the growth surface of the flask. Check the cells with the microscope to be sure that most (>95%) are single cells. If cell clusters are apparent, continue to disperse the cells with gentle pipetting. (See: NOTE 5)\n  6. Add 12 mL to 15 mL of fresh culture medium to a new flask and equilibrate this medium to the appropriate pH and temperature. \n  7. Count the cells in suspension and determine their viability or simply divide them according to a routine split ratio and dispense them into the medium of the newly prepared flask. Do not add a concentrated cell suspension to an empty culture vessel as this can result in uneven cell attachment and growth. \n  8. Place the flask back into the incubator. Examine the culture the following day to ensure the cells have reattached and are actively growing. Change the medium as needed; for most actively growing cultures two to three times per week is typical. \n\n**NOTE 5**  \nFor serum-free or low-serum medium, remove the trypsin-EDTA solution by gentle\ncentrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g) and then resuspend the cells in 6 mL to\n8 mL of fresh medium. In some cases, the trypsin will need to be inactivated\nwith a trypsin inhibitor.\n\n#### Troubleshooting monolayer cell subculturing\n\n**Cells are difficult to remove.**\n\n  * Inhibitors in the medium (such as serum) have inactivated the dissociating agents. Rinse the cell monolayer twice with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS without calcium or magnesium before adding the dissociating solution. Or use the trypsin-EDTA solution in place of the Dulbecco\u2019s PBS for the first rinse of the monolayer. \n  * The dissociating solution was too weak. Use higher enzyme concentrations, higher EDTA concentrations, or different and/or additional enzymes (eg, dispase, collagenase). Or incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C to increase the activity of the dissociating solution. \n  * The cells have been confluent for too long and the cell-to-cell junctions are so tight they prevented the dissociation agents from reaching the substrate-cell interface. In the future, subculture the cells before they become confluent. \n\n**Cells form clumps after dissociation.**\n\n  * The dissociation procedure was too harsh and genomic DNA was released from lysed cells. Either the pipetting was too vigorous or the dissociating solution was too strong or too toxic (ie, the pH or osmolality of the buffer was incorrect). Add a drop of sterile DNAse (1 mg/mL in water) to the cell suspension to break down the DNA strands. In the future, treat the cells more gently during pipetting, shorten the incubation period, use a weaker dissociation solution (lower the enzyme concentration or remove the EDTA), or incubate at a lower temperature. \n  * The cells aggregated before dilution and dispersion into the medium. Hold the cell suspension on ice if there will be a delay between removing the cells from the flask growth surface and seeding a new flask. \n  * The cells were centrifuged too hard or too long when removing excess dissociation solution. Be sure to use gentle centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g).\n\n**Cells have difficulty reattaching to the flask.**\n\n  * The dissociation procedure was too long and stripped away necessary attachment proteins from the cell membrane. \n  * Insufficient serum or attachment factors were present in the medium (common with serum-free medium). Add attachment factors to the medium and/or use a protein-coated flask (collagen, poly-L-lysine, fibronectin, gelatin, etc.). \n  * The dissociating solution was not inactivated or removed by centrifugation. Add additional serum or specific enzyme inhibitors (eg, soybean trypsin inhibitor) to the neutralizing medium or centrifuge (5 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g) the cells down from the dissociation solution and resuspend in fresh medium. \n\n**Viability is lower than expected.**\n\n  * The dissociating procedure was too harsh. \n  * The pH or osmolality of the balanced salt solution containing the dissociation agents is incorrect. Check these directly and/or use a fresh bottle. \n  * The dispersed cell suspension was left too long at too high a cell concentration prior to reseeding. Keep the cells on ice. \n  * The medium was faulty. Use the recommended formulation and make sure it contains all of the required additives. \n\n#### Suspension cells\n\nMost primary cultures, finite cell lines, and continuous cell lines are\nanchorage dependent and thus grow in monolayers attached to a surface. Other\ncells, particularly those derived from hematopoietic or certain tumor tissues,\nare anchorage independent and grow in suspension.\n\nCell propagation in suspension has several advantages over propagation in\nmonolayer. Subculturing is a simple matter of dilution. There is little or no\ngrowth lag after splitting a suspension culture as there is with a monolayer\nculture, because there is none of the trauma associated with proteolytic\nenzyme dispersal. Suspension cultures require less lab space per cell yield,\nand scale-up is straightforward. Cells can be propagated in bioreactors\nsimilar to the fermentors used for yeast or bacteria cultures.\n\nDepending upon the cell type, suspension cultures are seeded at densities from\n2 \u00d7 104 to 5 \u00d7 105 viable cells/mL and can attain densities of 2 \u00d7 106\ncell/mL. If cells are seeded at too low a density they will go through a lag\nphase of growth, grow very slowly, or die out completely. If cell densities\nare allowed to become too high, the cells may exhaust the nutrients in the\nmedium and die abruptly. Recommended seeding and subculturing densities, media\nreplenishment (feeding) schedules, and medium formulations for each ATCC cell\nline are provided on the Product Sheet as well as in the catalog description\non the website.\n\n#### Suspension cell subculturing\n\n  1. Bring the complete growth medium to the appropriate temperature (usually 37\u00b0C) in a water bath. \n  2. Thoroughly mix the cell/medium suspension; use a pipette to suspend cells grown in stationary flasks. Remove a small amount of the cell suspension to determine the cell density and viability using a hemocytometer and vital stain. \n  3. Calculate the volume of cells required to re-seed the flask at the minimum density for that cell line, taking into consideration the amount of fresh medium that will be used. \n  4. Add the appropriate volume of medium to the culture vessel and then add the cell suspension. Do not add the concentrated cell suspension to an empty flask. The same culture vessel can be reused, but the chances of contamination increase with each reseeding due to the buildup of small spills of medium on the flask opening. \n  5. If necessary, \u201cgas\u201d the atmosphere of the flask with sterile-filtered CO2, seal the flask, and then incubate at the appropriate temperature. \n\nIt is generally not necessary to completely change the medium unless the cells\nattain a very high density or the medium has an acidic pH (yellow in color\nfrom the phenol red). To completely replace the medium, centrifuge the cells\ngently (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g), decant the medium, and then resuspend the\ncells in fresh medium at the lower seeding density.\n\n#### Troubleshooting suspension cell subculturing\n\n**Viability is lower than expected.**\n\n  * The cell suspension was left too long at too high a cell concentration prior to subculture. In this case, the medium will have a low pH and be yellow in color. Completely change the medium by gently centrifuging the cells and resuspend in fresh medium at the lower seeding density. \n  * The cell suspension was diluted below the recommended cell density range. Recover the cells by centrifugation and resuspend in fresh medium at the appropriate cell density. \n  * The harvesting procedure was too harsh (pipetting too vigorous, cells were centrifuged too hard or too long, cells damaged during scraping or banging). \n  * The medium was faulty. Use the recommended formulation and make sure it contains all of the required additives. \n\n#### Adapting a monolayer cell line to grow in suspension\n\nSome cell lines such as L-929 (ATCC CCL-1), HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) and BHK-21 (ATCC\nCCL-10) can be adapted to grow in suspension. With time, a population of cells\ncan be selected that does not self-aggregate or adhere to a growth surface as\nreadily as the parental line. However, the newly selected line may have lost\nor acquired characteristics that are different from the original cell\npopulation. In most cases it will be necessary to maintain the culture in\nsuspension with mechanical stirring. Keep in mind that most anchorage-\ndependent cells will grow in suspension only with the use of microcarrier\nbeads.\n\nThe procedure below was developed for BHK-21 cells,4 but can be used as a\nstarting point for most cell lines.\n\n  1. Dissociate the cell monolayer using standard procedures. Centrifuge and resuspend the cell suspension in an appropriate spinner medium such as Joklik\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM). Spinner media have reduced levels of calcium and magnesium.\n  2. Count the cell suspension, and then seed two or more spinner flasks with 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL. This density may need to be adjusted for your particular cell line. The sides of the culture flask may need to be siliconized to prevent the cells from sticking to the glass. \n  3. Observe the cultures daily. Remove samples and record the number of viable cells for each flask. \n  4. Every three days, collect the cells growing in suspension by centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g). Count, and re-seed a fresh flask with fresh medium at 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL. Depending on how well (or not) the cells adapt to growth in suspension, they may need to be combined with cells from different flasks to achieve the necessary cell density. \n  5. If there is a significant amount of cells attached to the walls of the culture vessel, particularly at the surface of the medium, remove them with trypsin-EDTA and discard them. If the cells in suspension are badly clumped, they can be dispersed with the trypsin-EDTA solution, collected by centrifugation, and then re-seeded into the flask as the appropriate density. This treatment may be necessary for the first few subcultures. \n  6. Continue to monitor the cells and subculture them every three days. Over time, they should adapt to growth in suspension and attain a constant growth rate. \n\nA complete growth medium consists of a basal cell culture medium supplemented\nwith ingredients such as sera, growth factors, trace elements, and hormones.\nThere are numerous formulations ranging from simple, basic mixtures containing\nthe minimum requirements for growing many cell lines to complex serum-free\nmixtures specific for growing a single fastidious cell line. The choice of a\nmedium for a particular cell line is somewhat empirical. Many medium\nformulations are available commercially in powder or liquid form. (See: NOTE\n6)\n\nATCC lists complete medium formulations, plus all handling and passage\ninformation, for all ATCC cell lines both in the online catalog description\nand on the Product Sheet. Additionally, ATCC offers a full line of media,\nsera, and reagents for culturing cells. These are the same reagents used at\nATCC for cell growth and propagation. See descriptions of ATCC cell culture\nproducts.\n\n**NOTE 6**  \nFormulations can vary widely among suppliers, even for media with similar or\nidentical names. Be sure to read catalog descriptions, formulations, and\nmedium labels carefully to ensure that the appropriate medium is used. For\nbest results start cell cultures in the same medium used and distributed by\nATCC (listed on the Product Sheet).\n\n### Complete growth media\n\n#### Cell culture media\n\nCell culture media are complex mixtures of salts, carbohydrates, vitamins,\namino acids, metabolic precursors, growth factors, hormones, and trace\nelements. The requirements for these components vary among cell lines, and\nthese differences are partly responsible for the extensive number of medium\nformulations. Carbohydrates are supplied primarily in the form of glucose. In\nsome instances, glucose is replaced with galactose to decrease lactic acid\nbuild-up, as galactose is metabolized at a slower rate. Other carbon sources\ninclude amino acids (particularly L-glutamine) and pyruvate.\n\nIn addition to nutrients, the medium helps maintain the pH and osmolality in a\nculture system. The pH is maintained by one or more buffering systems;\nCO2/sodium bicarbonate, phosphate, and HEPES are the most common. Sera will\nalso buffer a complete medium. Phenol red, a pH indicator, is added to medium\nto colorimetrically monitor changes in pH. Commonly used culture media include\nthe following:\n\n**Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium** (EMEM) was among the first widely used\nmedia and was formulated by Harry Eagle from his earlier and simpler basal\nmedium (BME). BME was developed for culturing mouse L cells (ATCC CCL-1) and\nHeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2). Over time, there have been numerous variations on the\nEMEM formula for different applications. ATCC EMEM (ATCC 30-2003) contains\nEarle\u2019s balanced salt solution, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate.\nIt is formulated with a reduced sodium bicarbonate concentration (1,500 mg/l)\nfor use with 5% CO2 (see Sodium Bicarbonate and Buffering). Because EMEM is a\nsimple medium, it is often fortified with additional supplements or higher\nlevels of serum.\n\n**Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium** (DMEM) has roughly twice the\nconcentration of amino acids and four times the amount of vitamins as EMEM, as\nwell as ferric nitrate, sodium pyruvate, and some supplementary amino acids\n(though not all nonessential amino acids). The original formulation contained\n1,000 mg/L of glucose, but in the more commonly used variations this amount\nwas increased to 4,500 mg/L.\n\nATCC DMEM (ATCC 30-2002) has 4,500 mg/L of glucose and a reduced sodium\nbicarbonate concentration (1,500 mg/L) for use with 5% CO2.\n\n**Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium** (IMDM) was formulated for growth of\nlymphocytes and hybridomas. Compared to DMEM, it has additional amino acids,\nvitamins and inorganic salts. Potassium nitrate was substituted for ferric\nnitrate. It also contains HEPES and selenium. ATCC IMDM (ATCC 30-2005) has a\nreduced sodium bicarbonate concentration (1,500 mg/L) for use with 5% CO2.\n\n**Hybri-Care Medium** (ATCC 46-X) is a combination and modification of DMEM\nand NCTC 135 medium supplemented with insulin, oxalacetic acid, and HEPES. It\nis based on the formulation used by David H. Sachs and collaborators5 for the\npropagation of hybridomas and other fastidious cell lines.\n\n**McCoy\u2019s 5A** and **RPMI-1640** were developed at Roswell Park Memorial\nInstitute (RPMI) in Buffalo, New York. McCoy\u2019s 5A (ATCC 30-2007) was\noriginally used to grow Novikoff hepatoma cells and will support the growth of\nprimary cultures.\n\nRPMI-1640 is a modification of McCoy\u2019s 5A and was developed for the long-term\nculture of peripheral blood lymphocytes. RPMI-1640 will support the growth of\na wide variety of cells in suspension as well as a number of cells grown as\nmonolayers.\n\nATCC RPMI-1640 (ATCC 30-2001) was modified to contain higher amounts of\nglucose (4,500 mg/L), sodium pyruvate, and HEPES buffer. It also contains a\nreduced concentration of sodium bicarbonate (1,500 mg/L) for use with 5% CO2.\n\n**Ham\u2019s Nutrient Mixtures** were originally developed to support the clonal\noutgrowth of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC CCL-61). As with EMEM,\nthere have been numerous modifications to the original formulation including\nHam\u2019s F-12 medium, a more complex formulation than the original F-10 suitable\nfor serum-free propagation.\n\n**Kaighn\u2019s modification of Ham\u2019s F-12** (Ham\u2019s F-12K) was designed to support\nthe growth and differentiation of primary cells with or without serum. F-12K\nhas increased amounts of amino acids, pyruvate, biotin, calcium, magnesium,\nputrescine, and phenol red in addition to other modifications from the F-12\nformula. ATCC Ham\u2019s F-12K (ATCC 30-2004) has a reduced sodium bicarbonate\nconcentration (1,500 mg/L) for use with 5% CO2.\n\n**DMEM/F12 Medium** is a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco\u2019s modified EMEM and Ham\u2019s\nF-12. It is an extremely rich and complex medium and will support the growth\nof a broad range of cell types in both serum and serum-free formulations.\n\nATCC DMEM/F12 medium (ATCC 30-2006) has a reduced sodium bicarbonate\nconcentration (1,500 mg/L) for use with 5% CO2.\n\n**Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 Medium** (ATCC 30-2008) is formulated for use without CO2\nincubation as is found in teaching laboratories or when collecting biopsy\nsamples. The standard sodium bicarbonate/CO2 buffering system is replaced by a\ncombination of phosphate buffers, free-base amino acids, higher levels of\nsodium pyruvate, and galactose. Cell cultures can be grown in CO2 incubators\nwith L-15 medium provided there is no exchange between the air in the culture\nvessel with that of the incubator (ie, caps of flasks are tightly closed).\n\n#### Media formulations\n\nFormulations of media available from ATCC can be found online. Please note\nthat there are cell lines in the collection that require media not currently\nsold by ATCC.\n\n#### Media ingredients\n\n**Sodium bicarbonate and buffering**\n\nCells produce and require small amounts of carbon dioxide for growth and\nsurvival.6 In culture media, dissolved CO2 is in equilibrium with bicarbonate\nions and many medium formulations take advantage of this CO2/bicarbonate\nreaction to buffer the pH of the medium. CO2 dissolves freely into the medium\nand reacts with water to form carbonic acid. As the cells metabolize and\nproduce more CO2, the pH of the medium decreases as the chemical reaction\nbelow is driven to the right:\n\n**H 2O + CO2     \u2194     H2CO3     \u2194     H+ \\+ HCO3-**\n\nThe optimal pH range of 7.2 to 7.4 can be maintained by supplementing the\nmedium with sodium bicarbonate and regulating the level of CO2 in the\natmosphere above the medium as shown by the reaction below:\n\n**H 2O + CO2 \\+ NaHCO3     \u2194     H+ \\+ Na+ \\+ 2HCO3-**\n\nIn tissue culture, cells are grown either in open systems (where there is free\nexchange of the atmosphere immediately above the medium with the atmosphere of\nthe incubator) or in closed systems (where the two atmospheres are kept\nseparate). The buffering system employed in the medium needs to be matched to\nthe culture system. Otherwise the cells may be subject to metabolic stress\nwhich will impair their performance.\n\nIn closed systems the level of CO2 is regulated by the metabolism of the\ncells. The culture vessel must be sealed (flasks tightly capped) to retain any\nCO2 generated by the cells. Consequently, closed systems provide additional\nprotection against contamination and have simpler incubator requirements than\nopen systems. Closed systems usually require media with buffers based on\nHanks\u2019 balanced salt solution having relatively low levels of sodium\nbicarbonate.\n\nIn open systems, humidity (to reduce evaporation) and a means of regulating\nCO2 levels (if the culture medium contains sodium bicarbonate) are required\nduring incubation to maintain the pH of the culture medium. Open systems\nusually require the higher levels of sodium bicarbonate found in Earle\u2019s salt\nsolution combined with a 5 to 10% CO2 atmosphere supplied by the incubator. In\ngeneral, 1.2 g/L to 2.2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate is used with 5% CO2 whereas\n3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate is used with 10% CO2. The exact amount will depend\nupon the medium formulation.\n\nIn some cases, researchers \u201cgas\u201d the atmosphere of the culture vessel with a\nstream of sterile-filtered 5% CO2/95% air mixture and then tightly seal the\nflask prior to incubation in a nonhumidified and non-CO2 incubator.7 While\nthese culture vessels work with simpler non-humidified, non-CO2 incubators,\nthe medium requirements are those of an open system.\n\nAll ATCC media, with the exception of Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 (ATCC 30-2008), are\ndesigned to be used with 5% CO2 levels. Most have a sodium bicarbonate\nconcentration of 1.5 g/L and are supplemented with extra sodium pyruvate. ATCC\nmodification of McCoy\u2019s 5A (ATCC 30-2007) has a slightly higher levels of\nsodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/L) and does not contain sodium pyruvate.\n\nWhile most commercial formulations of liquid media do contain the appropriate\namount of sodium bicarbonate, it is generally omitted from the powdered form\nand needs to be added before use. Some medium formulations incorporate other\nbuffering systems such as phosphate or HEPES in addition to CO2/sodium\nbicarbonate. These media have the advantage of maintaining optimal pH in an\nopen system when the culture vessel is removed from the enriched CO2\natmosphere of the incubator.\n\n**HEPES buffer**\n\nHEPES and other organic buffers can be used with many cell lines to\neffectively buffer the pH of the medium.8 Indeed, some standard medium\nformulations include HEPES. However, this compound can be toxic, especially\nfor some differentiated cell types, so evaluate its effects before use.9 HEPES\nhas been shown to greatly increase the sensitivity of media to the phototoxic\neffects induced by exposure to fluorescent light.10,11\n\n**Phenol red**\n\nPhenol red is used to monitor the pH of media. During cell growth, the medium\nchanges color as it changes pH due to metabolites released by the cells. At\nlow pH levels, phenol red turns the medium yellow, while at higher pH levels\nit turns the medium purple. For most tissue culture work (pH 7.4), the medium\nshould be bright red.\n\nUnfortunately, phenol red can mimic the action of some steroid hormones,\nparticularly estrogen. For studies with estrogen-sensitive cells, such as\nmammary tissue, use media without phenol red. Additionally, the sodium-\npotassium ion homeostasis is upset when phenol red is included in some serum-\nfree formulations; this effect is neutralized by the inclusion of serum or\nbovine pituitary hormone in the medium.12 Phenol red is frequently omitted\nfrom studies with flow cytometry as its color interferes with detection.\n\n**L-Glutamine**\n\nL-Glutamine (ATCC 30-2214) is an essential amino acid required by virtually\nall mammalian and insect cells grown in culture. It is used for protein\nproduction, as an energy source, and in nucleic acid metabolism. It is also\nmore labile in liquid cell culture media than other amino acids. The rate and\nextent of L-glutamine degradation are related to storage temperatures, age of\nthe product, and pH.\n\nBecause L-glutamine is so labile, it is often omitted from commercial liquid\nmedium preparations to lengthen the product shelf life. In these cases, it\nmust be aseptically added prior to use. L-Glutamine is not as labile in dry\nform and most powdered medium formulations do include it.\n\nIn some cases, the addition of L-glutamine to complete cell culture medium can\nextend the usable life of the medium. If L-glutamine is suspected to be a\nlimiting factor during cell culture, a simple test of \u2018spiking\u2019 the medium\nwith a small amount of L-glutamine will determine whether or not more is\nrequired. Simply add a small amount of L-glutamine (~2 mM final concentration)\nto the culture medium. If the cell growth rate increases, L-glutamine is most\nlikely deficient and more should be added. Alternately, the concentration of\nL-glutamine can be measured directly by standard analytical means such as HPLC\n(High Performance Liquid Chromatography).\n\nL-Glutamine concentrations for mammalian cell culture media can vary from 0.68\nmM in Medium 199 to 4 mM in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium. Invertebrate\ncell culture media, such as Schneider\u2019s Drosophila medium, may contain as much\nas 12.3 mM L-glutamine.\n\nUse caution when adding more L-glutamine than is called for in the original\nmedium formulation. L-Glutamine degradation results in the build-up of ammonia\nwhich can have a deleterious effect on some cell lines. For most cell lines,\nammonia toxicity is more critical for cell viability than L-glutamine\nlimitation.\n\n**Nonessential amino acids**\n\nAll medium formulations contain the ten essential amino acids as well as\ncysteine, glutamine, and tyrosine. The inclusion of the other non-essential\namino acids (alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, glutamic acid,\nproline, and serine) in some media formulations reduces the metabolic burden\non the cells allowing for an increase in cellular proliferation.\n\n**Sodium pyruvate**\n\nPyruvate is an intermediary organic acid metabolite in glycolysis and the\nfirst component of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. It can pass readily into or\nout of the cell. Its addition to tissue culture medium provides both an energy\nsource and a carbon skeleton for anabolic processes. Pyruvate may help in\nmaintaining certain specialized cells, in clonal selection, in reducing the\nserum concentration of the medium,7 and in reducing fluorescent light-induced\nphototoxicity.10 Cellular metabolism of pyruvate produces carbon dioxide which\nis given off into the atmosphere and becomes bicarbonate in the medium. Sodium\npyruvate is added to give a final concentration of 1 mM in most media, but is\nincreased to 5 mM in Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 medium primarily to facilitate use in\nCO2-free environments.\n\n#### Media supplements\n\nThe complete growth media recommended for some cell lines requires the\naddition of components not already available in the base media and serum.\nThese components include hormones, growth factors and signaling substances\nthat sustain proliferation and maintain normal cell metabolism.\n\nSupplements are usually prepared as 100\u00d7 (or higher) stock solutions in serum-\nfree medium. Some supplements may need to be dissolved in a solvent prior to\nsubsequent dilution in serum-free medium to the stock concentration. Stock\nconcentrations should be aliquoted into small volumes and stored at an\nappropriate temperature; most stock concentrations can be stored at \u201380\u00b0C, but\ncheck with your supplier prior to storing.\n\nThe addition of supplements can change the final osmolality of the complete\ngrowth medium, which may have a negative effect on the growth of cells in\nculture. It is best to recheck the osmolality of the complete growth medium\nafter small volumes of supplement stock solutions are added; optimal\nosmolality for most vertebrate cell lines should fall between 260 mOSM/kg and\n320 mOSM/kg.\n\nAfter supplements have been added to a base medium, the shelf life of the\ncomplete growth medium should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Complete\nmedia containing protein supplements (eg, epidermal growth factor, bovine\nserum albumin, etc.) tend to degrade faster than base media alone. Most\ncomplete growth media can be stored in aliquots at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for about a\nmonth. However, if any supplement is expected to expire before the one-month\nperiod has passed, the expiration date for the complete growth media should\nfollow suit. Some fastidious cell lines may require that components be added\nimmediately before use. Do not freeze complete growth medium. Freezing cell\nculture media at \u201370\u00b0C or below causes some of the growth factors and/or\nvitamins to precipitate out of solution. It can be very difficult to get these\ncomponents to go back into solution after thawing, even if warmed to 37\u00b0C.\nATCC recommends storing media between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C, away from light.\n\nFor additional information regarding the preparation, storage, or usage of\nspecific supplements, contact your local supplier or consult with the\nmanufacturer\u2019s Product Information Sheet.\n\n#### Osmolality\n\nThe osmolality of cell culture media for most vertebrate cells is kept within\na narrow range from 260 mOsm/kg to 320 mOsm/kg, even though most established\ncell lines will tolerate a rather large variation in osmotic pressure. In\ncontrast, the osmolality requirements for some invertebrate cell lines fall\noutside of this range. For example, the snail embryo requires medium of about\n155 mOsm/kg, while some insect cells prefer 360 mOsm/kg to 375 mOsm/kg. Most\ncommercially available liquid media report osmolality and it is advisable to\ncheck the osmolality of any medium after the addition of saline solutions,\ndrugs or hormones dissolved in an acid or base solution, or large volumes of\nbuffers (eg, HEPES).\n\n#### Antibiotics and antimycotics\n\nAntibiotics and/or antimycotic agents are added to cell culture media as a\nprophylactic to prevent contamination, as a cure once contamination is found,\nto induce the expression of recombinant proteins, or to maintain selective\npressure on transfected cells.\n\nRoutine use of antibiotics or antimycotics for cell culture is not recommended\nunless they are specifically required, such as G418 for maintaining selective\npressure on transfected cells. Antibiotics can mask contamination by\nmycoplasma and resistant bacteria. Further, they can interfere with the\nmetabolism of sensitive cells. Avoid antimycotics as they can be toxic to many\ncell lines.\n\nWhile cell lines can be cured of microbial contamination with antibiotics\nand/or antimycotics, this is not recommend unless the cell line is\nirreplaceable; the process is lengthy and there is no guarantee contamination\nwill be eliminated. Even if the contamination is eliminated, there is no way\nof ensuring that the resulting cell line will have the same characteristics as\nthe initial one due to the stress of the treatment. It is best to discard the\ncell line and start over with new stocks. Mycoplasma contamination in\nparticular is very difficult to eliminate. In some cases, antibiotic use for\nshort periods of time can serve as a valuable prophylactic. For example,\nantibiotic use is recommended when developing and working with primary culture\nand when using flow cytometry to isolate subpopulations.\n\nIf an antibiotic is used in medium, penicillin-streptomycin solution (ATCC\n30-2300) can be added at 0.5 to 1 mL of solution per 100 mL of cell culture\nmedium for a final concentration of 50 to 100 IU/mL penicillin and 50 to 100\n\u00b5g/mL streptomycin. Gentamicin sulfate, another antibiotic, is used at 50 to\n100 \u00b5g/mL. The antimycotic amphotericin B is used at 2.5 \u00b5g/mL.13 These\nconcentrations apply to media that contain serum. For serum-free media, reduce\nthe concentrations by at least 50%.\n\n#### Animal sera\n\nSera serve as a source for amino acids, proteins, vitamins (particularly fat-\nsoluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K), carbohydrates, lipids, hormones,\ngrowth factors, minerals, and trace elements. Additionally, serum buffers the\nculture medium, inactivates proteolytic enzymes, increases medium viscosity\n(which reduces shear stress during pipetting or stirring), and conditions the\ngrowth surface of the culture vessel. The exact composition is unknown and\nvaries from lot to lot, although lot-to-lot consistency has improved in recent\nyears.\n\nSera from fetal and calf bovine sources are commonly used to support the\ngrowth of cells in culture. Fetal serum is a rich source of growth factors and\nis appropriate for cell cloning and for the growth of fastidious cells. Calf\nserum, because of its lower growth-promoting properties, is used in contact-\ninhibition studies with NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658). In contrast to fetal or\ncalf sera, horse serum is collected from a closed herd of adult animals\nensuring lot-to-lot consistency. Horse serum is less likely to carry the\ncontaminants found in bovine sera such as viruses and less likely to\nmetabolize polyamines which may be mitogenic for some cells. Horse and bovine\ncalf sera are less expensive and more readily available than fetal bovine\nserum. The pricing and availability of fetal serum fluctuates considerably.\n\nUnfortunately, naturally derived products from bovine sources may contain\nadventitious viruses such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine\nparvovirus, bovine adenovirus, and blue tongue virus. All reputable suppliers\ntest their products for infectious virus by several methods including\nfluorescent antibody, cytopathic effect, and hemadsorption. These products are\nalso screened for the standard microbial contaminants such as bacteria, fungi,\nand mycoplasma.\n\nBVDV, in contrast to the other virus contaminants, is present in nearly all\nbovine serum at very low levels even when tests for infectious virus are\nnegative. Fortunately, very few cell lines (except those of bovine origin) are\nsusceptible to this virus. For the few sensitive cell lines, use non-bovine\nsera or irradiated bovine sera. Several ATCC cell lines were tested for BVDV\ncontamination14 and the results of this study are indicated in the cell line\ndescription on the website. Bovine-derived products also may contain the agent\nresponsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Unfortunately, there\nis no test for the presence of this agent and we highly recommend that you\nobtain all bovine products (including sera) from countries not affected by BSE\nsuch as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nAt one time animal serum was a major source of mycoplasma contamination of\ntissue culture cells. However, nearly all sera today are filtered through\nseveral 0.1-\u00b5m pore (or smaller) filters which effectively remove this\norganism.\n\n**ATCC offers the following three types of animal sera:**\n\n  * Fetal Bovine Serum (also known as fetal calf) \u2014 ATCC 30-2020 \n  * Fetal Bovine Serum qualified for embryonic stem cells \u2014 ATCC SCRR-30-2020 \n  * Iron-supplemented Calf Bovine Serum \u2014 ATCC 30-2030 \n\nThese products are rigorously tested for adventitious infective agents and\nsourced from only U.S. herds. Further, each lot is tested for its ability to\nsupport cell growth and is the same sera used in ATCC labs.\n\n**Storage**\n\nStore sera at \u221220\u00b0C or colder for storage over 30 days. ATCC sera are\nroutinely stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Do not store sera at temperatures above \u221220\u00b0C for\nany length of time. Avoid repeated freeze-thaws by dispensing and storing in\naliquots.\n\n**Thawing**\n\nThe following procedure is used to thaw serum:\n\n  1. Place frozen serum in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C overnight. \n  2. Put the bottles in a 37\u00b0C water bath and gently agitate from time to time to mix the solutes that tend to concentrate at the bottom of the bottle. \n\nDo not keep the serum at 37\u00b0C any longer than necessary to thaw it, and do not\nthaw the serum at higher temperatures. Thawing serum in a bath above 40\u00b0C\nwithout mixing may lead to the formation of a precipitate inside the bottle.\n\n**Turbidity and precipitates**\n\nAll sera may retain some fibrinogen. Because external factors may initiate the\nconversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, flocculent material or turbidity may be\nobserved after serum is thawed. The presence of this material does not alter\nthe serum\u2019s performance. If the presence of flocculent material or turbidity\nis a concern, it can be removed by filtration through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter.\n\nA precipitate can form in serum when incubated at 37\u00b0C or higher for prolonged\nperiods of time which may be mistaken for microbial contamination. This\nprecipitate may include crystals of calcium phosphate, but does not alter the\nperformance of the serum as a supplement for cell culture. Heat inactivation\nof sera can also cause the formation of precipitates.\n\n**Heat inactivation**\n\nATCC does not routinely use heat-inactivated serum unless specifically\nrequired for a particular cell line. Heat inactivation is usually unnecessary\nand can be detrimental to the growth of some cells. It will reduce or destroy\ngrowth factors present in the serum.\n\nHeat inactivation was originally performed to inactivate complement (a group\nof proteins present in sera that are part of the immune response) as well as\nto destroy mycoplasma contaminants. Today, mycoplasma contamination, if any,\nis removed by filtration. Removal of complement is usually unnecessary, but\ncan be important when preparing or assaying viruses or in cytotoxicity tests.\nAccording to a study by HyClone,15 warming serum to 37\u00b0C inactivates heat-\nlabile complement factors. A few types of cell lines grow better in heat-\ninactivated sera such as embryonic stem cells16 and many insect cell lines.17\n\nThe following procedure can be used to heat-inactivate serum:\n\n  1. Thaw serum. \n  2. Preheat a water bath to 56\u00b0C. Use sufficient water to immerse the bottle above the level of serum. \n  3. Mix thawed serum by gentle inversion and place in the 56\u00b0C bath. The temperature of the water bath will drop. \n  4. When the temperature of the water bath reaches 56\u00b0C again, continue to heat for an additional 30 minutes. Mix gently every 5 minutes to insure uniform heating. \n  5. Remove serum from water bath, cool quickly (slow cooling can sometimes reverse the inactivation of complement activity), and store at \u221220\u00b0C or colder. \n\n### Culture vessels and surfaces\n\n#### Vessels\n\nCulture vessels provide a contamination barrier to protect the cultures from\nthe external environment while maintaining the proper internal environment.\nFor anchorage-dependent cells, the vessels provide a suitable and consistent\nsubstrate for cell attachment. Other characteristics of vessels include easy\naccess to the cultures and optically clear viewing surfaces.18\n\nOriginally all culture vessels were glass. Drawbacks for glass include the\nheavy weight, expense, labor-intensive cleaning, and poor microscopic viewing\ncompared to plastic. By the 1960s, surface treatment techniques were developed\nfor polystyrene, allowing plastic vessels to replace glass for most cell\nculture applications.\n\nThe information below focuses on standard culture vessels used by many\nresearchers. Large-scale culture equipment is not included.\n\n**Selecting the right vessel**\n\nFirst, match the characteristics of the cells to be grown with the\ncharacteristics of the different culturing systems. There are three basic\ntypes of cell cultures:\n\n  * Anchorage dependent, which must become attached to a surface to grow (for example, human diploid fibroblasts). \n  * Anchorage independent, which grow in suspension (most blood-derived cell cultures). \n  * Cells that can grow either attached or in suspension (many transformed cell lines such as HeLa and BHK-21). \n\nUnderstand the growth requirements of the cultures to help select the best\nculture system. There are four basic culture systems:\n\n  * Stationary monolayer cultures which are grown in undisturbed flasks, dishes, and multiwell plates. These are the easiest culture systems to use and require the least amount of equipment. However, these systems are very labor intensive for producing large quantities of cells. \n  * Moving monolayer cultures which are grown primarily in roller bottles. These vessels are slowly rotated (approximately 0.5 rpm to 1 rpm) on motorized racks or drums and are widely used for producing large quantities of cells. Roller bottles employ simple technology but require an investment in the appropriate equipment. \n  * Stationary suspension cultures which are grown without agitation in untreated dishes and flasks. These are best for growing small volumes of anchorage-independent cells that grow poorly in traditional stirred suspension cultures. \n  * Moving suspension cultures which are grown in mechanically stirred vessels (spinner flasks), bioreactors, or fermentors. These systems are the most economical in terms of space, labor and media; as a result, stirred suspension cultures are usually the method of choice for producing large volumes of cells both in the lab and in industry. Many anchorage-dependent cells can be adapted to grow on microcarriers to take advantage of these systems. \n\nNext, decide whether the cells will be grown as an open system or as a closed\nsystem (see the section on sodium bicarbonate). Open-system plastic dishes are\nless expensive than closed-system flasks, but require more expensive\nincubators that can regulate the CO2 and humidity in the atmosphere. Closed\nsystems provide additional protection against contamination and have simpler\nincubator requirements. All dishes and multiwell plates are open systems. All\nother culture vessels can be used in either mode by leaving caps loose for an\nopen system or tightened for a closed system. The plastic walls of culture\nvessels are slightly permeable to carbon dioxide and oxygen, permitting a very\nsmall amount of gas exchange. This is not a problem in most culture\napplications, but may interfere with anoxia experiments or long-term storage\nof media.19 Caps that allow gas exchange when the cap is fully tightened are\navailable to reduce opportunities for flask spills and contamination in open\nsystems.\n\nThe last step is matching the desired cell yield with an appropriately sized\nculture vessel. For monolayer cultures, the yield is limited by the area of\ntreated growth surface. Approximately 0.5 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2 to 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2\nof treated surface is a typical yield for confluent continuous mammalian cell\nlines. For suspension cultures the total cell yield is determined by the\nworking volume of the vessel. In stirred systems, cell concentrations can\neasily reach between 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL of medium. However,\nthe exact yields will need to be determined empirically for each cell line.\nATCC strongly recommends that cells be maintained in the logarithmic phase of\ngrowth, and not be allowed to enter the stationary phase. Anchorage-dependent\ncell lines are routinely passaged or split before they reach confluency.\n\n**Flasks**\n\nAlexis Carrel developed the first glass flasks in the 1920s. Harry Earle\ndeveloped the more traditional straight neck rectangular (also hexagonal)\nglass T-flasks in the 1940s. Today, plastic flasks are available with a range\nof growing areas, a variety of shapes, with several different neck designs.\nChoice of design depends on the cell culture techniques used as well as\npersonal preference. The more common sizes are listed below.\n\nDescription  | Growth area (cm2)  | Recommended working volume (mL)  | Cell\nyield*  \n---|---|---|---  \nT-25  | 25  | 5 to 10  | 2.5 \u00d7 106  \nT-75  | 75  | 15 to 25  | 7.5 \u00d7 106  \nT-150  | 150  | 30 to 50  | 15.0 \u00d7 106  \nT-175  | 175  | 35 to 60  | 17.5 \u00d7 106  \nT-225  | 225  | 45 to 75  | 22.5 \u00d7 106  \n  \n*Cell line dependent. Based upon a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2. \n\n**Cell culture dishes**\n\nCell culture dishes offer the best economy and access to the growth surface.\nThis makes them the vessels of choice for cloning or other manipulations such\nas scraping that require direct access to the cell monolayer. They must be\nused with incubators that control CO2 and humidity. Most manufacturers offer\ndishes in four diameters: 35 mm, 60 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm. These are nominal\ndiameters and may not be the actual diameter of the growth surface. Cell\nculture dishes are available with either specially treated surfaces for\ngrowing anchorage-dependent cells, or untreated (native) surfaces for growing\nsuspension cultures where attachment is not desired.\n\nDescription  | Growth area (cm2)  | Working volume (mL)  | Cell yield*  \n---|---|---|---  \n35  | 8  | 1 to 2  | 0.8 \u00d7 106  \n60  | 21  | 4 to 5  | 2.1 \u00d7 106  \n100  | 55  | 10 to 12  | 5.5 \u00d7 106  \n150  | 148  | 28 to 32  | 14.8 \u00d7 106  \n  \n*Cell line dependent. Based upon a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2. \n\n**Multiwell plates**\n\nThese widely used vessels were originally designed for virus titration, but\nhave since become popular in many other applications, especially hybridoma\nproduction, high-throughput screening, and toxicity testing. Multiwell plates\noffer significant savings in space, media, and reagents when compared to an\nequal number of dishes. They are more convenient to handle, especially if the\npipettors, plate washers, readers, and other equipment for processing these\nplates are used. They must be used with incubators that control humidity and\nCO2 levels.\n\nDescription  | Growth well (cm2)  | Working volume/ well (mL)  | Cell yield*  \n---|---|---|---  \n96-well  | 0.32  | 0.1 to 0.2  | 0.32 \u00d7 105  \n48-well  | 1.00  | 0.3 to 0.6  | 0.8 \u00d7 105  \n24-well  | 1.88  | 0.5 to 1.2  | 1.9 \u00d7 105  \n12-well  | 3.83  | 1.0 to 2.4  | 3.8 \u00d7 105  \n6-well  | 9.40  | 2.0 to 3.0  | 9.5 \u00d7 105  \n  \n*Cell line dependent. Based upon a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2. \n\n**Roller bottles**\n\nThe roller bottle was developed for cultivating large numbers of anchorage-\ndependent cells.20 Today they provide a more economical means for cultivating\nlarge volumes of cells using essentially the same culture techniques as with\nflasks but with considerably less labor. Besides the traditional smooth wall\ndesign, roller bottles are available with small ridges that approximately\ndouble the surface area available for growing cells without increasing the\ndimensions of the bottles.\n\nDescription  | Growth area (cm2)  | Working volume (mL)  | Cell yield*  \n---|---|---|---  \nSmall  | 490  | 100 to 150  | 4.9 \u00d7 107  \nStandard  | 850  | 170 to 250  | 8.5 \u00d7 107  \nPharmaceutical  | 1750  | 340 to 500  | 17.5 \u00d7 107  \n  \n*Cell line dependent. Based upon a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2. \n\n#### Surface coatings and feeder cells\n\nMost tissue culture work uses disposable polystyrene vessels. The vessel\nsurface is treated to render it hydrophilic (wettable). Most cell lines in the\nATCC collection are cultivated on treated plastic surfaces in dishes, flasks,\nor roller bottles. Since the properties of tissue culture plastic can vary\namong manufacturers, samples should be evaluated for their ability to support\ncell growth and propagation prior to use. ATCC routinely uses the SelecT fully\nautomated cell culture system. Some fastidious cell lines require further\ntreatment of the growth surface before they will attach and proliferate. The\nmost common techniques include coating the surface with serum, collagen,\nlaminin, gelatin (ATCC PCS-999-027), poly-L-lysine, or fibronectin.\n\nBeyond simple attachment, some cells require specialized surface treatment in\norder for them to differentiate into more tissue-like formations. For example,\nendothelial cells will form tubules and neuronal cells will extend neurite\nprocesses when cultured on a surface of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.\nThese ECM proteins closely resemble the basal lamina membrane surrounding\ncells in tissue and not only provide attachment points, but modulate signal\ntransduction from external growth factors and hormones, influence the\npermeability of ions and nutrients, and actively \u201ccommunicate\u201d with\nintracellular processes through integrins.\n\nFinally, some cells, particularly when seeded at low densities as for cloning,\nrequire the support of living cells. Most cells are \u201chappier in a crowd.\u201d\nFeeder layer cells supply a crowd by conditioning the medium through metabolic\nleakage and/or the active secretion of growth and other factors. They also\nprovide a support matrix for cell attachment and proliferation. To prevent\nfeeder layer cells from overgrowing the cells of interest, they are treated to\nprevent division. Common methods include irradiation with X-rays or gamma rays\nor treatment with mitomycin C. Each of these treatments damages cellular DNA\nso that the cells continue to metabolize but can no longer proliferate. ATCC\noffers a variety of well-characterized feeder cells.\n\nATCC number | Product name  | Description  \n---|---|---  \nCRL-2581 | C166  | Mouse embryonic endothelial cells  \nCRL-2583 | C166\u2013GFP  | Mouse embryonic endothelial cells with GFP expression  \nCRL-2749 | OP9  | Mouse embryonic bone marrow stromal cells  \n55-X | IRR-MRC-5  | Irradiated MRC-5 cells (human diploid lung fibroblast)  \nSCRC-1007 | AFT024  | Mouse embryonic liver fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1007.1 | Irradiated AFT024  | Irradiated mouse embryonic liver\nfibroblasts  \nSCRC-1008 | MEF (C57BL/6)  | Mouse embryonic fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1008.1 | MEF (C57BL/6) IRR  | Irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1040 | MEF (CF-1)  | Mouse embryonic fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1040.1 | MEF (CF-1) IRR  | Irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1040.2a | MEF (CF-1) MITC  | Mitomycin C treated mouse embryonic\nfibroblasts  \nSCRC-1041 | HFF-1  | Human foreskin fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1041.1 | HFF-1 IRR  | Irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1045 | MEF (DR4)  | Multidrug resistant mouse fibroblasts  \nSCRC-1049 | SNL76/7  | STO fibroblasts with G418 resistance and endogenous\nexpression of LIF  \nSCRC-1050 | SNLP 76/7-4  | STO fibroblasts with resistance to G418 and\npuromycin plus endogenous expression of LIF  \n  \n\n\n### Cryopreservation\n\nMost cell cultures can be stored for many years, if not indefinitely, at\ntemperatures below \u2013130\u00b0C (cryopreservation). ATCC has recovered cells from\ncultures cryopreserved for more than 40 years. The many advantages of\ncryopreservation far outweigh the required investment in equipment and\nreagents. These advantages include:\n\n  * Generation of safety stocks to ensure against loss of the culture from equipment failures or contamination by microorganisms or other cell lines. \n  * Elimination of the time, energy, and materials required to maintain cultures not in immediate use. \n  * Preservation of cells with finite population doublings (that will ultimately senesce). \n  * Insurance against phenotypic drift in the culture due to genetic instability and/or selective pressure. \n  * Creating a standard reagent to be used for a series of experiments. \n\n#### Overview\n\nAs the cell suspension is cooled below the freezing point, ice crystals form\nand the concentration of the solutes in the suspension increases.\nIntracellular ice can be minimized if water within the cell is allowed to\nescape by osmosis during the cooling process. A slow cooling rate, generally\n\u20131\u00b0C per minute, facilitates this process. However, as the cells lose water,\nthey shrink in size and will quickly lose viability if they go beyond a\nminimum volume. The addition of cryoprotectant agents such as glycerol or\ndimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) will mitigate these effects.\n\nThe standard procedure for cryopreservation is to freeze cells slowly until\nthey reach a temperature below \u201370\u00b0C in medium that includes a cryoprotectant.\nVials are transferred to a liquid-nitrogen freezer to maintain them at\ntemperatures below \u2013130\u00b0C.\n\nThe recovery of cryopreserved cells is straightforward: Cells are thawed\nrapidly in a water bath at 37\u00b0C, removed from the freeze-medium by gentle\ncentrifugation and/or diluted with growth medium, and seeded in a culture\nvessel in complete growth medium.\n\nThere are numerous factors which affect the viability of recovered cells.\nModify the procedure for each cell line to attain optimal cell viability upon\nrecovery. Some of the critical parameters for optimization include the\ncomposition of the freeze medium, the growth phase of the culture, the stage\nof the cell in the cell cycle, and the number and concentration of cells\nwithin the freezing solution.\n\nATCC provides information on cryopreservation for all cell lines on the\nProduct Sheet. Most ATCC cell lines are frozen with a cryopreservation medium\nconsisting of 5% DMSO and complete growth medium.\n\n#### Freeze medium\n\nGlycerol and DMSO at 5% to 10% are the most common cryoprotectant agents.\nWhile DMSO can be toxic to cells, it penetrates them much faster than glycerol\nand yields more reproducible results. Unfortunately, DMSO can cause some cells\nto differentiate (eg, HL-60 promyeloblast cells) and may be too toxic for some\ncells (eg, HBE4-E6/E7 lung epithelial cells). Glycerol should be used in these\ninstances. Glycerol can be sterilized by autoclaving whereas DMSO must be\nsterilized by filtration. Care should be used when handling any DMSO solution\nas it will rapidly penetrate intact skin and may carry toxic contaminants\nalong with it.\n\nUse only reagent-grade (or better, such as cell culture-grade) DMSO or\nglycerol. Store both in aliquots protected from light. ATCC offers DMSO (ATCC\n4-X) that has been thoroughly tested for cell culture use.\n\nFor cells grown in serum-free medium, adding 50% conditioned medium (serum-\nfree medium in which the cells were grown for 24 hours) to both the cell\nfreezing and the recovery medium may improve recovery and survival. The\naddition of 10% to 20% cell culture-grade bovine serum albumin to serum-free\nfreezing medium may also increase postfreeze survival.\n\nSerum-free freezing media have also been developed. ATCC Serum-Free Cell\nFreezing Medium (ATCC 30-2600) can be used for both cells cultured in serum-\nsupplemented growth medium as well as cells grown under serum-free conditions.\nThis proprietary formulation contains 10% DMSO and methylcellulose is suitable\nfor the cryopreservation of adherent and suspension cell cultures. Cells\ncryopreserved using Serum-Free Freezing Medium show levels of viability and\npercent attachment (adherent cells) that are comparable to cells preserved in\nDMSO and FBS. (See: Figure 3)\n\n**Figure 3: Cells cryopreserved using ATCC Serum-Free Cell Freezing Medium\nshow levels of viability and percent attachment that are comparable to cells\npreserved in DMSO and FBS.**\n\nOther variations of freeze medium formulations include high (up to 90%)\nconcentrations of serum which presumably supplies some cryoprotection as well\nas additional growth factors; use of a balanced salt solution designed for\nhypothermal conditions in place of medium designed for 37\u00b0C incubation; and\nthe addition of apoptotic inhibitors which may prevent delayed onset cell\ndeath following recovery.21 Optimum formulations for individual cell lines\nneed to be determined empirically.\n\n#### Equipment\n\n**Cryopreservation vials**\n\nThere are two materials to choose from for cryopreservation vials: glass or\nplastic. Glass vials are more difficult to work with; they need to be\nsterilized before use, they do not come with labels (information is imprinted\ninto the glass), they need to be sealed with a hot flame, and they can be\ndifficult to open. However, they are preferred for long-term storage (many\nyears) of valuable cultures and are considered fail-safe once properly sealed.\nATCC uses glass vials for the storage of seed stocks which are placed in the\nlower level of the liquid nitrogen tank. Plastic vials are used for the\nstorage of distribution stocks.\n\nPlastic vials come in two varieties: those with an internal thread and\nsilicone gasket and those with an external thread. The internal-thread version\nwas the first commercially available, but has some disadvantages over the\nexternal-thread version. For example, while the silicone gasket provides an\nexcellent seal, it needs to be tightened just right; too tight or too loose\nand the vial will leak.\n\n**Controlled-rate freezing chambers**\n\nThere are several means to achieve a cooling rate of \u20131\u00b0C per minute. The best\nis with a computer controlled, programmable electronic freezing unit (such as\nCryoMed Freeze) which rigorously maintains this rate of cooling. This is the\nmethod used exclusively at ATCC. Such equipment is relatively expensive and\nabsolutely necessary for only the most sensitive cells.\n\nA less costly approach is to place the cryopreservation vials into an\ninsulated chamber and cool for 24 hours in a mechanical freezer at \u201370\u00b0C or\nlower. There are several commercially available freezing chambers which\nachieve a cooling rate very close to the ideal \u20131\u00b0C per minute (Mr. Frosty,\nNalgene 5100-0001; or StrataCooler, Agilent Technologies 401349). Alternately,\nthe vials can be placed into a polystyrene box with 15-mm (3/4 inch) thick\nwalls and 1L capacity packed with paper, cotton wool, or foam peanuts for\ninsulation.\n\n#### Liquid nitrogen freezer storage\n\nThe ultra-low temperatures (below \u2013130\u00b0C) required for long-term storage can\nbe maintained by specialized electric freezers or more commonly by liquid\nnitrogen freezers. There are two basic types of liquid nitrogen storage\nsystems: immersing vials in the liquid and holding vials in the vapor phase\nabove the liquid. The liquid-phase system holds more nitrogen and thus\nrequires less maintenance. However, there is always a chance that some liquid\nwill enter improperly sealed vials which may explode when retrieved. For this\nreason ATCC strongly recommends storage in vapor-phase systems.\n\nVapor-phase systems create a vertical temperature gradient within the\ncontainer. The temperature in the liquid nitrogen at the bottom will be\n\u2013196\u00b0C, whereas the temperature at the top will vary depending upon the amount\nof liquid nitrogen at the bottom as well as the amount of time the container\nis opened. To ensure safe storage of cells, be sure to keep enough liquid\nnitrogen in the container so that the temperature at the top is \u2013130\u00b0C or\ncolder. All storage systems should be equipped with temperature alarms.\n\n#### Cryopreservation procedure\n\nThe procedure below will work for most cell cultures and should be modified as\nneeded. Freeze medium formulations for all ATCC cell lines are provided on the\nProduct Sheet. Harvest cells in exponential growth.\n\n  1. Check your cell culture for contamination from bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and viruses (see Contamination) immediately before cryopreservation. In most cases, the results of the contamination screen will be available some time after the cultures are cryopreserved (10 to 14 days). If contamination is confirmed, then destroy the frozen material. \n  2. Prepare a freeze medium consisting of complete growth medium and 5% DMSO (ATCC 4-X). Do not add undiluted DMSO to a cell suspension as dissolution of DMSO in aqueous solutions gives off heat. \n  3. Collect cells by gentle centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g) and resuspend them in the freeze medium at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 to 5 \u00d7 106 viable cells/mL. Continue to maintain the cells in culture until the viability of the recovered cells is confirmed (see Step 9). \n  4. Label the appropriate number of vials with the name of the cell line and the date. Then add 1 to 1.8 mL of the cell suspension to each of the vials (depending upon the volume of the vial) and seal. \n  5. Allow cells to equilibrate in the freeze medium at room temperature for a minimum of 15 minutes but no longer than 40. This time is usually taken up in dispensing aliquots of the cell suspension into the vials. After 40 minutes, cell viability may decline due to the DMSO. \n  6. Place the vials into a pre-cooled (4\u00b0C), controlled-rate freeze chamber and place the chamber in a mechanical freezer at \u201370\u00b0C (or colder) for at least 24 hours. Alternately, use a pre-cooled (4\u00b0C) programmable freezer unit set to cool the vials at \u20131\u00b0C per minute until a temperature below \u201340\u00b0C is achieved and then set to abruptly drop to \u2013130\u00b0C. \n  7. Quickly transfer the vials to a liquid nitrogen or \u2013130\u00b0C freezer. Frozen material will warm up at a rate of 10\u00b0C per minute and cells will deteriorate rapidly if warmed above \u201350\u00b0C. \n  8. Record the location and details of the freeze. \n  9. After 24 hours at \u2013130\u00b0C, remove one vial, restore the cells in culture medium, and determine their viability and sterility. \n\n#### Recovery of cryopreserved cells\n\nThe cell solution in the frozen vial needs to be warmed as rapidly as possible\nand then immediately combined with complete culture medium and seeded into an\nappropriate flask. While cells grown in monolayers can be recovered from\ncryopreservation in multiwell plates, the results are not as consistent as\nwith flasks.\n\nSome cell lines, such as hybridoma cultures, take several days before they\nfully recover from cryopreservation. Some hybridomas show low viability on the\nfirst day in culture and will generate cellular debris. Viability for most\ncells declines and reaches a nadir at 24 hours post-thaw. Most, if not all, of\nthis decline appears to be due to apoptosis (as opposed to necrosis) induced\nby the stress of the cryopreservation process.22 After this time point, cells\nbegin to recover and enter exponential growth.\n\n  1. Prepare a culture vessel (T-75 flask) so that it contains at least 10 mL of the appropriate culture medium equilibrated for temperature and pH. \n  2. Remove the vial from the liquid nitrogen freezer and thaw by gentle agitation in a 37\u00b0C water bath (or a bath set at the normal growth temperature for that cell line). Thaw rapidly until ice crystals have melted (approximately 2 minutes). \n  3. Remove the vial from the water bath and decontaminate it by dipping in or spraying with 70% ethanol. Follow strict aseptic conditions in a laminar flow tissue culture hood for all further manipulations. \n  4. Unscrew the top of the vial and transfer the contents to a sterile centrifuge tube containing 9 mL complete growth medium. Remove the cryoprotectant agent by gentle centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 \u00d7 g). Discard the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the soft pellet, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL or 2 mL of complete growth medium. Pipette gently to loosen the pellet and break apart clumps. (If the cells normally grow as clusters, avoid over-pipetting during resuspension.) Transfer the cell suspension into the medium in the culture vessel and mix thoroughly. \n  5. Examine the cultures after 24 hours and subculture as needed. \n\n### Contamination and biosafety\n\nContamination of cells in culture can arise from many sources including other\ncell lines, reagents, supplies such as pipettes and culture vessels, equipment\nsuch as tissue culture hoods and incubators, and laboratory personnel. While\nthe potential for contamination is constant, the risk can be reduced or\neliminated by proper precautions: using only reagents of known quality and\nsterility, quarantining new cell lines until they are tested to be free from\ncontamination, performing routine maintenance and cleaning of all equipment,\nand properly training cell culture personnel.\n\n#### Check for microbial contamination\n\nWhen most bacterial contamination occurs, it usually occurs within a few days\nand is typically obvious to the naked eye. Distinct changes to the medium such\nas turbidity, presence of particles visible in suspension, and a rapid decline\nin pH (yellow color, indicating acidity) are all indicators of bacterial\ncontamination. Fastidious bacteria species that grow very slowly can be\ndifficult to detect.\n\nFungal contaminants may or may not cause a change in the pH of the medium and\ncan be distinguished from bacteria by checking for the presence of filamentous\nstructures in the suspension. Yeast cells are larger than bacteria, but may\nnot appreciably change the pH of the medium, and will appear as separate round\nor ovoid particles. Microbacterial media which can be used to test for\nbacterial and fungal contamination include blood agar, thioglycollate broth,\ntryptic soy broth, BHI broth, Sabouraud broth, YM broth, and nutrient broth\nwith 2% yeast extract.23 However, some microbial contamination is not\napparent. For example, the use of antibiotics can suppress bacterial growth\nand thus mask contamination. Some viral infections do not alter the morphology\nof the cells, and detection of mycoplasma contamination requires specific\nassays.\n\n#### Mycoplasma contamination\n\nCell lines are screened for mycoplasma contamination by direct (agarose and\nbroth culture) and indirect (Hoechst) methods.24,25 For example, the\nfluorochrome Hoechst DNA stain will bind to the DNA of mycoplasma and the\norganisms can be detected easily when examined using a microscope equipped\nwith appropriate fluorescence optics. The direct culture method requiring both\nbroth and agar will permit isolation of cultivable strains as apparent by\nappearance of characteristic mycoplasma colonies on the agar medium.\n\nBoth direct and indirect methods for detection of mycoplasma are used at ATCC\nseveral times while a cell line is expanded for the preparation of the token,\nseed and distribution stocks.\n\nMost cell culture laboratories have incorporated PCR-based mycoplasma testing,\nusing kits such as ATCC\u2019s Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC 30-1012K)\ninto their routine cell culture operations.\n\nCell cultures can be submitted to the ATCC Mycoplasma Testing Service. See the\nATCC Services section of the website for details.\n\n#### Treating for microbial contamination\n\nEliminating contamination from a cell line is time consuming and does not\nalways work. Discarding the culture and starting over is preferred. However,\nif the cells are unique and irreplaceable, one should first identify the\ncontaminant and select a suitable antibiotic for treatment. It is best to test\nthe contaminating microbe for its antibiotic sensitivity prior to treatment;\nthis allows for a shorter treatment time and limits exposure of the cell line\nto potentially damaging reagents.\n\nThe cells are cultured for 1 to 2 weeks in the presence of the antibiotic, and\nthen cultured without antibiotic for 1 to 2 months. At this point, the line\nshould be retested with a very sensitive test method to make sure that the\nculture is clean. Periodic retesting should be employed to make sure that the\ncontaminant does not reappear. Since antibiotics may be toxic to cells, a\nselected population that no longer exhibits qualities of the parental line may\nresult. It may be necessary to examine the cured culture to determine if it is\nsufficiently similar to the original line.\n\n#### Cellular cross-contamination\n\nCross-contamination of one cell line with another can sometimes lead to the\nreplacement of the original cell with the contaminant, particularly when the\ncontaminant grows faster than the original line. HeLa cells are perhaps the\nmost famous example of a cross-contaminating cell line overtaking and then\nmasquerading as the original.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many continuous lines were unknowingly cross-\ncontaminated with other cell lines including HeLa cells. In the 1970s and\n1980s, as many as one in three cell lines deposited in cell repositories were\nimposters.26 This cross-contamination was only uncovered with the development\nof suitable genetic markers beginning in 1967.27 Indeed, several \u201cunique\u201d cell\nlines in ATCC\u2019s collection turned out to be HeLa cells upon further study.\nDespite the confirmation of their HeLa cell origin, cytogenetic analysis\nsuggests that there are differences among these HeLa-derived cell lines.\nSeveral of them possess unique properties. However, these cell lines should\nnot be used as functional models of their claimed tissues of origin.\n\nMore recently, ATCC and other cell repositories have used DNA polymorphisms in\naddition to enzyme polymorphisms, HLA typing, and karyotyping to confirm the\nidentity of their cell lines. One of the most reliable methods to study DNA\npolymorphisms is the profiling of short tandem repeats (STR) by PCR\namplification followed by capillary electrophoresis.28 STR profiles for all\nATCC human cell lines are available on the website in the catalog\ndescriptions. (See: Figure 4)\n\n**Figure 4: STR profiles for two unrelated human cell lines.** Top: KU812E\n(ATCC CRL-2100). Bottom: MRC-5 (ATCC CCL-171). Amplicons were generated using\nPromega\u2019s PowerPlex platform, separated by capillary electrophoresis and\nanalyzed using GeneMapper software from Life Technologies.\n\nTest cell cultures on a regular basis to ensure the absence of contamination\nfrom both microorganisms as well as from other cell lines. If contamination is\nfound, discard the culture and start fresh with a new stock.\n\n#### Biosafety\n\nThe need for precautions when experimenting with cells in culture depends upon\nthe source and nature of the biological material, the experimental procedure,\nand the laboratory/containment conditions. Since every situation is different,\nthe risks need to be identified and appropriate precautions need to be taken\nbefore any work begins.\n\nMore information on risk assessment and precautions can be found in the Center\nfor Disease Control (CDC) publication _Biosafety in Microbiological and\nBiomedical Laboratories_ , (BMBL) 6th Edition.29 The text of this publication\nis available in its entirety online (https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html).\nInformation on agent risk assessment and a description of the four biosafety\nlevels can be found in this publication.\n\nATCC assigns a biosafety level (BSL) to each cell line for purposes of\npackaging for safe shipment. When a cell line is known to contain an etiologic\nagent, ATCC classification is at least comparable to the BSL assigned to the\nagent by the CDC and in some cases the ATCC designation is more restrictive.\nATCC follows federal biosafety guidelines and takes several factors into\nconsideration when assessing potential hazard.\n\n**Biosafety Level 1**\n\n  * Cell lines with animal origin not included under Biosafety Level 2 \n\n**Biosafety Level 2**\n\n  * Cell lines that harbor mycoplasma or any other BSL 2 agent (See: NOTE 7) \n  * Cell lines exposed to or transformed by a primate oncogenic virus \n  * Primate cell lines that contain viruses \n  * Cell lines carrying a part of certain viral genomes, even if whole virus is not released from the cell30\n\nAs the recipient of a cell line, take into account not only the nature of the\nmaterial but also the manipulations employed during its handling when\nassessing the potential laboratory risk. For example, procedures involving\nlarge volumes of cell lines that contain HIV or that include manipulation of\nHIV in high concentration should be conducted under BSL 3 conditions.29\n\n**NOTE 7  \nIt is not possible to screen cell lines for the presence of every agent**. For\nadded precaution, ATCC handles all cell lines under BSL 2 practices, even\nthose classified as BSL 1.

Glossary\n\nThe following glossary was originally published by the Tissue Culture\nAssociation Terminology Committee in 1990.31\n\n**Anchorage-dependent cells or cultures**. Cells, or cultures derived from\nthem, which will grow, survive, or maintain function only when attached to a\nsurface such as glass or plastic. The use of this term does not imply that the\ncells are normal or that they are not neoplastically transformed.\n\n**Aneuploid**. The situation in which the nucleus of a cell does not contain\nan exact multiple of the haploid number of chromosomes, one or more\nchromosomes being present in greater or lesser number than the rest. The\nchromosomes may or may not show rearrangements.\n\n**Aseptic technique**. Procedures used to prevent the introduction of fungi,\nbacteria, viruses, mycoplasma, or other microorganisms in cell, tissue, and\norgan cultures. Although these procedures are used to prevent microbial\ncontamination of cultures, they also prevent cross-contamination of cell\ncultures as well.\n\n**Attachment efficiency**. The percentage of cells plated (seeded, inoculated)\nwhich attach to the surface of the culture vessel within a specified period of\ntime. The conditions under which such a determination is made should always be\nstated.\n\n**Autocrine cell**. In animals, a cell which produces hormones, growth\nfactors, or other signaling substances for which it also expresses the\ncorresponding receptors. (See also endocrine and paracrine.)\n\n**Cell culture**. Term used to denote the maintenance or cultivation of cells\nin vitro including the culture of single cells. In cell cultures, the cells\nare no longer organized into tissues.\n\n**Cell generation time**. The interval between consecutive divisions of a\ncell. This interval can best be determined, at present, with the aid of\ncinephotomicrography. This term is not synonymous with population doubling\ntime.\n\n**Cell hybridization**. The fusion of two or more dissimilar cells leading to\nthe formation of a synkaryon.\n\n**Cell line.** A cell line arises from a primary culture at the time of the\nfirst successful subculture. The term implies that cultures from it consist of\nlineages of cells originally present in the primary culture. The terms finite\nor continuous are used as prefixes if the status of the culture is known. If\nnot, the term line will suffice. The term continuous line replaces the term\nestablished line. In any published description of a culture, one must make\nevery attempt to publish the characterization or history of the culture. If\nsuch has already been published, a reference to the original publication must\nbe made. In obtaining a culture from another laboratory, the proper\ndesignation of the culture, as originally named and described, must be\nmaintained and any deviations in cultivation from the original must be\nreported in any publication.\n\n**Cell strain**. A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a\ncell line by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or\nmarkers. In describing a cell strain, its specific features must be defined.\nThe terms finite or continuous are to be used as prefixes if the status of the\nculture is known. If not, the term strain will suffice. In any published\ndescription of a cell strain, one must make every attempt to publish the\ncharacterization or history of the strain. If such has already been published,\na reference to the original publication must be made. In obtaining a culture\nfrom another laboratory, the proper designation of the culture, as originally\nnamed and described, must be maintained and any deviations in cultivation from\nthe original must be reported in any publication.\n\n**Chemically defined medium**. A nutritive solution for culturing cells in\nwhich each component is specifiable and, ideally, is of known chemical\nstructure.\n\n**Clone**. In animal cell culture terminology, a population of cells derived\nfrom a single cell by mitoses. A clone is not necessarily homogeneous and\ntherefore the terms clone and cloned do not indicate homogeneity in a cell\npopulation, genetic or otherwise.\n\n**Cloning efficiency**. The percentage of cells plated (seeded, inoculated)\nthat form a clone. One must be certain that the colonies formed arose from\nsingle cells in order to properly use this term. (See colony forming\nefficiency.)\n\n**Colony forming efficiency**. The percentage of cells plated (seeded,\ninoculated) that form a colony.\n\n**Contact inhibition of locomotion**. A phenomenon characterizing certain\ncells in which two cells meet, locomotory activity diminishes and the forward\nmotion of one cell over the surface of the other is stopped.\n\n**Continuous cell culture**. A culture which is apparently capable of an\nunlimited number of population doublings, often referred to as an immortal\ncell culture. Such cells may or may not express the characteristics of in\nvitro neoplastic or malignant transformation. (See also immortalization.)\n\n**Crisis.** A stage of the in vitro transformation of cells. It is\ncharacterized by reduced proliferation of the culture, abnormal mitotic\nfigures, detachment of cells from the culture substrate, and the formation of\nmultinucleated or giant cells. During this massive cultural degeneration, a\nsmall number of colonies usually, but not always, survives and gives rise to a\nculture with an apparent unlimited in vitro lifespan. This process was first\ndescribed in human cells following infection with an oncogenic virus (SV40).\n(See also cell line, in vitro transformation, and in vitro senescence.)\n\n**Cryopreservation**. Ultra-low temperature storage of cells, tissues,\nembryos, or seeds. This storage is usually carried out using temperatures\nbelow \u2013100\u00b0C.\n\n**Density-dependent inhibition of growth**. Mitotic inhibition correlated with\nincreased cell density.\n\n**Differentiated**. Cells in culture that maintain all or much of the\nspecialized structure and function typical of the cell type in vivo.\n\n**Diploid**. The state of the cell in which all chromosomes, except sex\nchromosomes, are two in number and are structurally identical with those of\nthe species from which the culture was derived.\n\n**Electroporation**. Creation by means of an electrical current of transient\npores in the plasmalemma usually for the purpose of introducing exogenous\nmaterial, especially DNA, from the medium.\n\n**Embryo culture**. In vitro development or maintenance of isolated mature or\nimmature embryos.\n\n**Embryogenesis**. The process of embryo initiation and development.\n\n**Endocrine cell**. In animals, a cell which produces hormones, growth factors\nor other signaling substances for which the target cells, expressing the\ncorresponding receptors, are located at a distance. (See also autocrine or\nparacrine.)\n\n**Epithelial-like**. Resembling or characteristic of, or having the form or\nappearance of, epithelial cells. In order to define a cell as an epithelial\ncell, it must possess characteristics typical of epithelial cells. Often one\ncan be certain of the histologic origin and/or function of the cells placed\ninto culture and, under these conditions, one can be reasonably confident in\ndesignating the cells as epithelial. The individual reporting on such cells\nshould use as many parameters as possible in assigning this term to a culture.\nUntil a rigorous definition is possible, it is more correct to use the term\nepithelial-like.\n\n**Euploid**. The situation in which the nucleus of a cell contains exact\nmultiples of the haploid number of chromosomes.\n\n**Feeder layer.** A layer of cells (usually irradiated or mitomycin-C treated)\nthat are nondividing but metabolically active, upon which a fastidious cell\ntype is cultured.\n\n**Finite cell culture**. A culture which is capable of only a limited number\nof population doublings after which the culture ceases proliferation. (See in\nvitro senescence.)\n\n**Heterokaryon**. A cell possessing two or more genetically different nuclei\nin a common cytoplasm, usually derived as a result of cell-to-cell fusion.\n\n**Heteroploid**. A culture whose cells contain chromosome number other than\nthe diploid number. This is a term used only to describe a culture and is not\nused to describe individual cells. Thus, a heteroploid culture would be one\nwhich contains aneuploid cells.\n\n**Histiotypic**. The in vitro resemblance of cells in culture to a tissue in\nform, function, or both. For example, a suspension of fibroblast-like cells\nmay secrete a glycosaminoglycan-collagen matrix and the result is a structure\nresembling fibrous connective tissue, which is, therefore, histiotypic. This\nterm is not meant to be used along with culture. Thus, a tissue culture system\ndemonstrating form and function typical of the cells in vivo would be said to\nbe histiotypic.\n\n**Homokaryon**. A cell possessing two or more genetically identical nuclei in\na common cytoplasm, derived as a result of cell-to-cell fusion.\n\n**Hybridoma**. The cell which results from the fusion of an antibody-producing\ntumor cell (myeloma) and an antigenically stimulated normal plasma cell. Such\ncells are constructed because they produce a single antibody directed against\nthe antigen epitope which stimulated the plasma cell. This antibody is\nreferred to as a monoclonal antibody.\n\n**Immortalization**. The attainment by a cell culture, whether by perturbation\nor intrinsically, of the attributes of a continuous cell line. An immortalized\ncell is not necessarily one which is neoplastically or malignantly\ntransformed.\n\n**In vitro senescence**. The inability of a vertebrate cell culture to grow\nbeyond a finite number of population doublings. Neither invertebrate nor plant\ncell cultures exhibit this property.\n\n**In vitro transformation**. A heritable change occurring in cells in culture,\neither intrinsically or from treatment with chemical carcinogens, oncongenic\nviruses, irradiation, transfection with oncogenes, etc., which leads to the\nacquisition of altered morphological, antigenic, neoplastic, proliferative, or\nother properties. This expression is distinguished from in vitro neoplastic\ntransformation in that the alterations occurring in the cell population may\nnot always include the ability of the cells to produce tumors in appropriate\nhosts. The type of transformation should always be specified in any\ndescription.\n\n**Organ culture**. The maintenance or growth of organ primordia or the whole\nor parts of an organ in vitro in a way that may allow differentiation and\npreservation of the architecture and/or function.\n\n**Paracrine**. In animals, a cell which produces hormones, growth factors or\nother signaling substances for which the target cells, expressing the\ncorresponding receptors, are located in its vicinity, or in a group adjacent\nto it. (See also autocrine and endocrine.)\n\n**Passage**. The transfer or transplantation of cells, with or without\ndilution, from one culture vessel to another. It is understood that any time\ncells are transferred from one vessel to another, a certain portion of the\ncells may be lost, and therefore dilution of cells, whether deliberate or not,\nmay occur. This term is synonymous with subculture.\n\n**Passage number**. The number of times the cells in the culture have been\nsubcultured or passaged. In descriptions of this process, the ratio or\ndilution of the cells should be stated so that the relative cultural \u201cage\u201d can\nbe ascertained.\n\n**Plating efficiency**. This term originally encompassed the terms attachment\nefficiency, cloning efficiency, and colony forming efficiency; it is now\nbetter to use one or more of them in its place because plating is not\nsufficiently descriptive. (See attachment efficiency, cloning efficiency, and\ncolony forming efficiency.)\n\n**Population density**. The number of cells per unit area or volume of a\nculture vessel, or the number of cells per unit volume of medium in a\nsuspension culture.\n\n**Population doubling level**. The total number of population doublings of a\ncell line or strain since its initiation in vitro. This term is synonymous\nwith cell generation time.\n\n**Population doubling time**. The interval, calculated during the logarithmic\nphase of growth in which cells double in number; for example, 1.0 x 106 cells\nincrease to 2.0 x 106 cells. This term is not synonymous with cell generation\ntime.\n\n**Primary culture**. A culture started from cells, tissues, or organs taken\ndirectly from organisms. A primary culture may be regarded as such until it is\nsuccessfully subcultured for the first time. It then becomes a cell line.\n\n**Pseudodiploid**. The condition in which the number of chromosomes in a cell\nis diploid but, as a result of chromosomal rearrangements, the karyotype is\nabnormal and linkage relationships may be disrupted.\n\n**Saturation density**. The maximum cell number attainable, under specified\nculture conditions, in a culture vessel. This term is usually expressed as the\nnumber of cells per square centimeter in a monolayer culture or the number of\ncells per cubic centimeter in a suspension culture.\n\n**Suspension culture**. A type of culture which will grow and can be\nmaintained without attaching to a surface, such as glass or plastic.\n\n**Transfection**. The transfer, for the purpose of genomic integration, of\nforeign DNA into cells in culture. The traditional microbiological usage of\nthis term implied that the DNA being transferred was derived from a virus. The\ndefinition as stated here describes the general transfer of DNA irrespective\nof its source.\n\n**Undifferentiated**. With animal cells, this is the state wherein the cell in\nculture lacks the specialized structure and/or function of the cell type in\nvivo.\n\n### References\n\n  1. Hayflick and Moorhead PS. Exp.
