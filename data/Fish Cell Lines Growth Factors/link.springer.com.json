Here, we describe a\nmuscle-derived cell line initiated from the tail of a juvenile snapper which\nhas been designated CAtmus1PFR ( _Chrysophrys auratus,_ tail muscle, Plant &\nFood Research) _._ The cell line has been passaged over 100 times in 3 years\nand is considered immortal. Cells are reliant on serum supplementation for\nproliferation and exhibit a broad thermal profile comparable to the\neurythermic nature of _C. auratus_ in vivo. The impact of exogenous growth\nfactors, including insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II),\nbasic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta\n(TGF\u03b2), on cell morphology and proliferation was investigated. Insulin-like\ngrowth factors acted as mitogens and had minimal effect on cell morphology.\nTGF\u03b2 exposure resulted in CAtmus1PFR exhibiting a myofibroblast morphology\nbecoming enlarged with actin bundling. This differentiation was confirmed\nthrough the expression of smooth muscle actin ( _sma_ ), an increase in type 1\ncollagen ( _col1a_ ) expression, and a loss of motility. Expression of _col1a_\nand _sma_ was decreased when cells were exposed to bFGF, and no actin bundling\nwas observed. These data indicate that CAtmus1PFR may be myofibroblastic\nprecursor cells descending from mesenchymal progenitor cells present in the\ntail muscle myosepta.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  Development of a cell line from skeletal trunk muscle of the fish Labeo\nrohita\n\nArticle 01 June 2023\n\nMukunda Goswami, Nevil Pinto, \u2026 Reza Ovissipour\n\n###  Continuous fish muscle cell line with capacity for myogenic and\nadipogenic-like phenotypes\n\nArticle Open access 29 March 2023\n\nMichael K.

The species has economic\nsignificance in New Zealand, representing one of the largest capture fisheries\nin the country. In addition, snapper, or t\u0101mure, have cultural significance to\nthe indigenous people of New Zealand (M\u0101ori) as well as being a popular\nrecreational fishery (Parsons _et al._ 2014). These factors have made snapper\na prime candidate for aquaculture. A selective breeding programme to produce\nsnapper strains that are adapted to domestication is ongoing in New Zealand\n(Ashton _et al._ 2019; Wellenreuther _et al._ 2019). Despite the significance\nof this species, there are no cell lines derived from _C. auratus_ tissue,\nincluding muscle. As fish strains that exhibit more rapid muscle growth are\ndesirable for commercial purposes (Olesen _et al._ 2003; Sandoval-Castillo _et\nal._ 2022), availability of muscle-derived cell lines could assist aquaculture\nof snapper through fundamental understanding of muscle growth, development,\nand repair in vitro, but would also provide a platform for controlled analysis\nof single or multiple parameters at a time, e.g. temperature, salinity, and\nnutrients. These types of analyses can be challenging when dealing with live\norganisms in complex aquatic environments. A well-characterised cell line from\none species has the potential to act as a model system for other related\nspecies. There are also possible applications of cell lines beyond traditional\naquaculture in the field of cellular agriculture (Rubio _et al._ 2019).\n\nFish skeletal muscle is composed mainly of muscle fibres which form through\nrecruitment of new fibres (hyperplasia) or growth of existing fibres\n(hypertrophy) (Zimmerman and Lowery 1999; Ruparelia _et al._ 2020). The\ndimensions and distribution of fish muscle fibres, coupled with the extent of\nintramuscular fat, and the composition of intramuscular connective tissue are\nimportant factors which affect the final texture and quality of the fish flesh\n(Kiessling _et al._ 2006; Listrat _et al._ 2016). Despite this, description of\nspecific cell types beyond fibre-forming stem/satellite cells isolated from\nfish embryos or skeletal muscle (Gignac _et al._ 2014; Peng _et al._ 2016;\nSultan _et al._ 2021) is limited, particularly in comparison to mammalian\nsystems where vasculature-associated stem cells including mesoangioblasts and\npericytes have been described, in addition to interstitial cells such as\nfibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) cells and PW1-positive interstitial cells\n(PICs) (Cottle _et al._ 2017; Nassari _et al._ 2017; Rubenstein _et al._\n2020). The role of these and other progenitor cells of the myoseptum is\nessentially unexplored in fish muscle (Charvet _et al._ 2011; Bricard _et al._\n2014; Ruparelia _et al._ 2020).\n\nThe fish skeletal muscle invitrome (i.e. a grouping of cell lines around a\ntheme or category (Bols _et al._ 2017)) is extremely limited. Currently,\napproximately 26 skeletal muscle cell lines from 20 fish species have been\ndescribed in the scientific literature (Cellosaurus 2022). This number of\nspecies represents less than 0.04% of all known fish species (> 34,000)\n(www.fishbase.org). Of these cell lines, the majority are classified by cell\nmorphology, mainly as fibroblastic or epithelial, with few progressing\ncharacterisation to describe a specific cell type (Fernandez _et al._ 1993;\nZhao _et al._ 2003; Zhao and Lu 2006; Rougee _et al._ 2007; Lai _et al._\n2008). A key challenge in establishing well-characterised muscle (or any other\ntissue)-derived fish cell lines is the lack of resources such as validated,\nspecies-specific antibodies, detailed knowledge of cell lineages that exist in\nfish muscle, a lack of fundamental knowledge on the application of cell\nsorting technologies specifically for fish cells, and the huge breadth of\nspecies making transfer of technology and knowledge challenging (Rubio _et\nal._ 2019; Potter _et al._ 2020). In the absence of these resources, one way\nof determining a specific cell type is to investigate the genetic, physical,\nand biochemical responses of cells to various growth factors or cytokines, as\ntheir impacts on skeletal muscle development, homeostasis, and repair are\nreasonably well understood across species (Syverud _et al._ 2016, V\u00e9lez _et\nal._ 2017; Duran _et al._ 2022) . Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming\ngrowth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are some of the\nmost influential cytokines involved in these processes (Dayton and Hathaway\n1991; Syverud _et al._ 2016).\n\nFGFs have been shown to promote proliferation of activated myogenic stem\ncells, suppressing their terminal differentiation (Dayton and Hathaway 1991;\nFox and Swain 1993). In addition, FGFs have been shown to enhance the\nproliferation of fibroblasts and promote the formation of new blood vessels\n(Floss _et al._ 1997; Kastner _et al._ 2000). Myogenic stem cell\ndifferentiation is inhibited by TGF\u03b2 through the inhibition of myogenic\nregulators MyoD and myogenin (Liu _et al._ 2001). TGF\u03b2 regulates the phenotype\nand function of fibroblasts and plays a role in myofibroblast\ntransdifferentiation (Krummel _et al._ 1988). This process promotes expression\nof extracellular matrix and profibrotic genes such as type 1 collagen (\n_col1a_ ) (Ignotz and Massagu\u00e9 1986; Grande _et al._ 1997) and connective\ntissue growth factor ( _ctgf_ ) (Leask _et al._ 2009; Tsai _et al._ 2018). In\nsome situations, excessive TGF\u03b2-induced deposition of extracellular matrix\ncomponents can lead to fibrosis, a condition which severely impairs muscle\nfunction via reduced mobility and contractile function (Mann _et al._ 2011).\nFibrosis in fish heart, liver, and muscle has been reported in vivo (Arana _et\nal._ 2014; Keen _et al._ 2015; Lin _et al._ 2022). IGFs stimulate nutrient\nuptake, enhance myoblast proliferation, and increase protein synthesis across\na number of species (Negatu and Meier 1995; Rius-Francino _et al._ 2011;\nCastillo _et al._ 2004; Codina _et al._ 2008; D\u00edaz _et al._ 2009; Gabillard\n_et al._ 2010; Montserrat _et al._ 2012). There is also evidence that\nexogenous addition of IGF-I to primary myocytes derived from gilthead\nseabream, a closely related species to the Australasian snapper, resulted in\nincreased expression of myogenin, a transcriptional factor involved in\nmyogenesis, indicating that IGF may also play a role in the differentiation\nprocess (V\u00e9lez _et al._ 2014).\n\nHere we report on the first _Chrysophrys auratus\u2013_ derived cell line, among\nseveral others currently in development at Plant & Food Research (Nelson, New\nZealand). This cell line will be identified as _CAtmus1PFR_ ( ** _C_**\n_hrysophrys_ **_a_** _uratus_ **t** ail **mus** cle **1** **P** lant & **F**\nood **R** esearch\u2014species; tissue; institute affiliation). Our findings\nindicate that this cell line is a myofibroblastic progenitor cell derived from\nthe non-myogenic line of mesodermal progenitor cells.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Cell isolation and primary culture\n\nA single healthy juvenile snapper ( _Chrysophrys auratus_ ) bred at The New\nZealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited was euthanised with an\noverdose of anaesthetic (60 ppm AQUI-S, Lower Hut, New Zealand). The fish\nweighed 1.45 g and was 4.5 cm in length from nose to peduncle (Fig. 1 _A_).\nThe specimen was kept on ice for 30 min before processing for cell culture.\nThe fish was surface sterilised with 70% ethanol and approximately 1 cm3 of\nde-skinned muscle tissue was excised from the tail peduncle. The muscle\nsegment was washed extensively in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma\nAldrich, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 100 units mL\u22121 penicillin and 100 \u00b5g\nmL\u22121 streptomycin (1 \u00d7 P/S) (Sigma-Aldrich). Using sterile scalpel blades, the\ntissue was minced into small fragments which were further dissociated\nenzymatically by incubation with 1 mg mL\u22121 collagenase in HBSS at 18 \u00b0C for 4\nh. The dissociated tissue fragment was centrifuged at 95 \u00d7 _g_ for 5 min at\nroom temperature (Hettich 320R), after which the supernatant was removed and\nthe remaining cell pellet resuspended in 2 mL Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 (L-15, Gibco,\nGrand Island, NY) medium supplemented with 25% FBS (Gibco) and 1 \u00d7 P/S. The\nresuspended cells were added to a 25-cm2 flask (Falcon, Corning, NY) which was\nincubated in the dark, in ambient air and temperature (approximately 18 \u00b0C).\nTwenty-four hours later, media containing unattached cells and debris was\nremoved and fresh media added (L-15, 25% FBS, 1 \u00d7 P/S). After about 6 weeks in\nculture, the original T25 flask reached confluency, and was passaged to a\nfresh flask as indicated below, and the serum concentration was reduced to\n20%. Once the cells had been passaged four times, the serum concentration was\nreduced to 10%. Cells were monitored routinely using an inverted microscope\n(CKX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n **Figure 1.**\n\nEstablishment of CAtmus1PFR muscle-derived cell line from _Chrysophrys\nauratus._ ( _A_ ) Snapper from where CAtmus1PFR was derived.

L-15 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 \u00d7 P/S was used for\nroutine culture. On reaching confluency, cells were detached from culture\nvessels by exposure to 1 \u00d7 TrypLE Express (Gibco) for 5\u20136 min followed by\ncentrifugation at 95 \u00d7 _g_ for 5 min. Spent medium was removed, and the cells\nwere reseeded in fresh media at 0.133 mL media cm2- (i.e. 10 mL for a 75-cm2\nflask). For cryopreservation, cells were pelleted (95 \u00d7 _g_ for 5 min) and\nresuspended in 0.5 mL L-15 media (10% FBS). An equal volume of freezing media\n(L-15 with 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) was added for a final cell\nconcentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells mL\u22121 and a final DMSO concentration of 10%.\nCells were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C for a minimum of 48 h before long-term storage in\nthe vapour phase of liquid nitrogen.\n\n### Mycoplasma detection\n\nCells at passage 20, 28, and 48 h were cultured to confluency in the absence\nof antibiotics for 2 weeks. The presence of contaminating mycoplasma species\nwas monitored using the Lookout\u00ae Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n### DNA barcoding\n\nCell culture provenance was verified by DNA barcoding using universal non-\nspecific primers targeting conserved sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit\nI ( _COI_ ) and 16 s rRNA, and comparison to amplicons of the same genes of\ngDNA extracted from whole fish. DNA was isolated from CAtmus1PFR using a\nPurelink\u2122 Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. gDNA from a fin clip of _C. auratus_ was\nextracted using the method described previously by Ashton _et al._ (2019).\nBriefly, a fresh fin clip was placed into chilled 96% ethanol followed by\nheating to 80 \u00b0C for 5 min. The sample was stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until additional\nprocessing occurred. Approximately 20 mg of the fin clip was digested by\nincubation in extraction buffer (0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA\npH 8.0) with 2% SDS (final concentration) at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by rapid\ncooling on ice. The sample was digested with proteinase K (400 \u00b5g mL\u22121 final\nconcentration) for 1.5 h at 56 \u00b0C, after which the sample was centrifuged at\n13,680 \u00d7 _g_ for 15 min. Following treatment with 5 M NaCl and centrifugation,\nRNAse A (100 \u00b5g mL\u22121) was added to remove contaminating RNA. DNA was\nprecipitated with isopropanol overnight at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. Subsequent ethanol washes\nfollowed by air-drying yielded purified gDNA.\n\n_16  s rRNA_ and _COI_ amplifications from gDNA extracted from the fin clip\nand cell line were performed using BIOTAQ\u2122 DNA Polymerase (Meridian\nBioscience, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nForward and reverse primers (Table 1) were used to amplify approximately 750\nbp of _COI_ as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C (50\ns), 59 \u00b0C (50 s), and 72 \u00b0C (90 s), followed by 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. Approximately\n1500 bp of the 16 s rRNA gene (~ 1500 bp) was amplified in a similar fashion\nbut with a 54 \u00b0C annealing temperature. PCR products run on a 1% agarose gel\nwere extracted using a Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Machery Nagel,\nDuren, Germany) (Fig. S2). Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted amplicons was\ncarried out by Genetic Analysis Services (University of Otago, New Zealand).\nSequence reads from amplified COI and 16 s rRNA genes from CAtmus1PFR gDNA and\ngDNA extracted from the whole fish were aligned using BioEdit. Where errors\nbecame frequent, sequences were truncated. Chromatograms were scanned for\nmiscalls and corrected where deemed appropriate. Using the forward and reverse\namplification primers as previously, a consensus sequence of 622 bp resulted\nfor _COI_. For 16 s rRNA, a sequencing primer coupled with the previously used\nforward primer was used to generate a 694 bp consensus sequence.\n\n **Table 1. Primer sequences used for DNA barcoding**\n\nFull size table\n\n### Effects of FBS, basal media, and temperature on CAtmus1PFR cell growth\n\nCells (1 \u00d7 104) were cultured in 24-well plates containing 1 mL of standard\nculture media (L-15, 1 \u00d7 P/S, 10% FBS) and incubated at 18 \u00b0C for 24 h to\nallow cell attachment to occur. Following this period, cells were challenged\nwith varying FBS concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%) or different\nbasal media formulations (L-15, CO2 Independent Medium (CIM, Gibco), Medium\n199, Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salts (M199-HBSS, Gibco), MEM, Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salts\n(MEM-HBSS, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 \u00d7 P/S. At 2, 7, 10, and 14\ndays post inoculation, cells were detached in 1 \u00d7 TrypLE Express and counted\nusing a haemocytometer. The impact of temperature on CAtmus1PFR cells was\nexamined by seeding each well of 24-well plates with 1 \u00d7 104 cells and\nincubating immediately at various temperatures (4 \u00b0C, 12 \u00b0C, 18 \u00b0C, 24 \u00b0C, 30\n\u00b0C, 32 \u00b0C). Cell number was determined as above. Data shown in Fig. 2\nrepresent data from three biological replicates carried out on different days.\nEach biological replicate had three technical replicates.\n\n **Figure 2.**\n\nProliferation of CAtmus1PFR under different parameters. The impact of ( _A_ )\ntemperature ( _B_ ) FBS and ( _C_ ) basal media on CAtmus1PFR was monitored\nvia direct cell counts over a 14-d period ( _n_ = 3 for all experiments).\n_Error bars_ = means \u00b1 standard deviation.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Impact of growth factors on cell growth\n\nPilot experiments confirmed the correlation between cell number and measured\ncell metabolic activity through use of an MTT assay\n(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide, Invitrogen;\ndata not shown), and so, this method was employed to monitor the impact of\nbasic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, human recombinant, Catalogue No.\nPHG0266, Thermo Fisher), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21, human\nrecombinant, Catalogue No. PHG9204, Thermo Fisher), insulin-like growth\nfactor-1 (IGF-I, human recombinant, Catalogue No. PHG0071, Thermo Fisher), and\ninsulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-II, human recombinant, Catalogue No.\nPHG0084, Thermo Fisher) on cell proliferation.\n\nTwenty-four-well plates were seeded at 1 \u00d7 104 cells mL\u22121 in standard culture\nmedia (L-15, 10% FBS, 1 \u00d7 P/S) supplemented with 1 or 100 ng mL\u22121 of a single\ngrowth factor. All plates were incubated in the dark at 18 \u00b0C in ambient air.\nAt 1, 4, 7, and 10 days, an MTT assay was carried out as described previously.\nBriefly, wells were washed twice with 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,\nThermo Fisher), followed by addition of 0.4 mL serum-free media supplemented\nwith 0.1 mL MTT (5 mg mL\u22121). Cells were incubated for 70 min at room\ntemperature, after which 0.5 mL DMSO was added to each well. Cells were\nincubated with agitation for 10 min followed by gentle trituration. A 0.9 mL\nsample from each well was transferred to a cuvette where the absorbance was\nmeasured at 600 nm (Evolution 220 UV\u2013Visible Spectrophotometer, Thermo\nFisher). The spectrophotometer was blanked using serum-free L-15, MTT, and\nDMSO.\n\n### RNA extraction and qPCR\n\nCells were seeded at 1 \u00d7 104 cells mL\u22121 in media (L-15, 10% FBS, 1 \u00d7 P/S)\nsupplemented with 1 or 100 ng mL\u22121 growth factors (bFGF, IGF-I, IGF-II, or\nTGF\u03b21). After 4 days in culture, cells were washed twice in 1 mL dPBS and RNA\nwas extracted and combined from four wells for each condition using a GENEzol\nTriRNA Pure Kit (Geneaid, New Taipei City, Taiwan) as per the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendations. An on-column DNase treatment was carried out to remove\ngenomic DNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised from 500 ng of RNA using\nSuperscript VILO (Invitrogen) in a 20 \u00b5L reaction volume. qPCR primers were\ndesigned based on the gilthead seabream ( _Sparus aurata_ ) which is closely\nrelated to _C. auratus._ Database accession numbers of each target and\nreference genes are identified in Table 2. All primers were designed to span\nan exon-exon junction and should, therefore, not detect genomic DNA, sequences\nof which are shown in Table 2. Primer efficiencies were calculated to be\nbetween 91 and 98% (Table 2). Real-time PCR was performed using a Quant Studio\n6 Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher). Reactions consisted of 0.5 \u00b5L forward and\nreverse primers (10 \u00b5M), 8 \u00b5L TB Green\u00ae (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 6 \u00b5L UP\nH2O, and 1 \u00b5L cDNA for a total reaction volume of 16 \u00b5L.\n\n **Table 2. Database accession numbers  and primer sequences of each target\nand reference genes**\n\nFull size table\n\nElongation factor 1a ( _elfa_ ) was used as reference gene and the threshold\ncycle (CT) values were between 13 and 14. CT values for _col1A_ , _dcn_ ,\n_sma_ , and _vim_ were ~ 16, ~ 23, ~ 16, and ~ 23 in the control conditions\nrespectively. The relative fold change in gene expression was calculated using\nthe delta delta CT method (2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT) as described by Livak and Schmittgen\n(2001).\n\n### F-actin labelling\n\nCells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate in the\npresence or absence of 100 ng mL\u22121 bFGF or TGF\u03b2. After 4 days in culture under\nstandard conditions, wells were washed in dPBS and cells fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilised in\n0.4% Triton-X-100 in dPBS for 20 min followed by treatment with Rhodamine\nphalloidin (Invitrogen) in 0.1% BSA in dPBS for 1 h. Cells were washed and\nimaged using fluorescence microscopy (CKX53, Olympus ).\n\n### Migration assay\n\nCells (1.2 \u00d7 103 mL\u22121) suspended in L-15 growth medium were seeded in 0.07 mL\nvolume in each side of a two-well migration chamber (IBIDI, Bavaria, Germany).\nGrowth factors (bFGF or TGF\u03b2) were added to a final concentration of 1 or 100\nng mL\u22121. Chambers were incubated in ambient air and temperature, and the media\nrefreshed on day 4. On day 7, the migration chamber was removed, leaving a\n0.5-cm cell-free gap between cell populations. Debris was removed by washing\nin 1 mL dPBS. Fresh growth factor containing growth media was added, and the\nplates were imaged immediately using an inverted microscope. Subsequent images\nof the cell-free gap were recorded at 6 and 24 h post removal from the\nmigration chamber. The gap in a 1500 \u00d7 450 pixel (equivalent to ~ 3.5 mm \u00d7 ~ 1\nmm) section from each condition was measured using ImageJ software. Each\nmigration assay, of which there were two biological replicates, had triplicate\ntechnical replicates.\n\n### Animal handling\n\nAll research carried out in this study was reviewed and approved by the Animal\nEthics Committee of Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology in New Zealand\n(Application number AEC2019-PFR-01).\n\n## Results\n\n### CAtmus1PFR is a continuous cell line derived from _C. auratus_ tail\nskeletal muscle\n\nCollagenase treatment of a muscle segment derived from a juvenile _C. auratus_\n(Fig. 1 _A_) resulted in a preparation with a significant amount of debris.\nThis was not consistent with microbial contamination, but rather appeared to\nbe fragments of degraded muscle fibres (Fig. 1 _B_, _C_). By day 9, small\ncolonies of replicating cells with fibroblastic or spindle morphologies were\nobserved (Fig. 1 _B_). Many of these early cell types died off and were\nreplaced with other proliferative cells with varying morphologies (Fig. 1 _C_,\n_D_). After 1 month in culture, as the primary culture neared confluency, a\nheterogenous population of cells was evident with a number of different cell\nmorphologies (Fig. 1 _E_, _F_). Following continuous passage, a single cell\ntype emerged which had long spindle-like processes when culturing (Fig. 1\n_G_). However, on reaching confluency, a subpopulation of cells with a larger,\nmore rounded morphology developed. Cells were successfully cryopreserved and\nresuscitated in L-15 with 10% FBS and yielded approximately 80\u201390% cell\nviability. No morphological changes were observed following resuscitation. At\nthe time of publication, the cell line has been passaged 100 times over a 3-yr\nperiod. The line is assumed continuous through spontaneous immortalisation, as\nis common for finfish cell lines, and has been designated CAtmus1PFR (\n_Chrysophrys auratus_ , tail muscle, Plant and Food Research). The absence of\n_Mycoplasma_ species was confirmed through PCR (Fig. S1). The species origin\nwas verified as _Chrysophrys auratus_ by 100% homology between 16s rRNA and\nCOI gene sequence from CAtmus1PFR genomic DNA to gDNA extracted from a _C.\nauratus_ fin clip.\n\n### Temperature, serum concentration, and basal media formulation impact\nproliferation of CAtmus1PFR\n\nThe thermal tolerance of CAtmus1PFR to temperatures ranging from 4 to 32 \u00b0C\nwas investigated (Fig. 2 _A_). At hypothermic conditions (4 \u00b0C), the cells\ncompletely detached from the culture vessel after 2 d in culture. At 12 \u00b0C,\nthe cells proliferated slowly, and, by day 14, the final numbers were\napproximately half that of normothermic conditions (18 \u00b0C). At 32 \u00b0C\n(hyperthermic), the cells were unable to replicate, but remained attached to\nthe tissue culture vessel. Remaining cells were enlarged in size compared with\ncells cultured at normothermic conditions (18 \u00b0C). Temperatures ranging from\n18 to 30 \u00b0C provided conditions for comparable growth of CAtmus1PFR cells with\nno variation in cell morphology (Fig. 2 _A_).\n\nIn the absence of serum, the number of viable cells decreased over time; by\nday 14, a small number of cells remained with an elongated morphology (Fig. 2\n_B_ and S3). Decreasing FBS concentration from the standard 10 to 5% resulted\nin a lower proliferative rate. Conversely, increasing the serum concentration\nresulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell number over a 14-d period (Fig.\n2 _B_). In media supplemented with 25% FBS, the cell number after 2 wk in\nculture was more than double that observed with 10% FBS (Fig. 2 _B_). There\nwas no impact on cell morphology with FBS concentrations between 5 and 25%.\n\nCAtmus1PFR is routinely cultured in L-15 media which allows the cells to be\ncultured without the need for additional CO2. Alternative buffered media were\ninvestigated for their impact on proliferation of CAtmus1PFR cells (Fig. 2\n_C_). After 7 days in culture, proliferation of CAtmus1PFR in M199 was\nsignificantly greater than that observed in three other basal media\npreparations (L-15, CO2-independent medium [CIM], and MEM HBSS). By day 10,\nthe maximum cell number had been reached in M199 (~ 1.1 \u00d7 105), and this was\nmatched by CIM. Interestingly, cells culturing in L-15 and MEM reached maximal\nnumber at 7 d (~ 6 \u00d7 104), and did not show further growth even with fresh\nmedia replacements. Final cell numbers in MEM and L-15 were significantly\nlower than in CIM and M199.\n\n### Growth factors affect proliferation and morphology of CAtmus1PFR\n\nAt 1 ng mL\u22121, insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I, IGF-II) had no\nimpact on cell number as measured by MTT assay; however, at 100 ng mL\u22121, both\nIGF-I and IGF-II resulted in increased cell numbers (Fig. 3 _B_, _D_).\n\n **Figure 3.**\n\nImpact of growth factors on morphology and replication of CAtmus1PFR. ( _A_ )\nMicrographs showing pleiomorphic phenotype in control condition (L-15 media\nsupplemented with 10% FBS and 1 \u00d7 penicillin streptomycin) when confluent.\nImpact of IGF-I ( _B_ , _C_ ), IGF-II ( _D_ , _E_ ), TGF\u03b21 ( _E_ , _F_ ), and\nbFGF ( _G_ , _H_ ) on CAtmus1PFR proliferation and morphology at 1 and 100 ng\nmL\u22121 ( _n_ = 3). _Error bars_ = means \u00b1 standard deviation. All _scale bars_\nare 100 \u00b5m.\n\nFull size image\n\nTGF\u03b21 had no impact on cell numbers, but had a significant impact on the cell\nmorphology (Fig. 3 _F_, _G_). The cell size increased and appeared to be\nsimilar to the subpopulation of cells observed under standard culture\nconditions (Fig. 3 _A_). bFGF had minimal impact on proliferation of\nCAtmus1PFR but maintained all the cells in a single morphology (Fig. 3 _H_,\n_I_) similar to those observed in the control condition. The large rounded\ncells, which formed in the control condition (Fig. 3 _A_), did not form in the\npresence of bFGF (Fig. 3 _I_).\n\n### CAtmus1PFR treated with TGF\u03b2 have myofibroblast properties\n\nThe change in morphology of CAtmus1PFR following treatment with TGF\u03b21 and bFGF\nsuggested differentiation of the cell. Previous data have demonstrated that\nTGF\u03b21 can result in the differentiation of precursor cells to myofibroblasts.\nThese differentiated cells exhibit changes in cell shape, modified\ncytoskeletal features including the formation of actin bundles, and increased\ndeposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. bFGF has been\nshown to have an opposing effect, causing downregulation of myofibroblastic\nfeatures and encouraging a more fibroblastic phenotype. We therefore sought to\ndetermine if CAtmus1PFR was a myofibroblast progenitor cell, and gave rise to\nmyofibroblasts following TGF\u03b2 treatment, and whether bFGF had an opposing\neffect on this process.\n\nMyofibroblasts are associated in vivo with enhanced deposition of collagen. In\nTGF\u03b21-treated cells, a 2.5- to threefold increase in expression of _col1a_\nmRNA at 1 and 100 ng mL\u22121, respectively, was observed (Fig. 4 _A_).\nConversely, exposing cells to 1 or 100 ng mL\u22121 bFGF resulted in a significant\ndecrease in expression. The expression of _decorin_ mRNA, from a gene encoding\na proteoglycan extracellular matrix (ECM) component, was also increased in the\npresence of TGF\u03b21 and decreased where the cells were cultured with bFGF (Fig.\n4 _B_).\n\n **Figure 4.**\n\nImpact of growth factors on expression of genes associated with extracellular\nmatrix components.

Under standard culture conditions (no growth factors), large\ncells with actin bundling and smaller cells without bundling were evident\nafter 7 d in culture (Fig. 5 _B_). In the presence of bFGF, no actin bundling\nwas observed in any of the cells and the size and morphology remained\nunchanged (Fig. 5 _C_, _D_). In the presence of TGF\u03b2, cells exhibited\nsignificant actin bundling and large cell size by 4 d in culture (Fig. 5 _E_).\nBy day 7, the cells formed a mesh of cells with significant actin bundling\n(Fig. 5 _F_). An additional cytoskeletal marker, the intermediate filament\nprotein, vimentin, which is known to be expressed by myofibroblasts, was also\nupregulated following TGF\u03b21 treatment of CAtmus1PFR cells and downregulated in\nthe presence of bFGF, although the changes were not statistically significant\n(Fig. 5 _G_).\n\n **Figure 5.**\n\nEffects of growth factors on the cytoskeletal structure of CAtmus1PFR cells.\nCells 4 and 7 d in culture under standard conditions ( _A_ , _B_ ), or in the\npresence of 100 ng mL\u22121 bFGF ( _C_ , _D_ ) or TGF\u03b21 ( _E_ , _F_ ).

All _scale bars_ are 100 \u00b5m.\n\nFull size image\n\nExpression of smooth muscle actin (SMA) is generally indicative of\nmyofibroblast differentiation, and, when exposed to TGF\u03b21, expression of this\ngene increases in CAtmus1PFR (Fig. 6 _A_). A large variation in this increased\nexpression was observed across biological replicates (changes between 2- and\neightfold). It is plausible that the status of the seeding culture plays an\nimportant role in the expression profile of _sma_ , as cultures which have a\nproportion of cells already differentiated to myofibroblasts may result in an\nincreased expression of sma in the cell population. Conversely, bFGF-treated\ncells decrease expression of _sma_ mRNA (Fig. 6 _A_). SMA protein has\npreviously been shown to be involved with reducing the migratory capabilities\nof cells. To further investigate the migratory capabilities of growth\nfactor\u2013treated cells, a wound-migration assay was carried out. Mobility of\ncells treated with TGF\u03b21 was almost completely abolished at 100 ng mL\u22121, and\nwas somewhat retarded at 1 ng mL\u22121 (Fig. 6 _C_, _D_). Untreated and cells\ntreated with bFGF migrated into and closed the gap within 24\u201336 h (Fig. 6 _C_,\n_D_).\n\n **Figure 6.**\n\nEffects of growth factors on expression of smooth muscle actin ( _sma_ ) and\non cell migration.

This is the first reported cell line for _C.\nauratus_ , and it joins 26 other cell lines derived from fish skeletal muscle\nreported in the scientific literature. Of the previously reported lines, the\nmajority are described as being fibroblastic according to their morphology. In\nmany cases, these have been developed as in vitro systems for monitoring and\ncontrol of infectious disease in aquaculture (Middlebrooks _et al._ 1981; Zhao\n_et al._ 2003; Zhao and Lu 2006; Lai _et al._ 2008; Wang _et al._ 2020).\nDespite the emphasis on fibroblasts, skeletal muscle is a complex environment\nwith many cell types, each playing an important role in the development,\nrepair, and homeostasis of muscle tissue (Joe _et al._ 2010; Uezumi _et al._\n2011; Heredia _et al._ 2013; Giordani _et al._ 2019). Additionally, the ECM\nsupporting these cells provides both the physical and biochemical environments\nin which these cells reside (Csapo _et al._ 2020). Satellite cells, long\nconsidered muscle progenitor cells, are abundant in fish (Johnston 2006;\nRuparelia _et al._ 2020), and have been shown to undergo dichotomic\ndifferentiation into myoblastic and non-myoblastic lineages (Shefer _et al._\n2004). The myoblastic lineage leads to myogenic development, whereas the\nalternative leads to a mesenchymal pathway giving rise to cells which reside\nin the connective tissue of muscle. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells\ndistinct from satellite cells have also been described to occur in skeletal\nmuscle tissues. Work is ongoing to determine the specific stem cell origins\nthat has given rise to CAtmus1PFR.\n\nFish cell lines have been described as having a proliferation zone with an\noptimum temperature where cells replicate more rapidly (Bols _et al._ 1992).\nIn the case of CAtmus1PFR, there was a broad optimal temperature where the\ncells had a similar proliferation capacity (between 18 and 30 \u00b0C). This is in\ncomparison to a number of other cell lines where a single temperature is\nidentified as being optimal. A number of rainbow trout cell lines (RTE, RTE-2,\nRTG-2, RTH-149, and RTT) share an optimal temperature of 20 \u00b0C, with decreased\nproliferation at 5 \u00b0C above or below this temperature (Bols _et al._ 1992).\nThe broad temperature tolerance of CAtmus1PFR may be due to the eurythermal\nnature of snapper (Parsons _et al._ 2014), suggesting cell lines from this\nspecies represent the in vivo nature of the fish. It would be of interest to\ndetermine if the effect of temperature on the gene expression profile of\nCAtmus1PFR mirrors that observed in snapper in vivo, where pathways associated\nwith metabolism, cell regulation, and cell signalling were implicated\n(Wellenreuther _et al._ 2019).\n\nThe specific nutritional requirements of skeletal muscle-derived fish cell\nlines are undefined. Basal media formulations developed for mammalian cells\nsupplemented with mammalian serum as a source of growth factors, lipids, and\nadditional nutrients are routinely used (Bols and Lee 1994). Proliferation of\nmany muscle-derived fish cell lines is positively affected by increasing serum\nconcentrations (Zhao _et al._ 2003; Zhao and Lu 2006; Rougee _et al._ 2007;\nWang _et al._ 2020), and this is similar to that observed with CAtmus1PFR.\nInterestingly, different fish species have different tolerances to basal media\nformulations (Fernandez _et al._ 1993; Wang _et al._ 2003; Zhao and Lu 2006).\nHere we have demonstrated CAtmus1PFR is capable of enhanced replication in\nM199 and CIM media formulations; however, as the impact(s) these media had on\nthe biochemical and physical responses of cells was not determined, we\ncontinued to culture the cell line in the medium in which it was established\n(L-15). It is unclear at this stage whether media preferences are determined\nby the donor fish species, the donor tissue, or a specific cell type. A\ncomparison of requirements between these variables may provide additional\ninformation when it comes to understanding the development and growth of fish\nmuscle for applications in both traditional and cellular aquaculture (Rubio\n_et al._ 2019).\n\nIn fish skeletal muscle, mesenchymal progenitor cells are believed to give\nrise to myogenic and non-myogenic lineages. The myogenic lineage leads to the\nformation of skeletal muscle per se, while the non-myogenic lineage leads to\nmyofibroblast generation and is also proposed to form the resident\nfibroblasts, fibro/adipogenic progenitor cells, pericytes, and stem cells\n(Paylor _et al._ 2011). The impacts of various growth factors on fish myogenic\ncells have been reasonably understood, but their effects on the non-myogenic\nlineage less so. Here we provide evidence that CAtmus1PFR is a non-myogenic\nmesenchymal progenitor cell that is capable of differentiation to a\nmyofibroblast.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions, many components of the ECM, including\ntype 1 collagen, are produced by muscle-resident fibroblasts. In situations\nwhen muscle tissue becomes damaged, myofibroblasts are recruited. These\nspecialised cells increase deposition of collagen, which aids in the repair of\nmuscle tissue, but where the action of these cells is not resolved, a\nthickening or scarring of the tissue can occur (fibrosis). Decorin, another\ncomponent of the ECM, prevents the formation of fibrosis by binding to TGF\u03b2,\nyet there is evidence that myofibroblasts express full-length biologically\nactive decorin, which essentially contradicts the role myofibroblasts play in\nthe formation of fibrosis in vivo (Honda and Munakata 2004). The exact reason\nfor this is not clear but it has been proposed that decorin may play different\nroles as fibrosis progresses (Klingberg _et al._ 2013). It would be\ninteresting to monitor decorin expression over time in CAtmus1PFR and\ndetermine if expression of decorin changes.\n\nTGF\u03b2 is a known stimulant of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis\n(reviewed in Frangogiannis 2020). The differentiation process increases\nexpression of type 1 collagen ( _col1a_ ), and induces the expression of\nalpha-smooth muscle actin ( _sma_ ) expression in myofibroblasts (Desmouli\u00e8re\n_et al._ 1993), which may participate in the formation of stress fibres, cell\ncontractility, and cell spreading characterising the myofibroblasts phenotype.\nTGF\u03b21 also contributes to the upregulation of vimentin expression while\nblocking myogenesis (Wu _et al._ 2007) and reducing migration. CAtmus1PFR\nresponded similarly to TGF\u03b21, and these cells are thus prime for studying in\nvitro fibrosis events.\n\nIn vivo, increased deposition of collagen by cardiac myofibroblasts has been\nshown to play a role in the remodelling of the ECM of the heart in rainbow\ntrout in response to cold acclimation (Johnston and Gillis 2018). This\nreactive fibrosis leads to a stiffening of the heart, which provides support\nfor the increasing muscle mass of the fish. This has implications in\naquaculture, where fish strains are specifically bred for their ability to\nincrease muscle mass rapidly (Olesen _et al._ 2003). Indeed, perivertebral\nfibrosis, presumably due to the action of myofibroblasts, has been reported in\nfarmed Chinook salmon which has led to spinal deformities, thus reducing the\nvalue of this commercially important species. The exact cause of these\ndeformities is as yet unknown, but a number of factors have been proposed,\nincluding temperature, toxicities, trauma, and vitamin deficiencies (Munday\n_et al._ 2016). Indeed, the mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1, has been shown to cause\nliver fibrosis in trout (Arana _et al._ 2014), so it would be of interest to\ndetermine if this, and other toxins, in addition to compounding effects such\nas temperature stress, affected fibrosis in an in vitro model. Having a model\nof fibrosis is a useful tool, not only for understanding possible causes of\nfibrosis, but also for the development of prevention and rescue strategies,\nassuming the process is dynamic and, therefore, reversible. While\nmyofibroblast precursor cells have previously been isolated and cultured from\nheart tissue of rainbow trout (Johnston and Gillis 2018), this is the first\ntime a precursor cell capable of in vitro differentiation has been isolated\nfrom fish muscle. Beyond applications in traditional aquaculture, availability\nof this non-myogenic lineage from snapper tail muscle could also be relevant\nto the blossoming cellular aquaculture industry where the main focus has been\nin culturing myogenic cells, but as fish meat texture and structure are\nheavily influenced by the myoseptum and ECM, myofibroblasts and their\nprecursors may also prove essential for this technology.\n\n## References\n\n  * Arana S, Alves VAF, Sabino M, Tabata YA, Nonogaki S, Zaidan-Dagli ML, Hernandez-Blazquez FJ (2014) Immunohistochemical evidence for myofibroblast-like cells associated with liver injury induced by Aflatoxin B1 in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
