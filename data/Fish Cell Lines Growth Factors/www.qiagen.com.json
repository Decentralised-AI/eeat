Cell culture conditions\n\n## Cell culture conditions\n\n# Cell culture conditions\n\n###\n\nMedia and serum\n\nThe choice of cell culture medium is extremely important, and significantly\naffects the success of cell culture experiments. Different cell types have\nhighly specific growth requirements, and the most suitable medium for each\ncell type must be determined experimentally. Common basal media include Eagle\nminimal essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), RPMI\n1640, and Ham F10. These contain a mixture of amino acids, glucose, salts,\nvitamins, and other nutrients, and are available either as a powder or as a\nliquid from various commercial suppliers.\n\nBasal media are usually supplemented just before use with serum, L glutamine,\nand antibiotics and/or fungicides to give complete medium (also called growth\nmedium). Serum is a partially undefined material that contains growth and\nattachment factors, and may show considerable variation in the ability to\nsupport growth of particular cells. Fetal calf serum (FCS) is the most\nfrequently used serum, but for some applications, less expensive sera such as\nhorse or calf serum can be used. Different serum batches should be tested to\nfind the best one for each cell type. L-glutamine is an unstable amino acid\nthat, with time, converts to a form that cannot be used by cells, and should\nbe added to medium just before use. Antibiotics and fungicides can be used as\na supplement to aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination. The\nworking concentration of commonly used antibiotics and fungicides is provided\nin the tables _Commonly used antibiotics for animal cell culture_ and\n_Commonly used fungicides for animal cell culture_. Some cell types,\nparticularly primary cells, require additional supplements (e.g., collagen and\nfibronectin, hormones such as estrogen, and growth factors such as epidermal\ngrowth factor and nerve growth factor) to attach to the cell culture vessel\nand proliferate.\n\nMedia, serum, and supplements should be tested for sterility before use by\nincubation of a small aliquot at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. If microbial growth has\noccurred after this incubation, the medium or supplement should be discarded.\n\n###### Commonly used antibiotics for animal cell culture\n\nAntibiotic   | Working  \nconcentration  | Effective against  | Stability  \nat 37\u00b0C  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \nPenicillin  | 50\u2013100 U/ml  | Gram-positive bacteria  | 3 days  \n  \nStreptomycin  | 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/ml  | Gram-negative bacteria  | 5 days  \n  \nKanamycin | 100 \u00b5g/ml  | Gram-positive and  \ngram-negative bacteria;  \nmycoplasma  | 5 days  \n  \nGentamycin | 5\u201350 \u00b5g/ml  | Gram-positive and  \ngram-negative bacteria;  \nmycoplasma  | 5 days  \n  \n  \n\n###### Commonly used fungicides for animal cell culture\n\nAntibiotic  |  Working  \nconcentration   | Effective against  | Stability  \nat 37\u00b0C  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \nNystatin | 100 U/ml  | Yeasts and molds  | 3 days  \n  \n Amphotericin B  | 0.25\u20132.5 \u00b5g/ml  | Yeasts and molds  | 3 days  \n  \n  \n\n###\n\nIncubation conditions\n\nThe incubation conditions used to culture cells are also important. Cell\ncultures should be incubated in an incubator with a tightly regulated\ntemperature (e.g., a water-jacketed incubator) and CO2 concentration. Most\ncell lines grow at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with saturating humidity, but some cell\ntypes require incubation at lower temperatures and/or lower CO2\nconcentrations.\n\n###\n\nCell culture vessel\n\nThe choice of growth vessel can influence the growth of adherent cells.\nSterile, disposable dishes and flasks that have been treated to allow\nattachment of animal cells to the growing surface are available commercially.\n\n###\n\nCell banking\n\nFor some cell cultures, especially those that are valuable, it is common\npractice to maintain a two-tiered frozen cell bank: a master cell bank and a\nworking cell bank. The working cell bank comprises cells from one of the\nmaster bank samples, which have been grown for several passages before\nstorage. If future cell samples are needed, they are taken from the working\ncell bank. The master cell bank is used only when absolutely necessary. This\nensures that a stock of cells with a low passage number is maintained, and\navoids genetic variation within the cell culture.\n\n###\n\nCulture instability\n\nThe growth rate of cells that have been repeatedly subcultured may sometimes\nunexpectedly decrease, and the cytotoxicity of, for example, a transfection\nprocess may unexpectedly increase. This instability can result from variations\nin cell culture conditions, genomic variation, and selective overgrowth of\nconstituents of the cell population. We recommend using cells with a low\npassage number (<10 splitting cycles). To safeguard against instability in\ncontinuous cell lines, avoid senescence or transformation in finite cell\nlines, and maintain consistency in transfection experiments, we recommend\ncreating cell banks by freezing aliquots of cells to recall into culture if\nand when necessary.\n\nNext Essential protocols for animal cell culture\n\nPrevious Contamination\n\n  *     * Animal cell cultures\n\n      * Primary cell cultures\n      * Finite cell cultures\n      * Continuous cell lines\n  *     * Safety and handling considerations for animal cell culture\n\n      * Legislation and regulatory guidelines\n      * Safety considerations and biohazards\n      * Handling cell cultures\n      * Aseptic technique and minimization of aerosols\n      * Laminar flow hoods\n  *     * Contamination\n\n      * Microbial contamination\n      * Mycoplasmal infection \u2014 detection\n      * Mycoplasmal infection \u2014 eradication\n      * Cross-contamination of cell lines\n  *     * Cell culture conditions\n\n      * Media and serum\n      * Incubation conditions\n      * Cell culture vessel\n      * Cell banking\n      * Culture instability\n  *     * Essential protocols for animal cell culture\n\n      * Maintaining cell cultures\n      * Cell thawing\n      * Trypsinizing cells\n      * Passaging cells\n  *     * Counting cells\n\n      * Cell counting using a hemocytometer\n  *     * Freezing and viability staining of cells\n\n      * Freezing of cells\n      * Viability staining\n  *     * References\n\nCountry and Language\n\nAfghanistan  Albania  Algeria  American Samoa  Andorra  Angola  Anguilla\nAntarctica  Antigua and Barbuda  Argentina  Armenia  Aruba  Australia  Austria\nAzerbaijan  Bahamas  Bahrain  Bangladesh  Barbados  Belgium  Belize  Benin\nBermuda  Bhutan  Bolivia (Plurinational State of)  Bosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana  Bouvet Island  Brazil  British Indian Ocean Territory  British\nVirgin Islands  Brunei Darussalam (Brunei)  Bulgaria  Burkina Faso  Burundi\nCabo Verde  Cambodia  Cameroon  Canada  Cayman Islands  Central African\nRepublic  Chad  Chile  China  Christmas Island  Cocos (Keeling) Islands\nColombia  Comoros  Congo  Cook Islands  Costa Rica  Croatia  Cyprus  Czech\nRepublic  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Denmark  Djibouti  Dominica\nDominican Republic  Ecuador  Egypt  El Salvador  Equatorial Guinea  Eritrea\nEstonia  Ethiopia  Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  Faroe Islands  Federated\nStates of Micronesia  Fiji  Finland  France  French Guiana  French Polynesia\nFrench Southern Territories  Gabon  Gambia  Georgia  Germany  Ghana  Gibraltar\nGreece  Greenland  Grenada  Guadeloupe  Guam  Guatemala  Guinea  Guinea-Bissau\nGuyana  Haiti  Heard Island and McDonald Islands  Honduras  Hong Kong  Hungary\nIceland  India  Indonesia  Iraq  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Ivory Coast  Jamaica\nJapan  Jordan  Kazakhstan  Kenya  Kiribati  Kuwait  Kyrgyzstan  Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic  Latvia  Lebanon  Lesotho  Liberia  Libia  Liechtenstein\nLithuania  Luxembourg  Macao  Madagascar  Malawi  Malaysia  Maldives  Mali\nMalta  Marshall Islands  Martinique  Mauritania  Mauritius  Mayotte  Mexico\nMoldova  Monaco  Mongolia  Montserrat  Morocco  Mozambique  Myanmar (Burma)\nNamibia  Nauru  Nepal  Netherlands  Netherlands Antilles  New Caledonia  New\nZealand  Nicaragua  Niger  Nigeria  Niue  North Macedonia  Northern Mariana\nIslands  Norway  Oman  Pakistan  Palau  Panama  Papua New Guinea  Paraguay\nPeru  Philippines  Pitcairn Islands  Poland  Portugal  Puerto Rico  Qatar\nReunion  Romania  Rwanda  Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha  Saint\nKitts and Nevis  Saint Lucia  Saint Pierre and Miquelon  Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines  Samoa  San Marino  Sao Tome and Principe  Saudi Arabia  Senegal\nSerbia  Seychelles  Sierra Leone  Singapore  Slovakia  Slovenia  Solomon\nIslands  Somalia  South Africa  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\nSouth Korea  Spain  Sri Lanka  Sudan  Suriname  Svalbard and Jan Mayen\nSwaziland  Sweden  Switzerland  Taiwan  Tajikistan  Tanzania  Thailand  Togo\nTokelau  Tonga  TP  Trinidad and Tobago  Tunisia  Turkey  Turkmenistan  Turks\nand Caicos Islands  Tuvalu  U.S. Virgin Islands  Uganda  Ukraine  United Arab\nEmirates  United Kingdom  United States Minor Outlying Islands  United States\nof America  Uruguay  Uzbekistan  Vanuatu  Vatican City  Venezuela  Vietnam\nWallis and Futuna  Western Sahara  Yemen  Zambia  Zimbabwe\n\nSelect Language English  Chinese (Simplified, PRC)  French  German  Japanese\n(Japan)  Korean (Korea)  Spanish\n\nFollow Us\n\n  *  _icon_0065_instagram-s_\n  *  _icon_0064_facebook-s_\n  *  _icon_0340_cc_gen_x-s_\n  *  _icon_0077_youtube-s_\n  *  _icon_0066_linkedin-s_\n\nContact Us\n\n  *  _icon_0072_phone-s_\n  *  _icon_0063_envelope-s_\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nSample to Insight\n\n\u00a9 QIAGEN 2013\u201324.
