However, fish cell culture is relatively understudied in\ncomparison to mammalian cells. Here, we established and characterized a\ncontinuous Atlantic mackerel ( _Scomber scombrus_ ) skeletal muscle cell line\n(\u201cMack\u201d cells). The cells were isolated from muscle biopsies of fresh-caught\nfish, with separate isolations performed from two distinct fish. Mack1 cells\n(cells from the first isolation) were cultured for over a year and subcultured\nover 130 times. The cells proliferated at initial doubling times of 63.9 h (\u00b1\n19.1 SD). After a spontaneous immortalization crisis from passages 37\u201343, the\ncells proliferated at doubling times of 24.3 h (\u00b1 4.91 SD). A muscle phenotype\nwas confirmed through characterization of muscle stemness and differentiation\nvia paired-box protein 7 and myosin heavy chain immunostaining, respectively.\nAn adipocyte-like phenotype was also demonstrated for the cells through lipid\naccumulation, confirmed via Oil Red O staining and quantification of neutral\nlipids. New qPCR primers ( _HPRT_ , _PAX3B_ , _MYOD1_ , _MYOG_ , _TNNT3A_ ,\nand _PPARG_ ) were tailored to the mackerel genome and used to characterize\nmackerel cell genotypes. This work provides the first spontaneously\nimmortalized fish muscle cell line for research, ideally serving as a\nreference for subsequent investigation.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n###  Proteomic characterization of primary cultured myocytes in a fish model\nat different myogenesis stages\n\nArticle Open access 01 October 2019\n\nAntonio F.

In cellular agriculture, which is the production of animal-sourced\nfoods via cell culture, immortalized cells are essential for consistency\nduring large scale production. Most in vitro cell culture studies for future\nfoods have focused on livestock animals, such as beef cattle1,2,3,4. However,\ndue to concerns of overfishing and fish health in natural environments due to\nheavy metals, pesticides, and plastics, as well as the negative ecological\nimpact of aquaculture, _cellular aquaculture_ , or cell-cultivated fish, is an\nemerging yet understudied realm of cellular agriculture. Currently, fish\nsupport 15% of the global demand for animal protein; coupled with a growing\npopulation on the planet, the demand for fish is projected to rise further5.\nCurrent aquaculture and marine fish capture processes have significant\ndrawbacks in terms of food safety, depletion of fish stocks, and the\nenvironment. Overfishing is deleterious to marine ecosystems and is depleting\nnumerous fish species to the point of extinction6. In terms of food safety,\nfoodborne diseases, plastics accumulation, and heavy metal contamination are\nmajor issues, while environmental concerns connected to climate change are\ndamaging marine diversity7,8. Cellular aquaculture has the potential to\nalleviate fish sourcing concerns, with a focus on production efficiency,\nscaling, and controlled cultivation environments to address food security\nconcerns. However, to date there are no available fish skeletal muscle cell\nlines to produce cell-cultured fish meat, or to use as a model for research,\nlike immortalized C2C12 mouse myoblasts for mammalian muscle cell culture.\n\nNine fish cell lines, from _Acipenser transmontanus_ (white sturgeon), _Caranx\nmelampygus_ (bluefin trevally), _Lates calcarifer_ (barramundi), _Danio rerio_\n(zebrafish), _Carassius auratus_ (grass goldfish), _Channa striata_ (snakehead\nmurrel), _Labeo catla_ (Indian catla), and _Wallago attu_ (helicopter\ncatfish), have been isolated from fish muscle9,10; however, none of the cell\nlines are characterized as muscle cells, as they lack myogenic potential.\nWhile fish muscle cells from species such as _Danio rerio_ (zebrafish), _Salmo\nsalar_ (Atlantic salmon), _Carassius auratus_ (grass goldfish), and\n_Oncorhynchus mykiss_ (rainbow trout) have been isolated, their applicability\nto cellular aquaculture has been limited11,12,13,14. These limitations stem\nfrom some of these species not being commonly consumed (e.g., zebrafish,\ngoldfish), the cell population not demonstrating muscle function (e.g., the\naforementioned cell lines, goldfish), or their limited growth potential\n(salmon, trout) as the cells were not demonstrated in long-term culture. For\ncellular aquaculture, a cell line with applicability to food through\ndemonstration of myogenic or adipogenic functions in long-term culture would\nprovide a reference for research as well as applicability for food production\nprocesses. In particular, a cell line from a commonly consumed fish species\nhas direct benefits for potential commercialization, as consumers would likely\nfavor in vitro fish from a recognized source.\n\nAtlantic mackerel ( _Scomber scombrus_ ) is an understudied fish species, with\nfew in vivo research studies and no in vitro cell studies published. Mackerel\nis a popular fish for consumption, and the oils from this fish are desired for\nhealth benefits due to their high percentage of omega-3 fatty acids15.\nHowever, mackerel populations have significantly declined in recent years,\nwith the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Seafood Watch, a platform for identifying\nenvironmentally sustainable seafood, recommending avoiding consumption of the\nfish due to its depleted stocks and exploitative overfishing16. Additionally,\nin 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised against eating\nmackerel due to high levels of mercury17. As an alternative to fished\nmackerel, the isolation and propagation of mackerel cells (muscle, fat)\ntowards cell-cultivated mackerel tissue offers an option to address the above\nconcerns.\n\nThe objective of this work was to isolate and characterize mackerel muscle\ncells towards a continuous cell line via spontaneous immortalization. First,\nsince mackerel is wild-caught and confirmation of species identity is a high\npriority in the regulation of fish and their labeling18, we confirmed the\ncells\u2019 identity as _S. scombrus_ through PCR on cell genomic DNA and\nsubsequent Sanger sequencing. After establishment of a continuous culture,\npast a spontaneous immortalization crisis event, we confirmed myogenicity\nthrough immunocytochemistry for paired-box protein 7 (PAX7) in proliferating\ncells, a marker for muscle cell stemness, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) in\ndifferentiated cells. As mackerel is an oily fish, we also demonstrated the\ncells\u2019 ability for lipid accumulation towards adipogenic-like outcomes. We\ninvestigated cell culture optimization, determining optimal seeding and\ndifferentiation methods while screening various extracellular matrix (ECM)\nsurface coatings. Finally, we initiated the development of research tools,\novercoming difficulties due to the lack of annotations on the _S. scombrus_\ngenome and including the design of primers for future gene expression studies\nand research needs.\n\n## Results\n\n### PCR confirmation of _S. scombrus_ identity\n\nTo confirm the identity of the isolated cells as Atlantic mackerel, an adapted\nmethod from Aranishi19 was employed. PCR on cell genomic DNA was run with two\nsets of primers, fish universal 5S primers and _Scomber_ genus-specific Saba\nprimers (Fig. 1A). The amplification products matched the expected size of 486\nbase pairs (bp) and 311 bp for 5S and Saba reactions, respectively. To\ninvestigate the species specificity, PCR products were sequenced via Sanger\nsequencing. The sequencing results were then compared by alignment to four\nscombrid species, _S. colias_ (Atlantic chub mackerel), _S. scombrus_\n(Atlantic mackerel), _S. australasicus_ (Chub mackerel), and _S. japonicus_\n(Blue mackerel) (Fig. 1B). As _S. scombrus_ exhibited 97.7% sequence identity\nto the consensus mackerel sequence (the consensus sequence from alignment of\nall the PCR product sequences), the identity of the cells was confirmed as\nAtlantic mackerel. While _S. scombrus_ did exhibit slight deviations from\nAranishi\u2019s sequencing (e.g., nucleotide mismatch in position 129), the other\n_Scomber_ species exhibited large insertions or deletions when compared\nagainst the DNA sequence of the cells (Fig. 1C).\n\n **Figure 1**\n\nPCR confirmation of S. scombrus identity.

To establish a cell line without genetic modifications, the cell\nculture proceeded through a crisis of spontaneous immortalization\ntransformation, as previously described by Li et al.12. Li et al.\ncharacterized the spontaneous immortalization crisis by a large-scale\napoptosis/senescence, resulting in sporadic clusters of quiescent cells that\nthen grow out of quiescence to reach more confluent areas12. From passages\n37\u201343, the mackerel cells underwent a similar crisis, marked by increased\nincidence of senescent cell morphology with clusters of viable cells (Fig.\n2B). After the spontaneous immortalization crisis, there were notable\ndifferences between the mackerel cells before and after this process.\nMorphologically, the cells became shorter and less variable in morphology\n(Fig. 2A,C). These morphological changes were confirmed with measurements of\ncell diameters before and after the crisis; 18.3 \u00b5m (\u00b1 0.53 SD) and 16.8 \u00b5m (\u00b1\n0.17 SD), respectively (Fig. 2E). Importantly, cell doubling time also\ndecreased significantly after the crisis, from 63.9 h (\u00b1 19.1 SD) to 24.3 h (\u00b1\n4.91 SD) (Fig. 2D). During culture, the cells consistently tested negative for\nmycoplasma (Supplementary Fig. S2). Additionally, early passage Mack2 cells\n(i.e., cells from the second isolation), demonstrated slightly altered\nmorphology and similar growth rates to that of the post-crisis Mack1 cells,\nwith a doubling time of 22.9 h (\u00b1 3.99 SD) (Supplementary Figs. S3A,B).\n\n **Figure 2**\n\nSpontaneous immortalization crisis event of Mack1 cells. ( **A** \u2013 **C** ) The\nprogression of Mack1 cells through phase contrast imaging.

PAX7 is a\nspecific marker of satellite cells and is detected through nuclear\nstaining20,21. Cells before and after crisis stained positively for PAX7 (Fig.\n3A), and image analysis showed a high percentage of PAX7+ nuclei, with cells\nafter crisis nearing a pure satellite cell population (Fig. 3C). To confirm\nthe cells potential to differentiate, cell feeding was ceased at 100%\nconfluency, and, after 10 days of serum starvation, cells were immunostained\nfor myosin heavy chain (MHC) with MF-20 (Fig. 3B). MF-20 staining confirmed\ncell differentiation into muscle fibers, with similar muscle morphology before\nand after the crisis. Despite cells before crisis being larger in diameter,\nimage analysis showed no significant difference in muscle fiber diameter\nbefore and after the crisis (Fig. 3D). Mack2 cells were also tested for their\ndifferentiation potential and demonstrated functionality with muscle fiber\nformation and lipid accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S3C). In fact, Mack2\ncells demonstrated robust muscle fiber formation, as confirmed with M-F20\nstaining (Supplementary Fig. S4).\n\n **Figure 3**\n\nMyogenic potential and differentiation of Mack1 cells.

Fat is especially pronounced in\nmackerel, as it is often described as an oily fish22,23. Thus, to investigate\nthe potential for mackerel muscle cells to accumulate lipids, induction\ntowards an adipogenic-like phenotype was explored through media\nsupplementation. Specifically, medium was supplemented with a lipid mixture\nand PPARG agonists (dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and\ninsulin), as PPARG is the master regulator of adipogenic differentiation20.\nInclusion of the lipid mixture with the agonists promoted lipid accumulation,\nconfirmed through ORO staining and quantification of extracted ORO (Fig.\n4A,B).\n\n **Figure 4**\n\nLipid accumulation in Mack muscle cells.

(D) Fatty acid composition of adipogenic-\nlike mackerel cells, native Atlantic mackerel (adapted from22,23,25,26), and\ncod liver oil (adapted from27,28,29). The top 13 most prevalent fatty acids\nfrom the in vitro mackerel are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviation,\nn = 3.\n\nFull size image\n\nLipidomics was used to characterize the fatty acid profiles of adipogenic-like\ncells and compared against published data for native Atlantic mackerel and cod\nliver oil, which is in the lipid mixture of the adipogenic medium. Fatty acid\ncomposition was binned into saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated\nfatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to compare lipid\ncomposition (Fig. 4C). In comparison to native mackerel, cultured cells\ncontained relatively higher MUFA levels and lower SFA levels. In comparison to\ncod liver oil, the cultured cells contained lower levels of MUFAs. Specific\nfatty acid composition from the top 13 most prevalent fatty acids in the in\nvitro mackerel are exhibited in Fig. 4D. Of note, oleic (18:1) and linoleic\n(18:2) acids appear enriched in the in vitro samples, while docosahexaenoic\nacid (22:6) was lower (Fig. 4D). More specific investigation into the\ncomposition of the phospholipids, which constitute the cell membrane and are\nassociated with **t** aste, and triacylglycerides, which are the storage form\nof fat and constitute most of the lipids present, are presented in\nSupplementary Fig. S5.\n\n### Cell culture optimization\n\nTo understand the best practices for culturing mackerel cells, we explored\nseeding density, muscle differentiation regimes, and surface coatings. For\nseeding density, cells were seeded at 1000\u201310,000 cell/cm2 to determine\nminimum seeding density and cell density at confluency. While cells seeded at\n2000 cells/cm2 proliferated well to roughly 30,000 cells/cm2 after 5 days,\nthose at 1000 cells/cm2 did not proliferate well after 5 days, indicating a\nminimum seeding density between 1000 and 2000 cells/cm2 (Fig. 5A). The maximum\ncell density (i.e., the cell density at 100% confluency) was determined to be\n~ 150,000 cells/cm2, as by day 5 the cells seeded at densities of at least\n4000 cells/cm2 experienced contact inhibition and did not exceed ~ 150,000\ncells/cm2 (Fig. 5A).\n\n **Figure 5**\n\nCell culture optimization. ( **A** ) Comparative growth curves for varying\nseeding densities over days 1, 3, and 5.

For growth,\nlaminin-511-E8 demonstrated increased proliferation rates (Fig. 5B), while for\ndifferentiation, the ECM mimetics did not improve differentiation efficiency\nof muscle differentiation or adipogenic-like phenotype induction (Fig. 5C,D).\n\nOptimization for muscle differentiation involved investigation of\ndifferentiation regimes chosen based on previous literature approaches that\ndemonstrated efficacy in mammalian cell differentiation2,3,21. The regimes\ninvolved reduction of serum to 2% in the differentiation medium, addition of\ntransferrin, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and insulin (termed \u201creduced-\nserum+\u201d), inclusion of ERK inhibitor (ERKi), and supplementation with IGF-1.\nWhen compared against the control of cessation of feeding (termed \u201cserum\nstarvation\u201d), all of the tested regimes had significantly lower percentages of\nMHC+ cells (Fig. 5E).\n\n### Gene expression\n\nTo build a research toolkit for the mackerel muscle cell line, a gene\nexpression assay with RT-qPCR was developed. Due to the lack of an annotated\ngenome for _S. scombrus_ , a reference genome for southern bluefin tuna (\n_Thunnus maccoyii_ , NBCI RefSeq GCF_910596095.1) was originally used to\ndesign primers for the genes of interest: _HPRT_ (hypoxanthine\u2013guanine\nphosphoribosyltransferase, a housekeeping gene), _PAX3B_ (paired-box 3b),\n_MYOD1_ (myogenic differentiation 1), _MYOG_ (myogenin), _TNNT3A_ (troponin T\ntype 3a), and _PPARG_ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). The\n_T. maccoyii_ genome was chosen because it is a fully annotated genome with\ngenes of interest and because _T. maccoyii_ is closely related to _S.\nscombrus_30. After initial screening for primer efficacy and specificity by\nrunning PCR products on DNA agarose gels, optimization was needed, due to\neither a lack of PCR product at the expected size or non-specific binding\nleading to multiple PCR products. To better investigate _S. scombrus_\nsequences, an Atlantic mackerel transcriptome (NCBI SRX2255766) was\nsuccessfully aligned to the tuna genome, with 78% of reads uniquely mapped via\nthe STAR aligner31. Of note, the 78% read mapping falls within the 70\u201390%\nobserved when mapping human RNA Sequencing reads to a human reference\ngenome31. Later iterations of primer design then referenced the _S. scombrus_\nannotated sequences. After successful confirmation where PCR products were\nsingular and matched the expected size on agarose gels, the primer specificity\nwas further confirmed through melt curves and Sanger sequencing (data not\nshown). Using the successful primers (Supplementary Table S1), gene expression\nduring proliferation, muscle differentiation through serum starvation\n(cessation of feeding), muscle differentiation through serum reduction (2%\nFBS) with additives, and lipid accumulation was investigated (Fig. 6).\nInterestingly, the adipogenic-like cells generally followed trends similar to\nmuscle differentiation and did not exhibit increases in _PPARG_. _PAX3B_ is a\nmarker of satellite cell stemness, while _MYOD1_ , _MYOG_ , and _TNNT3A_ are\nall genes associated with muscle differentiation. Thus, the decrease of\n_PAX3B_ and increases of _MYOD1, MYOG,_ and _TNNT3A_ during differentiation\nwere expected.\n\n **Figure 6**\n\nRT-qPCR Gene Expression for PAX3B, MYOD, MYOG, TNNT3A, and PPARG.

However, the lack of fish muscle cell lines has\nhindered cultured meat research for fish, such as studies into serum-free\nmedia, 3D expansion options, and structured tissue formation. While most\ncellular agriculture research involves the use of bovine satellite cells due\nto their food and environmental relevance, traditional animal muscle cell and\ntissue in vitro studies have focused on the mouse myoblast C2C12 cell line due\nto availability32,33. The present study provides a new option for the field of\nfish cell and tissue culture, through the establishment of a mackerel skeletal\nmuscle cell line.\n\nThe Atlantic mackerel cell line Mack1 is stable, having progressed out of a\nspontaneous immortalization crisis event and proliferating indefinitely since\nthe crisis (Fig. 2). The spontaneous immortalization method of establishing a\ncell line is preferred over genetic modification methods, as genetically\nmodified organisms (GMOs) will face stricter regulation, especially in\nEurope34. As noted in Goswami et al _._ , confirmation of species\nidentification is critical to cell line authenticity and regulation35. While\nwe performed PCR analysis on 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) to confirm the cell\nidentity as _S. scombrus_ , alternative approaches could target commonly\nsequenced DNA barcodes, such as other mitochondrial genes like 16S rDNA,\ncytochrome oxidase I ( _cox1_ ), or cytochrome b ( _cytb_ )36. Mack1 is a\nhighly pure muscle cell line, confirmed through immunostaining for PAX7 and\nMHC for myogenic potential and differentiation, respectively (Fig. 3). Mack1\ncells also possess the ability to accumulate lipids, demonstrating potential\nfor both fat and muscle phenotypes (Fig. 4). Optimization of Mack1 cell\nculture and research tool development was then explored through seeding\ndensity and differentiation studies, as well as RT-qPCR assay development\n(Figs. 5, 6).\n\nHowever, further understanding and optimization of cell culture are needed.\nWhile the expansion of the cells resulted in doubling times of 24.3 h (\u00b1 4.91\nSD), serum-free medium without FBS is necessary to reduce costs and to address\nethical considerations and animal-free ingredients in cellular agriculture.\nThe growth medium for the mackerel cell lines, which was based off an\nisolation medium for the closely related southern bluefin tuna ( _Thunnus\nmaccoyii)_37, contains a high serum percentage of 20% FBS. Given difficulties\nin adaptation to serum-free conditions, future mackerel isolations could\nexplore using serum-free or low-serum growth media. Methods that work well\nwith mammalian cell culture are not interchangeable with fish cell culture, as\nevaluations with Beefy9 serum-free medium (data not shown)38 and ERK\ninhibition (Fig. 5B)2 were unsuccessful. To develop a serum-free medium for\nfish cell culture, media with mushroom extracts and insulin-like growth factor\n2 (IGF-2) have shown promise in goldfish and medaka ( _Oryzias latipes_ )\ncultures, respectively39,40. However, neither medium promoted proliferation of\nMack1 cells (data not shown). Additionally, while the Mack1 cells did not\ndemonstrate a reliance on an ECM mimetic for cultivation (Fig. 5B), the\nsurface coating screens should be revisited during serum-free media\ndevelopment, as the FBS includes proteins that likely adsorb onto tissue\nculture plastic and encourage cell adhesion.\n\nWhile demonstration of myogenic and adipogenic-like phenotypes underscore cell\nfunctionality, the continued development of research tools to understand\nbiological and molecular processes should accelerate progress towards enhanced\nfunctional utility for these cells. While the Mack cells stained positively\nfor PAX7 and MHC, staining with antibodies for MYOD and MYOG was unsuccessful\n(data not shown). The unsuccessful trials highlight the need for future\nresearch tool development, to both pose and answer questions regarding cell\nline function and development. For example, the RT-qPCR assay introduced\nquestions regarding temporal gene and protein expression patterns in muscle\ndifferentiation, while the lack of _PPARG_ gene expression in lipid\naccumulation indicated the adipogenic-like cells likely undergo phenotypic\nchanges rather than a proper transdifferentiation. For muscle differentiation,\ndespite a lower percentage of MHC+ nuclei, the reduced serum differentiation\nregime resulted in increased gene expression of _TNNT3A_ when compared to\nserum starvation conditions (Figs. 5B, 6). While the gene and protein in the\nassays are different, TNNT3A and MHC are interrelated, as the troponin T\nbridges myosin heads to tropomyosin in differentiated muscle41,42. The\napparent discrepancy between _TNNT3A_ gene expression and MHC protein\nexpression could indicate a temporal difference in protein and gene expression\nor a difference in troponin T to MHC ratios during stages of differentiation.\nWhile mackerel muscle differentiation regimes generally followed expected gene\nexpression patterns (i.e., a decrease in _PAX7_ and increases in _MYOD_ ,\n_MYOG_ , and _TNNT3A_ ), lipid accumulation unexpectedly followed similar\npatterns, without a change in _PPARG_ (Fig. 6). Previous studies with\ntransdifferentiated C2C12s also noted the lack of expression of _PPARG_ in\nadipocyte-like cells; instead, increases in adipocyte lipid binding protein (\n_ALBP_ ), cyclooxygenase-2 ( _COX2_ ), and fatty acid-activated receptor (\n_FAAR_ ) were observed43,44. Because the Mack1 cells are muscle cells, it is\nlikely that cell-to-cell signaling/contact initiated intercellular\ncommunication for muscle differentiation45. Nonetheless, the specific\nmechanism of lipid accumulation in the Mack muscle cells is elusive. When\nC2C12s were fed with fatty acids and thiazolidinediones, _MYOG_ expression was\nhalted, although for the Mack cells _MYOG_ expression increased during lipid\naccumulation44. Despite gaps in understanding the mechanisms of these\nphenotypic changes, observing increased lipid accumulation was promising as a\nfat analog for cultivated foods.\n\nLipid accumulation in adipogenic medium was significant in comparison to\ngrowth medium (Fig. 3B), allowing for investigation into the lipid profile via\nlipidomics (Fig. 3C,D and Fig. S4). Comparing lipid composition generated with\nthese cells to native mackerel is limited due to the large variation in native\nmackerel lipid content seasonally and geographically23. However, an\ninteresting observation was the relatively high levels of saturated fatty\nacids in the phospholipid fraction (Fig. S4C). A hypothesis is that since the\nfish cells are cultured at 27 \u00b0C, a temperature higher than that of the\nAtlantic Ocean where the fish was caught, the phospholipid bilayer of the\ncells may be adapted to higher saturation levels to maintain solidified\nstates. In vivo studies have found that fish from warmer climates generally\nhave higher saturated fat phospholipid fractions than fish from cold water\nclimates, with _T. bernacchii_ increasing saturated fat levels when acclimated\nto a warmer water temperature46,47.\n\nThe present work details the establishment and characterization of a fish\nmuscle cell line that could serve as a characterization framework for other\ncellular agriculture cell line developments. The successful isolation and\npropagation of the Mack cells were achieved only after multiple isolation\nfailures for different species and with different protocols. Some observations\nfrom the attempted isolations were the need for robust sterilization methods\nfor the tissue, varying efficacy of enzymatic agents (e.g., trypsin,\ncollagenase, Accumax) for different species, and the need for debris removal\nthrough pre-plate methods (i.e., allowing cells and debris adhesion to an\ninitial cell culture vessel and then moving the non-adherent material to a new\nvessel) and subsequent washes after cell adhesion. While we hypothesized\nfreshness and the time between the death of the fish and the cell isolation\nwould be key parameters in success, surprisingly, that was not the case for\nthe two mackerel isolations. The fish were transported as whole fish on ice,\nand the isolations were not performed until about 5 h _post-mortem_. Despite\nthe time between fish death and cell isolation, the two mackerel cell\nisolations were more successful in comparison to cell isolations from other\nspecies (salmon, zebrafish, tilapia, trout, tuna), both in terms of yield of\nisolated cells per gram of tissue and in growth rate of the cells after\nisolation.\n\nFor future research, removal of all animal components, notably FBS in the\ngrowth medium and cod liver oil in the adipogenic medium, will be key to the\nfuture utility of these cells in cellular agriculture. To replace the cod\nliver oil, plant-based alternatives including intralipid or purified\n\u03b3-linolenic acid from borage seed oil can be pursued48,49,50. For optimization\nof cell culture conditions and removal of animal components, further\nunderstanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms of the cells should\naccelerate further progress. However, since _S. scombrus_ and fish in general\nare relatively understudied from an in vitro cell culture perspective,\nunderstanding cell processes are more challenging due to the lack of suitable\nexperimental tools. In developing RT-qPCR, we circumvented the lack of an\nannotated genome by aligning a mackerel transcriptome with an annotated genome\nfrom southern bluefin tuna, a closely related species. This sequence\nsimilarity between the species was high30, and future studies on species\nwithout annotated genomes could also leverage phylogeny in determining\npotential reference genomes. While RT-qPCR is one step in developing research\ntools, omics techniques should provide important insight by gathering large\ndatasets to infer gene, metabolite, or protein functions. Transcriptomics and\nproteomics will inform sequences of genes and proteins specific to Atlantic\nmackerel, which could further inform the design of primers and antibodies to\nstudy the cells with more resolution. Optimization of cell characterization\nwill enhance cell culture and accelerate development of tissue cultures from\nthese cells. Ultimately, a proof-of-concept 3D tissue construct, with both\nmuscle and fat generation, will be invaluable in showcasing the potential\nvalue of the Mack cells for industrial applications.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Primary mackerel satellite cell isolation and maintenance\n\nIsolations were performed on two separate fish, and cells from the first and\nsecond isolations are referred to as Mack1 and Mack2, respectively. Primary\nmackerel satellite cells were isolated enzymatically using collagenase.\nBriefly, wild-caught, deceased Atlantic mackerel ( _S. scombrus_ ) was\nobtained from fishermen off the Atlantic coast, near Gloucester, MA, USA, and\nthen transported to the lab on ice. The isolations generally began ~ 5 h\n_post-mortem._ The whole fish was first dipped in 70% ethanol for 10 s before\nbeing transferred into the tissue culture hood. Then, ~ 5 g of epaxial white\nmuscle tissue was excised then sterilized in 70% ethanol and rinsed in\nDulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, ThermoFisher Scientific #14190144,\nWaltham, MA, USA). The muscle tissue was minced into a paste and digested in\nDPBS containing 0.1% collagenase, type II (Worthington Biochemical #LS004176,\nLakewood, NJ, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, with trituration every 15 min.\nThe digested tissue was strained through 100, 70, and 40 \u00b5m strainers. The\nstrained cell suspension was centrifuged at 300\u00d7 _g_ to pellet the cells and\nthen resuspended in 10 mL of growth medium, comprised of Leibovitz\u2019s L-15\nMedium (ThermoFisher Scientific #11415064) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS;\nThermoFisher Scientific #26140079), 1 ng/mL recombinant human fibroblast\ngrowth factor (FGF-basic 154 a.a., PeproTech #100-18B, Cranbury, NJ, USA), 20\nmM HEPES pH 7.4 (Sigma Aldrich #H4034, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1%\nAntibiotic\u2013Antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific #1540062), and 10 \u00b5g/mL\ngentamicin (Sigma Aldrich #G1397). The cells in growth medium were then\ncounted using a NucleoCounter NC-200\u2122 automated cell counter (Chemometec,\nAllerod, Denmark) and seeded at ~ 100,000 cells/cm2 into tissue culture-\ntreated flasks. After 48 h of incubation at 27 \u00b0C without CO2, the plated\nsuspensions were transferred to flasks coated with 0.25 ug/cm2 iMatrix\nrecombinant laminin-511-E8 (Iwai North America #N892021, San Carlos, CA, USA).\nThe cells were not disturbed for 5 days to allow for adhesion. The cells were\nthen fed until they reached ~ 70% confluency, about 10 days after the\nisolation. Cells were maintained by passaging at ~ 70% confluency and seeding\nbetween 2000\u20138000 cells/cm2 or stored by freezing in growth medium with 10%\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma Aldrich #D2650). During early passages, 0.25%\ntrypsin\u2013EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific #25200056) was used to liberate the\ncells from the surfaces. 0.05% trypsin\u2013EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific\n#25300054) was used after a spontaneous immortalization crisis event,\ncharacterized by high incidence of senescent cell morphology in the culture,\nat around passage 37 (P37).\n\n### PCR identification\n\nTo confirm the identity of the cells from _S. scombrus_ , genomic DNA from in\nvitro culture [Mack1 P4 (n = 2), Mack1 P55 (n = 1), and Mack2 P3 (n = 1)] was\npurified using GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kits (ThermoFisher Scientific\n#K0721). In an adapted method from Aranishi19, PCR was performed with Q5\u00ae\nHigh-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs (NEB) #M0492, Ipswich, MA,\nUSA), with primers designed to target fish universal 5S rDNA (5S primers) and\n_Scomber_ genus-specific sequences of the 5S rDNA (Saba primers). The 5S\nforward and reverse primers used were 5S21F (5\u2032-TACGC CCGAT CTCGT CCGAT C-3\u2032)\nand 5S21R (5\u2032-CAGGC TGGTA TGGCC GTAAG C-3\u2032), respectively. The Saba forward\nand reverse primers used were Saba-18F (5\u2032-GGGCG CTGTT GCTCC ATC-3\u2032) and\nSaba-20R (5\u2032- ATGCT GTGAC ACCAC TGACA-3). To confirm successful PCR, the\namplification products were run on a 2% agarose gel and imaged on the G:BOX\nChemi XR5 (Syngene, Bangalore, India). To confirm species identity, the 5S and\nSaba PCR products were purified using Monarch\u00ae PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (5 \u03bcg)\n(NEB, # T1030). The purified DNA sequence was then analyzed through Sanger\nsequencing (GENEWIZ from Azenta, South Plainfield, NJ), using the forward\nprimer for amplification. The sequences were aligned to known 5S rDNA\nsequences for _S. colias_ , _S. scombrus_ , _S. australasicus_ , and _S.\njaponicus_ (NCBI GenBank Accession Numbers AB245986.1, AB246033.1, AB246025.1,\nand AB246016.1, respectively) with Geneious Prime (Biomatters, Inc., San\nDiego, CA, USA) nucleotide alignment.\n\n### Doubling time and cell diameter measurements\n\nTo track doubling time during cell culture, the dates/times of subculture and\ntotal viable cell numbers, as reported by the NC-200 automated cell counter,\nwere recorded. The growth rate and doubling time were calculated using Eqs. 1\nand 2:\n\n$$growth\\;rate \\left( {{\\text{h}}^{ - 1} } \\right) = \\frac{{\\ln \\left(\n{\\frac{viable\\;cells\\;at\\;passaging}{{viable\\;cells\\;at\\;seeding}}}\n\\right)}}{{culture\\;time\\left( {\\text{h}} \\right)}}$$\n\n(1)\n\n$$doubling\\;time\\;(h) = \\frac{\\ln \\left( 2 \\right)}{{growth\\;rate\n({\\text{h}}^{ - 1} )}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nCell diameters were obtained with the NC-200 automated cell counter.\n\n### Immunoctyochemistry\n\nTo validate myogenic potential, proliferating mackerel satellite cells were\nstained for paired-box protein 7 (PAX7), a marker of satellite cell identity.\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher Scientific\n#AAJ61899AK) for 30 min, washed in DPBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST, Sigma\nAldrich #P1379), permeabilized for 10 min using 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma Aldrich\n#T8787), blocked for 30 min using 1\u00d7 blocking buffer (Abcam #ab1265875,\nCambridge, UK) in DPBS, and washed with PBST. Primary PAX7 antibody\n(ThermoFisher Scientific #PA5-68506) was diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 blocking buffer,\nadded to cells, and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then washed with\nPBST, blocked for 30 min using 1\u00d7 blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h with\nsecondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, #A-11072) and Phalloidin-iFluor\n488 Reagent (Abcam #ab176753), both diluted 1:1000 in 1\u00d7 blocking buffer.\nAfter washing with PBST, the cell nuclei were stained with 1 \u00b5g/mL\n4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, ThermoFisher Scientific #62248) in DPBS\nfor 15 min at room temperature. Imaging was performed with a fluorescent\nwidefield microscope (KEYENCE, BZ-X700, Osaka, Japan).\n\nTo verify myogenicity, cells were cultured to 90\u2013100% confluency in growth\nmedium, after which cell feeding was ceased (termed \u201cserum starvation\u201d).\nFollowing 10 days of differentiation, the cells were fixed, stained, and\nimaged as previously described, using primary antibodies for myosin heavy\nchain (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank #MF-20, Iowa City, IA, USA; 4\n\u00b5g/mL), appropriate secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher Scientific #A-11001,\n1:1000), Phalloidin, and DAPI.\n\n### Image analysis of immunostaining\n\nTo quantify the percentage of nuclei expressing either PAX7 or MHC, the\nBZ-X800 Analyzer software (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan) was used. Overlay images\nwith cell nuclei (DAPI) and the immunostained target of interest were analyzed\nusing the \u201cHybrid Cell Count\u201d software for single extraction of fluorescence\nimages. Results from the analysis were then run through a custom Python script\nto remove any replicate counts within the same nuclei. For the PAX7 expression\ncomparison over multiple passages, the samples were first blinded and then\npassed through the analysis.\n\nMuscle fiber diameter analysis was performed using ImageJ. First, the scale\nbar in the image was used to set the measuring scale in the program. The line\ntool was then used to outline the diameter of the muscle fiber that needed to\nbe measured. Then, the measuring command was used to record the muscle fiber\ndiameter. The measurements were taken randomly, with n = 20 for each image.\n\n### Lipid accumulation\n\nFor lipid accumulation towards an adipogenic-like phenotype, cells were grown\nto 100% confluency and then fed 3 times a week with adipogenic medium (growth\nmedium with 10 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Sigma Aldrich #I0516), 0.5 mM\n3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma Aldrich #I5879), 0.25 \u03bcM\ndexamethasone (Sigma Aldrich #D4902), and 10 \u03bcL/mL lipid mixture (Sigma\nAldrich #L5146)). To visualize neutral lipids after 7 and 14 days of lipid\naccumulation, cells were fixed then stained with Oil Red O (ORO, Sigma Aldrich\n#O0625) and imaged via fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, a 3 mg/mL ORO stock\nwas prepared by dissolving ORO powder in 100% 2-proponal (VWR #BDH2032-1GLP,\nRadnor, PA, USA). That stock solution was then diluted to a 1.8 mg/mL working\nsolution in UltraPure\u2122 Distilled Water (ThermoFisher #10977015), incubated at\nroom temperature for 5 min, and then filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe\nfilter. After fixation, the cells were incubated with ORO working solution for\n10 min, washed with water, and then imaged. To quantify lipid accumulation,\nORO was extracted from the cells with 2-propanol, and absorbance at 510 nm was\nmeasured on a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT,\nUSA).\n\n### Lipidomics\n\nCells accumulated lipids for 14 days as described above. The cells were\nharvested and the lipids extracted via methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, Alfa\nAesar #41839AK, Haverhill, MA, USA) extraction as previously described50,51.\nBriefly, cells were grown in 3\u00d7 T75 flasks, rinsed with DPBS, and harvested\nwith a cell scraper (Fisher Scientific #NC1890484, Waltham, MA, USA).\nSuspended cells were vortexed with methanol (ThermoFisher Scientific #BPA4544)\nbefore adding MTBE and incubating for 1 h. Distilled water was added, then\nsamples were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 _g_ for 5 min. The upper\norganic phase was removed, and MTBE extraction was repeated. Double-extracted\nMTBE phases were dried under liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C.\n\nUntargeted lipidomics profiling (n = 3) was performed via high-resolution\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific\nQExactive Plus/HF Orbitrap HR-LC-MS/MS) at the Mass Spectrometry Core at Beth\nIsrael Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts51. Data processing\nwas performed in Python (v 3.8.5). The code and preprocessed dataset are\navailable in GitHub at the following URL:\nhttps://github.com/mksaad28/Saad_et_al_Mack. Python\u2019s pandas (v 1.2.3) was\nused to organize the data for manipulation. The lipids were binned according\nto their classification (e.g., phospholipids, triglycerides). Within each\nclassification, the lipid peak areas of the associated fatty acids were summed\nto determine total fatty acid area, and the fatty acids were sorted as\nsaturated (SFAs), monounsaturated (MUFAs), or polyunsaturated (PUFAs) based on\ncomposition.\n\n### Cell growth at different seeding densities\n\nTo determine the minimum seeding density and maximum cell confluency of\nmackerel cells, the viability of mackerel cells was measured using the\nCyQUANT\u2122 Cell Proliferation Assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #C7026)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were seeded in 96-well\nplates at different seeding densities (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000,\n8000, and 10,000 cells/cm2) in triplicate for each time point and cultured at\n27 \u00b0C. The culture medium was replaced every other day. At each time point\n(days 1, 3, and 5), medium was aspirated, and the plate was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nAfter thawing and a 5-min incubation with CyQUANT\u2122 working solution,\nfluorescence was measured at an excitation of 480 nm and emission of 520 nm\nusing a Synergy H1 microplate reader. Cell number was calculated using a\nstandard curve of cells seeded at a known density.\n\n### Surface coatings\n\nTo assess ECM efficacy in optimizing cell growth, muscle differentiation, and\nadipogenic-like differentiation, different 2D surface coatings were studied.\nThe following proteins and concentrations were used: no coating control; pre-\ncoated collagen, type IV (Corning #354233, Corning, NY, USA) at 5 \u00b5g/cm2; pre-\ncoated fibronectin bovine protein (ThermoFisher Scientific #33010018) at 10\n\u00b5g/cm2; pre-coated gelatin (ATCC #PCS-999-027, Manassas, VA, USA) at 0.1\nmg/cm2; laminin-511-E8 at 0.25 \u00b5g/cm2, added to the media; and pre-coated\nvitronectin recombinant human protein (ThermoFisher Scientific #A14700) at 0.5\n\u00b5g/cm2.\n\nMack cells were seeded on the different surfaces at 6000 cells/cm2 in\nexperimental triplicate. The proliferation of mackerel cells was monitored at\n1-, 3-, and 5-days post-seeding using FluoReporter\u2122 Blue Fluorometric dsDNA\nQuantitation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #F2962) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. For FluoReporter\u2122, fluorescence readings were\nperformed on a Synergy H1 microplate reader using excitation and emission\nfilters centered at 360 and 460 nm, respectively. Mackerel muscle\ndifferentiation was encouraged with cessation of feeding (serum starvation)\nand evaluated for MHC expression with MF-20 (immunostaining), as described\nearlier. Mackerel adipogenic-like differentiation was performed using\nadipogenic medium and evaluated with ORO quantification, as described earlier.\n\n### Muscle differentiation method screen\n\nTo screen different muscle differentiation regimes, six different methods were\ntested: cessation of feeding (serum starvation); medium containing 2% FBS\n(reduced serum); a differentiation medium (reduced serum + additives) adapted\nfrom Messmer et al.3\u2014reduced serum with insulin (Sigma Aldrich #I0516),\n1-oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Fisher Scientific #NC9401387), and\ntransferrin (InVitria #777TRF029, Aurora, CO, USA); reduced serum medium with\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; Shenandoah Biotechnology #100-34,\nWarminster, PA, USA); reduced serum medium + additives with IGF-1; and a\nmedium with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor (ERKi,\nMilliPore Sigma #1049738-54-6, Burlington, MA, USA), adapted from Eigler et\nal.2 More details on the media used are provided in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nMack1 cells were seeded with laminin-511-E8 in experimental triplicate and,\nupon reaching 100% confluency, were fed with the different regimes listed\nabove. After 10 days in culture, cells were fixed, stained with DAPI and\nMF-20, and images analyzed for the percent of MHC+ nuclei, as described\nearlier.\n\n### RT-qPCR\n\nPrimers for RT-qPCR were designed using the National Center for Biotechnology\ninformation (NCBI) Primer-BLAST tool. Primers were designed for the following\nsouthern bluefin tuna ( _Thunnus maccoyii_ ) genes: hypoxanthine\u2013guanine\nphosphoribosyltransferase ( _HPRT_ , a housekeeping gene), paired box 3b (\n_PAX3B_ ), myogenic differentiation 1 ( _MYOD1_ ), myogenin ( _MYOG_ ),\n(troponin T type 3a ( _TNNT3A_ ), and peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor gamma ( _PPARG_ ). For subsequent iterations of primer design, a _S.\nscombrus_ transcriptome (NCBI SRX2255766) was aligned with a _T. maccoyii_\nannotated genome (NBCI RefSeq GCF_910596095.1) with STAR aligner (v.2.7.0a).\nPrimer designs were then manually altered to better match the _S. scombrus_\nsequences.\n\nFor RT-qPCR, experimental triplicate cultures of Mack1 cells were prepared for\nfour conditions: proliferation, muscle differentiation with serum starvation;\nmuscle differentiation with reduced serum + additives (serum reduction); and\nlipid accumulation (adipogenic-like). For RNA extraction, cell lysates were\nharvested using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen #74104, Germantown, MD, USA),\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentrations were\ndetermined by Nanadrop\u2122 2000 spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific\n#ND-2000) at 260 nm. After RNA concentrations were normalized to the\nconcentration of the least concentrated sample, RNA was reverse-transcribed to\ncDNA using the iScript\u2122 cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad #1708890, Hercules, CA,\nUSA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nTo screen for successful primers, PCR was performed on cDNA using Q5\u00ae High-\nFidelity 2X Master Mix, and PCR products run on 2% agarose gels for visual\nconfirmation of efficacy and specificity. After screening confirmation,\nRT\u2013qPCR was performed with technical triplicates for each experimental\nreplicate using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad #1725270)\nwith primer pairs shown in Supplementary Table S2. Using the cycle threshold\n(Ct) values, \u0394Ct was calculated for each sample and gene of interest by\nsubtracting the Ct of the housekeeping _HPRT_ gene for each sample. \u0394\u0394Ct was\nthen calculated by subtracting the proliferation \u0394Ct from the sample \u0394Ct for\neach gene. When gene expression was not detected for proliferation samples (as\nwas observed in some replicates of _TNNT3A_ ), the average of the run\u2019s other\nreplicates for that gene was used. Fold induction over proliferation was\ncalculated as 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct.\n\n### Mycoplasma testing\n\nCell cultures were monitored for the presence of mycoplasma contamination\nusing the MycoAlert\u00ae Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza #LT07-318, Basel,\nSwitzerland) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The MycoAlert\u00ae\nAssay is a selective biochemical test that evaluates mycoplasma enzymatic\nactivity by measuring conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP). Spent medium was collected following > 24-h incubation in\ncell culture then centrifuged at 200\u00d7 _g_ for 5 min, and the supernatant was\ntransferred into white-walled opaque bottom 96-well plate (Griener Bio-One\n#655083, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria). Luminescence was measured using a Synergy H1\nmicroplate reader microplate reader. Samples were incubated with MycoAlert\u2122\nReagent for 5 min, and luminescence was measured (Reading A). Samples were\nthen incubated with MycoAlert\u2122 Substrate for 10 min, and luminescence was\nmeasured again (Reading B). The luminescence ratio of Reading B/Reading A was\nused to determine the presence of mycoplasma contamination with ratio < 0.9\ninterpreted as negative for mycoplasma contamination. Samples were tested in\ntechnical triplicate, and assay performance was validated using negative and\npositive controls (MycoAlert\u2122 Assay Control Set, Lonza #LT07-518).\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (v9.3.1, San Diego,\nCA, USA). For comparing means between two samples, unpaired t-tests were\nperformed, as indicated in figure legends. For comparison of more than two\nsamples, either one-way or two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed,\nas indicated in figure legends, with multiple comparisons performed via\nTukey\u2019s honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test. _P_ values < 0.05\nwere treated as significant. All errors are given as \u00b1 standard deviation,\nunless otherwise indicated.
