It's a fact that cell cultures\ncan greatly benefit from the use of pure, high quality proteins.\n\n#### To help ensure our growth factors are of high quality, we've designed\nGibco growth factors with:\n\n  *  **High biological activity** \u2014more results with less protein\n  *  **High purity** \u2014minimized interference from proteins or other contaminants\n  *  **Proven compatibility** \u2014Gibco proteins bioassayed with Gibco media\n\nShop all bioactive proteins   Request bulk production\n\n##  Gibco recombinant growth factors for cell culture\n\n### FGF basic\n\nFibroblast Growth Factor basic, bFGF, FGF basic or FGF 2, belongs to a large\nFGF protein family involved in many aspects of development including cell\nproliferation, growth, and differentiation. FGF-basic is a critical component\nfor maintaining embryonic stem cells in culture in an undifferentiated state.\n\n### EGF\n\nEGF, Epidermal Growth Factor, acts a potent mitogenic factor that plays an\nimportant role in the growth, proliferation and various epidermal and\nepithelial tissues  _in vivo_  and  _in vitro_  and of some fibroblasts in\ncell culture. Dysregulation of EGF production has been associated with the\ngrowth and progression of certain cancers.\n\n### BDNF\n\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a used in the maintenance of motor\nneurons and the differentiation of both cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons.  \n  \n  \n\n### IL-2\n\nHuman Interleukin 2 (IL2) causes proliferation of T-cells and is a central\nregulator of immune responses. IL2 stimulates the growth and differentiation\nof B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, lymphocyte activated killer (LAK)\ncells, monocytes/macrophages and oligodendrocytes.\n\n### VEGF\n\nVascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (VEGF), is a part of the platelet-\nderived family of growth factors. VEGF is involved in endothelial cell\nproliferation, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. VEGF has also been shown to be\nchemotactic for monocytes and osteoblasts.\n\n### GM-CSF\n\nGranulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is involved in many\nbiological responses including the growth and development of granulocyte and\nmacrophage progenitor cells, stimulation and the initiation of differentiation\nof myeloblasts and monoblasts, and chemotaxis of eosinophils.  \n\nPeproTech recombinant proteins and GMP cytokines\n\nFor those who seek a consistent supply of recombinant cytokines throughout the\ndrug discovery and development journey, Gibco PeproTech cytokines and growth\nfactors are manufactured solely in-house to maintain quality and provide high\ncompatibility across the RUO-to-GMP spectrum.\n\nLearn more about PeproTech recombinant cytokines\n\n* * *\n\n###  Open the links below and learn more about growth factors\n\nGrowth factor validation and quality\n\n##  Growth factor validation and quality\n\n###  Function\n\n**Figure 1. High purity.  **SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant human\nRANTES (Cat. No. PHC1054) and mouse SCF (Cat. No. PMC2114).\n\n**Figure 2. Structural homogeneity.  **The SDS-PAGE gel was run on Human BMP-2\n(Cat. No. PHC7145) under reducing (lanes 2 and 3) and non-reducing (lanes 4\nand 5) conditions. Under non-reducing conditions, BMP-2 is seen as a dimer,\nconsistent with biologically active BMP-2.\n\n###  Activity\n\n**Figure 3. More bioactive protein due to exceptional refolding techniques.**\nProliferation of MO7e cells in response to SCF from Gibco and the competitor\n(Cat. No. PHC2115). As illustrated by the lower ED50, less Gibco SCF is\nrequired to yield a response.\n\n**Figure 4. Protease activity confirms protein functionality.** Enzymatic\nactivity of Kallikrein 4 (KLK4) was measured by its ability to cleave\nfluorogenic peptide substrate Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC. The end product is measured\nusing fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 nm and 460 nm,\nrespectively.\n\n**Figure 5. High bioactivity of FGF-basic.  **Proliferation of Balb/3T3 cells\nin response to FGF (Cat. No. PHG0024) is demonstrated. Gibco FGF-basic is more\nactive than the competitor\u2019s FGF-basic.\n\n**Figure 6. Calcium flux confirms expected biological response.**  Calcium\nflux activation was observed by stimulating Fura-2\u2013loaded rat PMNs with the\nGibco chemokine CINC-2\u03b2.\n\nGet the \u201cgrowth facts\u201d about growth factors\n\n##  Get the \u201cgrowth facts\u201d about growth factors\n\nTo help you get your desired cell culture results every time, we\u2019ve compiled a\nlist from experienced researchers of important facts about growth factors.\n\n####  **The growth facts**\n\n  1. Stanley Cohen of Vanderbilt University and Rita Levi-Montalcini of the Institute of Cell Biology of the CNR won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 for their 1962 discovery of the growth factors NGF & EGF.\n  2. The sequence of amino acids permits growth factors to be grouped by family, suggesting that they evolved from a single ancestral protein.\n  3. Since the protein sequences display high homology, Gibco growth factors may be used with cells from many species.\n  4. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control along with the WHO maintain reference standards for many growth factors. Gibco growth factors are calibrated according to these standards when available.\n  5. ED50 is reported as a range because many cell-based assays exhibit assay-to-assay variation that is independent of the inherent biological activity of the protein. The ED50 range is derived from multiple independent assays of a given lot.\n  6. The half max value (50%) of a biological response is equivalent to one unit (1 U) of activity.\n  7. Interferon, the first cytokine discovered, was identified by British virologist Alick Isaacs and the Swiss researcher Jean Lindenmann in 1957 during their studies on virus interference.\n  8. Growth factors, like most proteins, are more stable when stored in undiluted, concentrated form. They should not be repeatedly frozen and thawed.\n\nProduct literature\n\n##  Product literature\n\n  * Flyer: Gibco growth factors for neuronal research\n  * Flyer: Gibco growth factors for stem cell research\n\n**Growth Factor Supplementation for Specific Cells  \n** Find optimal conditions and concentrations of growth factors for particular\ncell types.  \nReference Chart\n\nResources\n\n**Cell Culture& Transfection Learning Center**  \nAccess cell culture and transfection educational resources for better\nexperiment planning and execution.\n\n **Media Formulation Tool**  \nFind the right Gibco media formulation for DMEM, DMEM/F-12, MEM, and RPMI-1640\nmedia.\n\n### Related products\n\n  * Cell culture media\n  * Cell culture plastics\n  * Cell culture FBS\n  * Cell culture reagents\n  * Cell culture instruments & equipment\n  * Transfection products\n\nSupport\n\n**Cell Culture & Transfection Support Center**  \nFind technical support recommendations for your cell culture and transfection\nworkflows, including tips for experimental setup and in-depth troubleshooting\nhelp.\n\n **Need technical support?** Contact our expert team for technical and\napplication support of Laboratory Products\n\nFor Research Use Only.
