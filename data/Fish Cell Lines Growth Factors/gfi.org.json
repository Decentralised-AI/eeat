differentiation. A variety of strategies can\nbe employed to adjust various factors that contribute to these properties,\nincluding optimizing the starting cell line, improving the composition of the\nproliferation medium, and exploring the possibility of transdifferentiating\neasy-to-grow cell lines like fibroblasts into myogenic and adipogenic\nlineages.\n\nProduction platform\n\n  * Cultivated\n\nSolution category\n\n  * Research\n\nValue chain segment\n\n  * Production\n  * R&D\n\nTechnology sector\n\n  * Cell line development\n  * Cell culture media\n\nRelevant actor\n\n  * Industry\n  * Academics\n  * Startups\n\n## Current challenge\n\nReports of continuous myogenic, adipogenic, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), and\nembryonic stem cell (ESC)-like lines from fish in academic literature are\nrelatively sparse, and their reported doubling times tend to be long compared\nto mammalian cell types. The table below shows that many fish cell lines have\ndoubling times of several days, whereas mammalian cells typically require only\napproximately one day. For example, the doubling time of the C2C12 mouse\nmyoblast line is approximately 20 hours. Long doubling times pose a major\nchallenge scaling up production of cultivated seafood to commercially-relevant\nlevels. Slow growth also encumbers lab-scale research efforts into cultivated\nseafood.\n\nCell line| Species| Cell type| Doubling time| Incubation temperature|\nReference  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n **Mack1**|  Atlantic mackerel, _Scomber scombrus_|  Myogenic| 64 hours for\nprimary cells, reduced to 24 hours following spontaneous immortalization| 27\n\u00b0C| Saad et al.

(2014)  \n **SAE**|  Spiny dogfish shark, _Squalus acanthias  _| MSC| 1 week| 18 \u00b0C|\nParton et al. (2007)  \n  \nIn addition to the challenges posed by slow cell growth, media formulations\nthat avoid using serum and other animal-derived components are necessary for\ncultivated seafood to become economically viable. Substantial progress has\nbeen made in cultivated terrestrial meat with formulations like Beefy-8 and\nBeefy-R. However, research on animal-free media formulations for fish cell\nculture still needs to catch up. Serum-free growth of medaka cells was\nachieved using IGF2. However, the growth rates under those conditions were\nslower than the serum-containing control, suggesting that IGF2 only partially\nsubstituted for serum. Current efforts to produce high-performance, serum-free\nmedia for fish cell culture are underway, including at Virginia Tech and\nDefined Bioscience, but additional research is needed. Even in the presence of\nserum, spontaneous differentiation is observed in many pluripotent fish cell\nlines (Chen et al. 2003a; Chen et al. 2003b; Parameswaran et al. 2007).\nPremature differentiation presents an additional challenge to large-scale cell\nproduction by depleting the pool of proliferative cells.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nResearchers may employ various strategies to achieve rapid and reliable\nproliferation of relevant cultivated seafood cell types. These may be broadly\ncategorized based on the production step they most closely align to:\n\nProduction step| Possible interventions  \n---|---  \n **Cell line development and optimization**|  Optimization of the source cells\nthemselves\u2014either by direct manipulation or by selecting for desirable\nphenotypes within  a heterogeneous cell population\u2014may help to produce cell\nlines with the desired characteristics.  \n **Optimization of culture media formulation and culture conditions for\nproliferation**|  Likely the most important set of tools available to\nresearchers attempting to improve proliferation rates and other metrics for\ncultivated seafood will be optimization of culture conditions, especially\nculture media formulations.  \n **Differentiation**|  By better understanding the differentiation potential\nof various fish cell types, additional starting cell types may be added to the\nmenu of possibilities. If easy-to-grow cells such as fibroblasts could be\neasily transdifferentiated, issues related to cell line development and media\noptimization may become much more straightforward.  \n  \n### **Cell line development**\n\nThe proliferation rate and efficiency will depend on both the cell line and\nthe culture conditions, both of which can be optimized for better performance.\nImproving cell line properties can be achieved by directly modifying the\ncells, taking advantage of natural variation to select for those with the\ndesired properties, or some combination of the two strategies. This may be as\nsimple as gradually reducing serum concentrations over several passages to\nselect for cells capable of tolerating such conditions (Rado\u0161evi\u0107 et al. 2016)\nor may be more complex. Cell line selection and optimization is enough of a\nchallenge that entire companies can specialize in just this one area, such as\nTriplebar Bio and CHO Plus.\n\n### **Media formulation and culture conditions**\n\nTo optimize culture conditions for rapid proliferation while maintaining the\ndesired differentiation capacity, reducing costs, and avoiding animal-derived\nmedia components, researchers and companies can employ various strategies.\nOptimization of media component concentrations in serum-free conditions can be\nsuccessfully carried out using both one-factor-at-a-time strategies (Kuo et\nal. 2020; Stout et al. 2021; Stout et al. 2022), Bayesian optimization\n(Cosenza et al. 2022), or design of experiments (Kolkmann et al. 2022; Cosenza\net al. 2021).\n\nTranscriptomics or proteomics can help identify which factors may be missing\nfrom a given media formulation. For example, primary porcine muscle stem cells\nwere observed to lose their differentiation capacity over several passages,\nundergo senescence, and express proteins associated with oxidative stress (Zhu\net al. 2022). This suggested that adding antioxidants to the culture media\nmight be effective. Indeed, the addition of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate\nincreased proliferation rates and expression of transcripts associated with\nmuscle stem cell phenotypes. Differentiation efficiencies were also increased\nrelative to control cells having undergone a similar number of doublings.\nOptimization efforts can also be informed using spent media analysis to\ndetermine which nutrients are depleted and which remain unused (O\u2019Neill et al.\n2022). This strategy may benefit optimization efforts focused on reducing\nmedia costs.\n\nIn addition, academic literature provides several candidate molecules and\npathways that may be worth adding or manipulating to increase proliferation\nand maintain a stem cell-like state (Bomkamp et al. 2022). These include\ninducing myostatin loss of function (Seiliez et al. 2012; Garikipati and\nRodgers 2012a; Garikipati and Rodgers 2012b)and adding IGF-2 (Jim\u00e9nez-Amilburu\net al. 2013; Rius-Francino et al. 2011), forskolin (Xu et al. 2013), or\nanthocyanidins (Villasante et al. 2016) for fish myogenic cells. Strategies to\ninhibit the transcriptional regulator Ripply1 or increase the expression of\nthe transcription factors Mesp-b or Tbx-6 may also be helpful in this context\n(Windner et al. 2015; Kinoshita et al. 2018). In fish adipogenic cells,\ninducing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (Ross et al. 2000; Liu et al.\n2018) or adding IGF-1, insulin, or somatotropin (Salmer\u00f3n et al. 2013; Wang et\nal. 2012) may be effective. However, it is essential to note that different\nspecies and cell lines may have different needs, and these strategies are\nunlikely to work in every case.\n\n### **Differentiation**\n\nWhile most of the available evidence suggests that the lineage relationships\namong fish cell types broadly mirror those discovered in mammals, the details\nof these relationships may differ. Whereas transdifferentiation of mammalian\ncells into muscle has traditionally been achieved through methods such as\ntransfection with MyoD or other muscle-specific genes, Tsuruwaka & Shimada\n(2022) found that fibroblasts isolated from filefish fins could be easily\ntransdifferentiated by manipulating culture conditions. For example, simply\nchanging the culture media from L-15 + 10% FBS to AIM V + 10% FBS or L-15 +\n10% SeaGrow produced muscle-like and fat-like states, respectively. Similarly,\nSaad et al. (2022) observed that treating myogenic cells from Atlantic\nmackerel with adipogenic medium (insulin, IBMX, DMX, and lipid mixture) led to\nrobust lipid accumulation. These findings tentatively suggest that the\nboundaries between certain cell types may be less distinct in fish than in\nmammals, and that certain fish cells may be easier to steer toward an\nadipogenic-like or myogenic-like phenotype without using traditional\ntransdifferentiation techniques. Understanding the nuances of these\nrelationships will allow researchers and companies to choose the best\nstrategies for cultivated fish production. However, it remains to be\ndetermined how widely applicable this phenomenon is and how such cells perform\nin the context of a food product.\n\n## Anticipated impact\n\nIn the short term, identifying more reliable conditions for cell proliferation\nwill mean that academic researchers and early-stage companies will be able to\nspend their time on downstream problems, such as the development of better\nscaffolds, bioprocess optimization, and end product characterization. In the\nlonger term, more rapidly proliferating and more efficient cells will allow a\ngiven amount of cultivated fish to be produced less expensively and with lower\nenvironmental impacts. Early techno-economic modeling efforts suggest that the\nmetabolic efficiency of the cell lines used for cultivated meat and seafood is\nlikely to be one of the biggest factors in determining the cost of production\n(Humbird 2021). Cell lines and media formulations that maintain high\nproliferation rates and appropriate differentiation capacity over many\npassages will allow for the production of large amounts of cultivated meat\nfrom a single biopsy.If transdifferentiation is a viable strategy for fish,\nthe issues of both cell line availability and culture conditions could become\nmuch less challenging without adding the additional regulatory burdens\nsometimes associated with genetic manipulation. Unlike myogenic, adipogenic,\nand pluripotent lines, fibroblast-like lines are available from a reasonably\nwide variety of fish species (see the Indian National Repository of Fish Cell\nLines). Fibroblasts are also relatively easy to work with compared to other\ncell types, meaning that less complex and costly media formulations may be\nrequired. Similar to advances in cell line development and media optimization,\nadvances in differentiation techniques that expand the possible menu of\nstarting cell types will make it easier to conduct basic research into various\nareas related to cultivated fish.\n\n### Related efforts\n\n  * Algae and tobacco plant researchers among winners of \u20ac400,000 prize to commercialise cultivated meat.\n  * Lowering the cost of growth factors\n  * Liu et al.
