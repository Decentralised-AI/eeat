We will produce the\nrecombinant proteins and add to leucocyte primary cultures as growth factors\nto allow their growth  _in vitro_. In addition, we will combine this treatment\nwith antigen stimulation, by using leucocytes derived from immunised fish. In\naddition to morphological studies, we will undertake molecular and functional\nanalysis to give a preliminary characterisation of the cell types that grow\nunder these conditions and determine their cytotoxic and phagocytic\nactivities. We will test whether the cell lines can be used to measure\nresponses to exogenous immunostimuli such as lipopolysaccride, polyI:C and\nrecombinant cytokines. We believe that the established cell lines will provide\na permanent platform for basic research of the fish immune system, thereby\nreducing the need to kill fish to harvest tissues. They will also help reduce\nfish suffering by allowing some testing of aquaculture drugs/reagents, and the\nimpact of some chemicals/pollutants to be carried out _  in vitro _before  _in\nvivo_  studies, to establish whether they impact on leucocyte function and\ntherefore potentially fish health and welfare.\n\n## Publications\n\n  1.
