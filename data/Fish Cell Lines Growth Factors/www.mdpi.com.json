Summary\n\nThe field of cell culture technology involves the cultivation of cells in a\ncontrolled environment, mimicking the natural conditions found in living\norganisms. This process is performed on a large scale, utilizing a specially\ndesigned culture medium. The goal is to create either undifferentiated\nindividual cells or multicellular aggregates with minimal differentiation. The\npresent paper offers a comprehensive overview of the advancements and\napplications of primary cell culture techniques in fish. It places a\nparticular focus on revealing the physiological roles played by fish cells\nduring their in vitro cultivation. Maintaining the functional characteristics\nof fish cells is of paramount importance, as it is essential for gaining a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing various\nphysiological processes. To facilitate the use of fish cells in research and\npractical applications, it is crucial to standardize the separation techniques\nfor these cells and optimize the conditions for their culture. This not only\ncontributes to our knowledge of fish health, disease development, and drug\ndiscovery but also drives progress in the aquaculture industry.\n\n##  Abstract\n\nFish primary cell culture has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating the\nphysiological roles and responses of various cell types found in fish species.\nThis review aims to provide an overview of the advancements and applications\nof fish primary cell culture techniques, focusing on the profiling of\nphysiological roles exhibited by fish cells in vitro. Fish primary cell\nculture involves the isolation and cultivation of cells directly derived from\nfish tissues, maintaining their functional characteristics and enabling\nresearchers to study their behavior and responses under controlled conditions.\nOver the years, significant progress has been made in optimizing the culture\nconditions, establishing standardized protocols, and improving the\ncharacterization techniques for fish primary cell cultures. The review\nhighlights the diverse cell types that have been successfully cultured from\ndifferent fish species, including gonad cells, pituitary cells, muscle cells,\nhepatocytes, kidney and immune cells, adipocyte cells and myeloid cells, brain\ncells, primary fin cells, gill cells, and other cells. Each cell type exhibits\ndistinct physiological functions, contributing to vital processes such as\nmetabolism, tissue regeneration, immune response, and toxin metabolism.\nFurthermore, this paper explores the pivotal role of fish primary cell culture\nin elucidating the mechanisms underlying various physiological processes.\nResearchers have utilized fish primary cell cultures to study the effects of\nenvironmental factors, toxins, pathogens, and pharmaceutical compounds on\ncellular functions, providing valuable insights into fish health, disease\npathogenesis, and drug development. The paper also discusses the application\nof fish primary cell cultures in aquaculture research, particularly in\ninvestigating fish growth, nutrition, reproduction, and stress responses. By\nmimicking the in vivo conditions in vitro, primary cell culture has proven\ninstrumental in identifying key factors influencing fish health and\nperformance, thereby contributing to the development of sustainable\naquaculture practices.\n\nKeywords:\n\nprimary fish cell culture; fish cell line; fisheries science; aquaculture\n\n##  1\\. Introduction\n\nThe field of cell culture technology has its roots in the early 20th century\nand, since then, has boasted a rich history that spans over a century.\nResearch into primary cell culture techniques for fish began in the middle of\nthe last century. Notably, the first permanent cell line of fish origin was\npioneered by Wolf and Quimby in 1962, using gonadal cells from rainbow trout\n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) [1]. Throughout the mid-20th century, there was a\nsignificant increase in the availability of tissues suitable for primary cell\nculture. This development paved the way for successful applications of various\nfish tissues, including liver, spleen, gonads, fin strips, skin, and fish\ncells in the fields of immune system research, vaccine research, and\nbiomedical research. For example, primary culture of zebrafish embryonic stem\ncells provided a means to examine retinal pigment differentiation and function\nprior to optic organogenesis [2]. Fish cell cultures have multiple scientific\nobjectives, such as study of virus diagnosis skills, the study of the\nthermoregulation mechanism, endocrinological investigation, and viral disease\ndiagnosis [3,4]. They can also be used as a suitable model for evaluating the\noxidation reaction, chemistry toxicology tests, and mechanism research [5]. In\nenvironmental science, fish cells are in use for detecting the impacts of\nenvironmental pollutants and toxicology of aquatic ecosystems [4,6].\n\nPrimary cell culture has many scientific superiorities and can be kept for\nweeks, so it can be used for vitro detecting systems [7]. Primary cells have\nhigh viability and some essential cellular functions can be maintained in\nvitro such as cell proliferation and differentiation [8]. For example,\ndetached testis cells were gathered in one day and isolated into colonies,\nwhich adhered to Petri medium or carried out suspended growth [9]. Under\nselected experimental conditions, researchers can culture the cells of\ninterest in vitro and study them at a cellular level. They can survive and\nretain specific characteristics of the cell type for at least a few days in\nmany cases [9]. Alternatively, primary cells can retain more original\nfunctions and abilities compared with cell lines with limited ability [10].\nPrimary cells and cell lines both have advantages and disadvantages. The\ngrowth rate of primary cells is notably slow, and conventionally, the initial\ngeneration of primary cell culture and its subsequent passages up to the 10th\ngeneration collectively form the primary culture. Beyond approximately 10\ngenerations, primary cultured cells present a formidable challenge for\npropagation. Cellular growth tends to stagnate, and most cells undergo\nsenescence and apoptosis. Nevertheless, a small fraction of cells somehow\nendure this crisis, persisting in propagation. Some of these cells may even\nundergo genetic alterations and acquire malignant characteristics, allowing\nfor indefinite passageability, which is referred to as a cell line. Primary\ncells, isolated directly from animal tissues through enzymatic or mechanical\nmethods, are often considered more biologically relevant than cell lines. This\nis because their biological responses may closely mimic in vivo conditions,\nbringing researchers closer to the \u201ctruth\u201d [11]. Early cultures of primary\ncells can offer a more accurate model of in vivo tissues [12]. However, the\nproduction of short-term primary cultures faces challenges related to the\nreproducibility of initiation and the homogeneity of cultures, limiting their\napplications [13]. The advantages of easy culture, diversity, and substantial\nyield have positioned cell lines as the preferred choice for cellular-level\nresearch. Nevertheless, it is important to note that continuous culturing of\ncell lines can lead to mutations over time, potentially altering both their\ngenotype and phenotype, which in turn may impact experimental outcomes.\nPrimary cells do not encounter these problems. For instance, cells obtained\nfrom EK293 transfected with adenovirus exhibited characteristics closer to\nimmature neurons [14]. The MDA-435 cell line, long utilized as a\nrepresentative model for breast cancer, has recently raised questions about\nits true identity, with accumulating evidence suggesting its potential\nclassification as a melanoma cell [15]. In summary, for experiments that\ncannot be conducted within living organisms, primary cells can maintain a high\nlevel of biological characteristics and thus offer a partial solution to this\nissue (Table 1). Vitro cell culture is a fascinating experiment method as the\ncells can maintain their interaction, polarity, and topology [7]. The main\nbenefit is that the primary fish cells would be reassembled into a single-\nlayer structure, which can represent the most primitive state of the living\nfish instead of complex tissues. Moreover, in vitro cell culture has a very\nlow cost as cell care does not require large farming facilities and large\namounts of water compared to live fish [5].\n\nThe principles and techniques of fish cell culture draw heavily from mammalian\ncell culture practices. However, when compared to mammalian cell culture, fish\ncell culture presents some distinct characteristics. Notably, fish cell\nculture boasts several advantages including its ability to adapt to a wide\nrange of temperatures, higher tolerance to hypoxia, and the ease of\nmaintaining cell cultures for extended durations [16]. In particular, in\nphysiology, fish cell culture can provide a perfect instrument for studying\nthe response of cells to different culture temperatures because fish primary\ncell culture can simulate living conditions in vivo [17]. In immunology, cell\ncultures are indispensable in allowing viral transmission and they make a\nsignificant contribution to the development of vaccines to prevent multiple\nfish diseases [18]. In ecotoxicology, the utility of fish cell culture also\nhas unrivaled benefits, such as quick revolution, convenience, ease of\nidentification, effectiveness, and high specificity compared with vivo\norganism testing [3]. Technically and scientifically, vitro cell culture\ntechniques can screen many specimens for a reasonable cost, especially for\nenvironment toxicant assays [4]. Furthermore, primary fish cell cultures can\nreduce the number of animals killed, because it is moral to kill fewer fish\n[3]. Extrinsic cytotoxicity testing has the advantage of being able to quickly\ndetect the potential virulent concentration of specific substances, for\ninstance, chemical or nanomaterial. This is an excellent toxicity grading and\ngrouping tool that can be used as a pre-screening intelligent detection\nstrategy to help regulators make decisions and reduce in vivo testing [19]. It\nis also an available instrument to measure the poisoning of various marine\npollutants [4]. Recently, fish have emerged as a suitable model and a\npromising alternative to the classical mammalian systems to study vertebrate\ndevelopment.\n\nThe growing economic significance of aquaculture has driven increased research\ninto the healthy development and pathological occurrences of fish, with\nparticular attention being paid to the prevention and control of freshwater\nand seawater diseases, as well as environmental issues. The advancement of\ncell culture technology has played a pivotal role in enabling research in\ngenomics, the study of virus\u2013host interaction studies, bacterial\nidentification, heavy metal toxicity analysis, and stem cell function\nresearch. To our knowledge, no review has summarized the information on\nprimary cell cultures from different fish tissues. Thus, we report on the\nprogress of primary cell cultures derived from the gonad, pituitary, muscle,\nliver, kidney, adipocyte, myeloid, brain, fin, and gill and the historical\nbackground, practical applications, and cultivation techniques employed in\nfish cell culture in this review (Figure 1). It is expected to provide some\nvaluable references for the development of fish primary cell culture and the\nestablishment of cell lines.\n\n**Figure 1.** General view of primary cell culture from various tissues or\norgans including brain, pitui-tary, muscle, liver, bone, gonad, kidney, fat,\nand gill.\n\n##  2\\. Primary Cells of Each Tissue\n\n####  2.1. Fish Gonad Cells\n\nThe major cell types of fish sexual gland cells are gonad cells and\nsurrounding somatic cells. The main function of the surrounding somatic cells\nis to produce developmental gonad cells and to synthesize relevant steroids to\nadjust the development and maturation of oocytes and spermatocytes [13]. The\ninteraction between gonad cells and surrounding somatic cells may play a role\nduring the development of functional sex and developmental gonad cells of fish\n[20]. In teleosts, ovarian stem cells are derived from the epithelium of the\novary, and hormones ejected by the pituitary can influence the follicles\u2019\ngrowth, development, and maturity [21]. In the male testis, local ligands,\nderiving from multifarious testicular germ cells, especially for growth\nfactors, can regulate and modify the function of testicular support cells and\nmesenchymal cells through spermatogenesis. In the female ovary, ovary membrane\ncells are important for regulating and producing androgens and aromatase from\nvitro granulosa cells [10].\n\nAccording to morphological observation, follicular cells and testicular cells\nare composed of different types of cells from gonadal tissues. Primary gonadal\ncells (testicular cells) from large yellow crocea (Larimichthys crocea) were\ncultured for study [22]. This system was used to be closer to the body than\ncell lines, because different paracrine factors in various cells can be\npresented in the endocrine system [10]. An in vitro test system using primary\ntestis cells of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) was established that provides\nquantitative data on cell proliferation and cell viability [9]. Primary cell\ncultures (ovarian follicular and testicular cells) of the marine medaka\n(Oryzias melastigma) were used to screen the environmentally relevant levels\nof endocrine-disrupting chemicals [10]. Primary sperm cultures can be regarded\nas an adaptive detection system to analyze endocrine disruptors and other\nsubstances suspected of interfering with fish sperm formation [7]. Flow\ncytometry of sperm cells can be easily quantified to explore the various cell\nindexes, including cellular size and cellular ploidy. Therefore, the technique\nis widely used in the research of spermatogenesis covering the kinetics of\ncellular proliferation on the basis of the continuous decline of fluorescence\ndensity in each cleavage cell [9]. Primary cell culture in the ovary of medaka\nwas used to show that nanosilver can have effects on hormone production and\ncell apoptosis in teleosts. The in vitro model was used to evaluate endocrine\ndisruption and toxicity [23].\n\n####  2.2. Fish Pituitary Cells\n\nPituitary cells are mainly related to reproduction, growth, and stress\nresponse [10]. The pituitary displays different families of structurally and\nfunctionally related adenohypophyseal hormones: single-chain polypeptide and\nglycoprotein hormones (growth hormone (GH); prolactin (PRL); somatolactin\n(SL); gonadotropins (GTH); and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) and\nproopiomelanocortin-derived hormones (adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) and\nmelanophore-stimulating hormone (MSH)) [24]. Atlantic cod\u2019s primary pituitary\ncell culture was used to study the underlying immediate impacts of cortisol.\nIt provided evidence that cortisol stimulates cellular activity and affects\nreproductive expression [25]. Cortisol stimulates the release of growth\nhormone through the nitric oxide pathways and the degradation pathways of\nguanine nucleotides (GMP routes) independent pathways [26]. The GMP routes do\nnot participate in the suppression of growth hormone release in a grouper\npituitary cell culture platform. Irisin directly inhibits the gene expression\nand secretion of growth hormone when using primary tilapia pituitary cells.\nAnd atropin could stimulate the expression of genes related to growth hormone\nvia direct action at the pituitary level [27,28].\n\nCod\u2019s primary pituitary cells were used in electro-physiological experiments\nand culturing conditions were optimized: cells that were incubated in M199\nmedium with osmolality of 320 mOsm were close to the natural plasma osmolality\nof cod; 26.2 mM HCO3\u22121 was used in M199 medium and the CO2 concentration of\nthe incubating environment was set as 0.5% which led to the physiological pH\nof 7.85. Serum was necessary for pituitary cell culture and bovine serum\nalbumin should be supplemented. This serum substitute should contain\ncomponents that keep the structure and plasma membrane intact because they can\ninfluence the cell physiology [29]. The optimized culture conditions for\nmedaka (Oryzias latipes) pituitary primary cells were established and\ninvestigated [12].\n\n####  2.3. Fish Muscle Cells\n\nFish muscles are of particular importance from a practical aquaculture view\nbecause the weight of fish muscles determines the yield of aquaculture. So,\nunderstanding muscle cells is essential for aquaculture to increase fish\nproduction [30]. Trout myocyte culture was explored in 1995, optimized in\n1998, and regarded as an available tool to analyze the rule of insulin-like\ngrowth factor (IGF) in muscle cells of trout in 2002 [31]. Primary muscle cell\nculture was incorporated at an osmolarity of 360 mOsm and a temperature of\n15\u201321 \u00b0C for trout and sea bream [31]. F10 medium was better for muscle cell\nculture to control in vitro myoblast proliferation and differentiation [32].\nThe muscle tissue cells from grass goldfish were primary cultured at various\ntime points after seeding [33]. Primary trout muscle cell culture was\nperformed to explore the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of autophagy-\nrelated genes after food starvation [30]. Primary muscle cell culture of\ngilthead sea bream was developed to characterize insulin growth factor-1\nbinding during myocyte differentiation, which is involved in the role of\ninsulin in metabolism and growth of muscle cells of black bream [31]. Primary\nbrown trout muscle cells can replicate the differentiation process in skeletal\nmuscle and have been used to study the direct metabolism of hormones and\ncytokines in the muscle of trout [34]. The extracted muscle cells were\ncharacterized to validate the role of myogenesis in trout [32].\n\n####  2.4. Fish Hepatocytes\n\nPrimary fish liver cells have been shown to be multifunctional and the primary\ncell culture of liver is widely used for donor organs. In primary culture,\nfish liver cells can maintain the natural characteristics of liver, and\nprimary liver cells are used for biotransformation, detoxification, and fat\ngeneration [35]. Liver cells are commonly used in the study of ecotoxicology.\nHepatocytes have been shown to be of use for toxicological screening of\ncytotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and bioaccumulation through a variety of\ntests including suspension, monolayer, and three-dimensional sphere cultures\n[36]. Primary hepatocytes were extracted from orange grouper to evaluate the\ntoxic effects of nonylphenol on hepatocyte activity and the antioxidant system\nin the liver. Nonylphenol was found to affect the balance of antioxidant\ndefense and lead to the oxidation imbalance of primary hepatocytes [3].\nPrimary hepatocytes were isolated successfully from arctic char. The\noptimization of culture conditions to determine the analytical conditions\nprovides a common tool for screening the potential impact of contaminants and\ncomplex samples\u2019 exposure to chemicals [35]. Brown trout hepatocytes in an in\nvitro model were linked to the physiological and toxicological effects of\nnuclear receptors in cross-regulation and cross-interference of the peroxidase\npathway [37]. Primary hepatocytes can be used as a sensitivity test system to\nmeasure the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials [38]. Copper nanoparticles were\ntoxic to primary grouper hepatocytes, but the toxicity of CuSO4 was more\nsevere than that of copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) [39]. It was reported that\nbenzopyrene had the potential to induce oxidative stress in primary grouper\nliver cells and the oxidative effects of benzopyrene were assessed as a\npotential toxicology research technique [4]. Fish liver cell lines were also\nwidely used in vitro models to study the adverse effects of pollutants in the\nmarine environment [40]. The use of a 3-D in vitro liver organoid culture\nsystem (spheroids) derived from rainbow trout was reported to measure the\nmetabolism of pharmaceuticals using a substrate depletion assay. Hepatocyte\nisolation and cell culture from Lake Van fish have been successfully achieved\n[41]. Liver spheroids could be used as a relevant and metabolically competent\nin vitro model to measure the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals in fish\n[42].\n\nPrimary fish hepatocytes have been considered as a model for functional\nstudies of fish. For example, using a primary culture of fish hepatocytes, the\neffect of insulin on fat generation and lipid hydrolysis can help to\nunderstand the regulation of lipid metabolism in vivo at transcription and\nenzyme levels [43]. Furthermore, palmitic acid treatment in large yellow\ncroaker hepatocytes was used to mimic the effect of feeds for farmed fish and\nit was found that hepatic cellular triacylglycerol accumulation was\nsignificantly higher in palmitic acid treatment [44]. One method was\nsuccessfully established in trout liver cells to silence the activity of\nperoxidase proliferator-activated receptor (gene silencing efficiency was\nabout 70%) and showed morphological characteristics of the phenotype after\nsilencing [45].\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) was performed to knock down a STAT family member\n(stat5bl) using primary liver cell culture and could regulate the JAK/STAT\npathway to improve fish immunity [46]. Detection of pH regulation ability in\nprimary sturgeon hepatocytes can be used to assess the suitability of the\ncellular mechanism of CO2 tolerance in sturgeon, and primary sturgeon liver\ncells can compensate for intracellular acidosis caused by hypercapnia [47]. A\nstudy showed that during isolation and culture of primary hepatocytes from\nyellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco), Zn attenuated Cu-induced\nlipotoxicity by reducing lipogenesis and stimulating lipolysis [48], and the\nhepatocytes were incubated with ZnO NPs (10 \u03bcg/mL) to investigate the\nmechanisms by which ZnO NPs influence the Zn absorption and lipid metabolism\n[49].\n\n####  2.5. Fish Kidney and Immune Cells\n\nFish kidneys are typically divided into two parts: the head kidney and the\nposterior kidney. The primary function of the posterior kidney is to regulate\nwater balance, excrete divalent ions, and manage metabolic processes [50].\nInterestingly, this aspect is seldom discussed in the literature. On the other\nhand, the head kidney primarily plays a crucial role in the production of\nmacrophages in fish. These macrophages, derived from the head kidney, exhibit\nthe capacity to phagocytize, produce radicals, and polarize into either\ninnately activated or alternatively activated macrophages [51]. Consequently,\nthey play a pivotal role in both the innate and acquired immune responses of\nfish [52]. In an exciting development, a continuous cell line has been\nestablished, characterized, and isolated from the head kidney of a large\nyellow croaker. This cell line holds significant potential as a valuable tool\nfor studying immune-related genes and functions [53]. Furthermore, a study\ninvolving seabass head kidney in vitro research has shed light on the\nimmunomodulatory effects of various amino acids. This underscores the\npotential for developing an immune nutrition strategy [54]. The aquaculture\nindustry has suffered significant economic losses due to bacterial and viral\ninfections. In order to mitigate these losses, cell cultures offer a viable\nalternative to in vivo experimentation. A study was conducted on kidney\nprimary cell cultures from three Chilean salmonids, namely Salmo salar,\nOncorhynchus kisutch, and Oncorhynchus mykiss. The aim of the study was to\ncharacterize the response to bacterial and viral stimuli by evaluating various\nmarkers associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses [55]. In\nanother study, the time course of stimulation with growth hormone (GH) and\ngrowth hormone release factor (GRF) was described in two experimental models:\nthe first model involved the SHK-1 cell line derived from primary cultures of\nadherent cells from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) head kidney, which exhibited\nphagocytic characteristics; and the second model utilized leukocytes isolated\nfrom the head kidney of Atlantic salmon. The results indicated differential\nregulation between these two models, providing a better understanding of the\nindependent action of GH on the immune system [56]. In the head kidney\ncellular primary cell culture of sea bream and rainbow trout, cortisol had a\nprominent influence on the expression of major inflammatory cytokines [57].\nFurthermore, corticotropin caused a distinct regulation of cytokines in the\nexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in the head kidney cells of rainbow\ntrout and sea bream, which suggested that stress hormones have different\nregulatory effects on the immune response of teleosts [58]. A protocol of\nprimary wolf fish kidney monocytic cells was used to develop and evaluate the\ntoxicity by exposure to different NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory\nDrugs) [59].\n\nPhagocytes are the body\u2019s first line of defense against foreign invasion and\nthe bridge between the body\u2019s innate immune system and the adaptive immune\nsystem [60]. In this case, macrophages are key immune cells in the early\nstages of infection as they not only secrete cytokines to regulate the\nactivation and migration of other white blood cells but also occupy an\nimportant role in phagocytosis and antigen recognition [61]. Macrophages are\nsome of the most significant effector cells in the natural immune system. The\nability to swallow pathogens and coordinate immune responses depends on the\npresence of different surface receptors, such as scavenger receptors and Toll-\nlike receptors [6]. Primary head kidney macrophages were isolated from red\ncarp, the immune regulatory effects were investigated, and immune systems were\nsimplified and improved [5]. The functional characterization of interleukin\nand its role in the induction of primary renal macrophages in goldfish was\nconfirmed and the conservatism of interleukin-induced selective activation of\nmacrophages and the importance of polarization of macrophages in the evolution\nof epigenetic animals were emphasized [62]. Eel primary macrophages were\ndeveloped and described from head kidney in vitro. The phagocytic activity was\nmeasured in the derived cells of head kidney, and the cell culture system\noffered an important resource for identifying molecular tools and useful\nmodels for studying the interactions between specific eel pathogens [6].\nMoreover, respiratory burst and phagocytic activity were evaluated by primary\nculture of renal leukocytes [60]. N6-cyclohexyl played a down-regulating role\nin the innate immune function of white blood cells in the head kidney, while\nadenosine did not down-regulate, suggesting the existence of purine receptors\nin fish immune cells [63].\n\n####  2.6. Fish Adipocyte Cells and Myeloid Cells\n\nSuperfluous accumulation of fat tissue in cultured fish is a prominent problem\nin fish aquaculture. A continued intensification in aquaculture can lead to\nthe development of calorie-rich food, which can lead to an increase in\nsubcutaneous and visceral fat. Such obesity can have a negative effect on fish\nhealth. Primary culture of fish fat cells has been proven to be an effective\nmethod to detect the effects of hormones on fat production and metabolism\n[64]. The primary adipocytes of red sea bream were cultivated using an\ninduction medium [65].\n\nBy comparing the effects of organotin on adipocyte development and lipid\nmetabolism in rainbow trout cell culture, the main use of adipocyte culture\nwas as a valuable tool to estimate the ability of different compounds to\ninterfere with adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation [66]. The\neffects of leptin and ghrelin on the expression of genes related to\nlipogenesis, lipolysis, and lipid metabolism in rainbow trout fat cells were\ninvestigated [67]. Rainbow trout adipocyte cells were applied for coordinating\nthe expression of related lipid-droplet genes in proliferation and\ndifferentiation, which occupies a critical role in specific stages of fish fat\nformation [68].\n\nAdipocyte cells and bone cells were often studied in previous research. The\nadipocyte and bone-derived cells of sea bream can be differentiated into\nadipocyte-like cells after adding the differentiation medium. Mesenchymal stem\ncells are from fatty tissue or vertebrae of sea bream. The expression profiles\nof genes and transcription factors were studied to relate them to lipid\nmetabolism during lipogenesis [69]. Myeloid cells, including macrophages,\nneutrophils, granulocytes, thrombocytes, and erythrocytes, which are from a\nsmall number of hematopoietic stem cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells\n(Figure 2) are collectively related to myelopoiesis [70]. Primary cell\ncultures have been established from sea bream. During culture, mineral\ndeposition in extracellular matrix can promote the addition of osteogenic\nmedium [71]. Previous studies were conducted on the process of bone formation\nin fish. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and insulin were identified as\nregulators of bone marrow cell proliferation, which has a great significance\nfor better understanding the development of bone growth and bone deformity of\nfish and improving the quality of aquaculture products in the future [31].\n\n**Figure 2.** The cells derived from fishbone. Myeloid cells develop into\nhematopoietic progenitor cells following by monocytes. Then, monocytes evolve\ninto granulocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, thrombocytes, and erythrocytes.\nMacrophages ultimately transform into liver Kupffer cells, osteoclasts,\nhistiocytes, and microglia.\n\n####  2.7. Fish Brain Cells\n\nThe cell types of brains can be divided into microglia, neurons, and\nastroglia. Primary brain cell culture was performed for giant grouper.\nInterleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were found to cause the death of\nneurons in brain cells after nervous necrosis virus infection [72]. The effect\nof kisspeptin decapeptide on the expression of reproduction-related genes was\nevaluated using the primary hypothalamic culture system, and the results\nshowed that kisspeptin had no effect on gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the\nbrain cells of tongue sole [44]. Primary neuron cultures of Senegalese sole\nwere established and analyzed using a detailed protocol, which proved the\neffects of two capsid mutations in recombinant strains on virus replication of\nnerve cells [73]. A continuous cell line from the brain of perch was\nsusceptible to necrosis and the culture system provided a useful tool to study\nepidemiology, viral pathology, and vaccine development [74]. Cell lines of\ngrouper brain tissue were established and their susceptibility was studied,\nincluding to red-spot grouper neuro-necrosis virus, Singapore grouper iris\nvirus, and lymphocytosis virus [75].\n\n####  2.8. Fish Gill Cells\n\nGills are the main organs for fish to exchange gas and ions with the external\nenvironment. Branchial cells have a complex epithelial tissue composed of\nthree main types of cells in direct contact with the environment: pavement\ncells (also known as respiratory cells), mitochondria-rich cells (also known\nas chlorine cells), and mucous cells [76]. Branchial ion extrusion is thought\nto occur between columnar or elliptical ionic cells, known as mitochondria-\nrich cells (MRCs) and adjacent cells referred to as thin-laminar adherent\ncells (ACs). Na+ enters the apical fossa of MRCs through \u201cleaky\u201d paracellular\nconnections between MRCs and interlaced ACs [77]. The pavement cells mainly\ncover the chloride ion cells on the branchial filaments and branchial lamella.\nThe mucous cells are in the lamella epithelium and their secretion may be a\nmechanism to adapt to different water conditions [78]. A study identified the\nhypotonic responsive genes in gill cells and profiled the gill microbiota\ncommunities after a freshwater transfer experiment via transcriptome\nsequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, suggesting the host\u2013bacterium\ninteraction in the gill facilitates freshwater acclimation [17].\n\nThe establishment of the freshwater teleost gill model was based on the\nreconstruction of squamous epithelium on the permeable membrane of primary\nculture [79]. In vitro culture of gill epithelium has two unique advantages.\nThe first advantage is the use of freshly isolated gill cells to obtain\ninformation on ion transport in filament surfaces and MRCs to explain the\nosmotic mechanism. The second advantage is that gill filaments can be cultured\nin a culture medium for almost four days [78]. The Percoll method is the best\nmethod for gill cell isolation; PercollTM-gradient-isolated gill chloride (CC)\nand pavement cells (PVCs) were settled and the regulation of their expression\nin primary gill cell culture was determined [80,81,82]. The primary culture of\ngill epithelial cells from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been\nsuccessfully investigated [83]. The primary culture of fish gill cells can\nprovide a functional, cell-diversified and model culture platform in vitro. In\na study to prolong the viability of primary gill cell cultures in rainbow\ntrout, a method was established to prolong the viability of cultures during\nprolonged exposure to water, with the utility of this model extending to a\nvariety of longer-term exposure scenarios [82].\n\nGill cells are mainly studied for osmoregulation. Previous studies have\nrevealed that the cascade of osmotic signals may be related to the regulation\nof downstream effects [84]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases and myosin\nlight-chain kinases were explored in the early phase of hyperosmotic challenge\nusing primary freshwater teleost branchial cell culture [85]. Short-term\nhyperosmotic challenges can activate multiple severalsignaling pathways. For\nexample, histone phosphorylation and downstream effectors played a role in\nfreshwater gill cells and hypertonicity-challenge-induced MAPK-dependent\nphosphorylation pathways [86]. The differential expression of osmotic stress\ntranscriptional factor (Ostf) was first revealed in isolated CCs and PVCs\n[80]. A study confirmed that cortisol directly acts on glycogen-rich cells in\nthe gills of tilapia and regulates glycogen metabolism by promoting glycogen\nphosphorylase isoform (GPGG) mRNA expression [87]. To maintain their good\nhealth, the immune response can be generated by fish gills against external\nthreats as the first line of immune defense [81]. The physiological and immune\nfunctions of tilapia gills are widely understood, but their functional\nheterogeneity at the single-cell scale has rarely been reported. One study\nperformed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the gills of tilapia\n(Oreochromis niloticus) and identified 12 cell populations and analyzed their\nfunctional heterogeneity [88]. The single-cell datasets provide a reference\nfor marker gene establishment of gills and serve as a platform for future\nstudies investigating the physiological and immune function of gills.\n\nThe absorption rate of ten drugs was determined by a gill cell culture system\n[89]. The effect of ferric sulfate (FeSO4\u00b77H2O) on the semi-permeable membrane\nculture of primary gill cells of rainbow trout was studied. This model was\nused to study the toxicity and drug resistance of gill epithelial cells [90].\nIn addition, the study has demonstrated that the cultured gill epithelia of\nrainbow trout can be optimized to exhibit tolerance towards seawater, enabling\ntheir utilization in toxicological assessments of pollutants suspended in\nseawater, thus simulating conditions found in marine ecosystems [81]. This\noptimized gill cell system represents a viable in vitro approach for\nconducting toxicological studies on marine ecosystems, thereby facilitating\neffective pollution control and management. Significant progress has been made\nin the assessment of fish toxicity of microalgal species using highly\nsensitive and reproducible fish RTgill-W1 gill cell lines [91]. The potential\nof the primary gill cell culture system was further demonstrated for\nenvironmental monitoring and biotransformation of organic compounds in\nbranchial cells [92]. Previous studies have reported how to reconstruct and\nculture freshwater rainbow trout gill epithelium on a flat permeable membrane.\nThe system can be used for freshwater gill physiology and toxicity studies,\nbioaccumulation studies, and environmental water quality monitoring [93].\n\n####  2.9. Fish Intestinal Epithelial Cells\n\nThe intestine plays a pivotal role in fish physiology, serving as the primary\nsite for digestion, nutrient absorption, and various crucial functions\nincluding osmoregulation, acid\u2013base balance, and the excretion of specific\nmetabolic byproducts [94]. Within the intestinal epithelium, monolayer cells\npossess dual functions, as they both absorb essential substances and serve as\na defense against harmful ones. The luminal cells in the intestine are closely\nlinked to the epithelial cells by a brush border, forming a relatively\nimpermeable membrane [95]. These intestinal epithelial cells also act as vital\nbarriers to protect the gut and can be influenced by dietary nutrition and\nenvironmental factors [96]. For example, in aquaculture, prebiotics are\nintricate carbohydrate molecules that are not directly digested by fish but\nare metabolized by the microbial community within the host gut. This process\npromotes the growth of \u201cbeneficial\u201d bacterial species, subsequently enhancing\nfish performance.\n\nIt is worth noting that gut cells may directly respond to these dietary\ncomponents, contributing to research on fish gut health [97]. Additionally,\ncultured fish intestinal epithelial cells can release warning substances\nagainst predatory behavior [98]. In cases of deteriorating water quality and\nfeed quality, many carnivorous fish become susceptible to bacterial intestinal\ndiseases, posing challenges to the sustainable development of the aquaculture\nindustry. A novel ex vivo culture method using primary intestinal epithelial\ncells from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, has been established and\nmaintained over the long term. This in vitro system allows for the study of\nfundamental processes related to regional differences in dietary uptake and\ncontaminant metabolism. It also provides a means to reduce the number of fish\nrequired for biological studies [99]. Some studies have employed transcriptome\nsequencing technology to comprehensively and rapidly obtain all transcript\ninformation during the exposure of intestinal epithelial cells of cyprinid\ncarp to lipopolysaccharides (the main virulence factor of Gram-negative\nbacteria). This systematic analysis of gene expression changes provides a\ntheoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the\nregulation of intestinal epithelial cells in Cyprinus carpio by\nlipopolysaccharides [100].\n\n####  2.10. Other Cells\n\nFor neuron cells, using electrophysiological analysis to isolate and culture\nneurons from the spinal cord of adult zebrafish, this new primary cell culture\nsystem provides in vitro methodology and new tools for neurophysiological\nresearch [101].\n\nThe fin cell line is very versatile because it has a high reproductive\ncapacity and the success rate of cell migration is high [10,102]. At the same\ntime, many fish cells are derived from fin tissue, such as primary cell\ncultures derived from the fin of the endangered Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser\ndabryanus) [103]. Fish polyploid cells can be inferred by the karyotype of\ntheir fin cells. Three cell lines were established in fin primary culture of\ndiploid crucian, triploid hybridization, and allotetraploids. And one marker\ngene, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), was used to further identify\ncell karyotype [104]. Primary goldfish culture cells were derived from the\ncaudal fin and incubated with a temperature range of 20 to 35 \u2103. The results\nindicated that goldfish cells were produced with different temperatures and\ntended to show stable physiological states related to temperature after\ntemperature changes [105]. The establishment of a pomfret fin cell line would\noffer a beneficial in vitro tool for mechanism studies about pathogen\ninteraction [106]. The koi fin cell line was established to develop effective\ndiagnostic methods for detecting and monitoring viral infections in the case\nof outbreaks of koi herpes virus disease in India [107].\n\n##  3\\. Common Methods for Fish Cell Isolation\n\nThe development of fish cell culture is a relatively recent advancement\ncompared to mammalian cell culture, and its methodologies have been adapted\nfrom those used in mammals. Nevertheless, there are notable differences.\nTemperature control in cell culture is a critical factor, closely tied to the\ntemperature preferences of the fish species. Since fish are poikilotherms,\ntheir cell culture temperature range is broader than that of mammals. Passage\nfrequency, occurring every 7 to 14 days in fish cells, is comparatively lower\nthan the 4-day passage frequency of mammalian cells [108]. Fish cells also\nexhibit a slower metabolic rate, allowing them to be maintained in cell\nculture for short periods (several months) due to their sluggish metabolism in\na relatively cool environment. For long-term preservation, storage in liquid\nnitrogen (\u2212196 \u00b0C) is necessary. The isolation of primary fish cells primarily\nrelies on methods developed for mammalian cells, including the tissue block\nmethod, mechanical crushing method, and enzyme digestion method.\n\n####  3.1. Enzymatic Digestion\n\nThe enzyme digestion method involves removing interstitial components, such as\nmatrix and fibers, which can hinder cell growth. This results in the\ndispersion of cells into a suspension, facilitating better nutrient absorption\nand efficient elimination of metabolic waste. Using the enzyme digestion\nmethod eliminates issues related to selective cell growth due to mobility,\nallowing for the rapid acquisition of a significant number of representative\ncells within a short timeframe. Protein-digesting enzymes commonly used for in\nvitro cell isolation include trypsin, collagenase, lysozyme, pepsin, and\nneutral protease, with trypsin and collagenase being frequently employed. In\nthe process of fish cell isolation and culture using enzymatic digestion, the\nfish are first sterilized by immersing them in 75% ethanol after anesthesia.\nThe dissected tissues are then placed into a cell buffer, cut into small\npieces in a Petri dish using a sharp scalpel, and passed through different\nmicropipette tips. Afterward, the softened tissue is agitated and passed\nthrough a disposable mesh (100 \u00b5m). The remaining tissue on the mesh is\nsubjected to collagenase treatment and sieving. The suspension containing the\nisolated cells undergoes centrifugation and washing before being placed into\nthe culture medium [41,109]. For example, trypsin was used to isolate large\nyellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) gonadal cells, establish cell lines, and\nexplore gene expression [22].\n\n####  3.2. Tissue Block Adhesion Method\n\nThis method is suitable for tissues with low volume or dense growth, such as\nfin strips, skin, muscle, and gonads, where mechanical or enzymatic hydrolysis\nmay cause cellular damage. However, a limitation of the tissue block adhesion\nmethod lies in its selective adhesion to certain tissues and their subsequent\noutward migration and growth. Nonetheless, this method remains one of the\ncommonly used, straightforward, and feasible primary cell culture techniques.\nIt involves the aseptic separation of the target tissue, followed by the\nremoval of impurities like membranes, lipids, and blood using a buffer\nsolution. Sterile anatomical tools are used to divide the tissue block into 1\nmm3 pieces, which are then inoculated at the bottom of a cell bottle.\nSubsequently, culture medium is added, and the bottle is transferred to an\nincubator for cultivation. It is crucial to master the adhesion time to\nprevent nutritional-deficiency-induced death of tissue cells [110]. Cells\ncultured using the tissue block adhesion method have the advantage of\nmaintaining complete cell morphology and strong proliferation ability. For\ninstance, Li et al. isolated and cultured grass goldfish (Carassius auratus)\nmuscle primary cells using the tissue block adhesion method and established a\nnew continuous fish cell line (CAM) [33].\n\n####  3.3. Mechanical Crushing\n\nThe mechanical crushing method is suitable for tissues that have soft\nelectrolytes, fewer fibrous components, and can withstand mechanical\nseparation. Examples of such tissues include embryos, spleens, livers, adult\nfish brains, and soft tumors. This method involves breaking down and isolating\ntissue blocks into individual cells through various physical techniques, such\nas repeated grinding and filtration or tissue disruption using nylon mesh and\nstainless steel mesh. Subsequently, centrifugation is employed to obtain a\nsingle-cell suspension. While this approach allows for the rapid acquisition\nof a large number of cells, it is susceptible to causing mechanical damage.\nThe tissue adhesion method, when used for primary cell culture, results in\nslow cellular migration and is applicable to only a limited range of tissues.\nOn the other hand, the enzymatic digestion method carries a risk of cell\ndamage during processing, prompting many researchers to prefer mechanical\ncrushing as a viable alternative. This method was successfully utilized for\nthe isolation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from grass carp, yielding\nfavorable results [111].\n\n##  4\\. Perspectives and Future Developments\n\nThe transfection efficiency of gonadal cell lines from sole was up to 40%.\nTherefore, an effective method for transfection is imperative. In many vitro\nstudies of primary cultured fish cells, the cultured living cells have\ncharacteristics that were similar to those of intact cells in vivo. However,\nimportant functional characteristics of cells may be lost in cell dispersion\nor the following culture, although primary cells can remain active for a long\ntime [29]. Long-term cultured cells with a high proliferation rate can be\neasily frozen and thawed when necessary, which will offer a good basis for\nuse. However, the primary cells can benefit from maintaining interactions and\nfunctional properties between primary cells. A major task in secondary cell\nculture is that they have the same properties as primary cells [18]. In vitro\ntoxicity assessment and screening were widely used in cell lines due to their\nsimple availability and cost effectiveness. Primary cell cultures have been\ncriticized for the fact that they may experience significant genotype and\nphenotypic mutations, and the karyotype changes have an impact on gene\nexpression and function [23] (Table 1).\n\n**Table 1.** Examples of primary cell culture listed in this paper.\n\n**Table 1.** Examples of primary cell culture listed in this paper.\n\nReference| Species| Tissue|

tissues of different origins includes three-\ndimensional organoid microstructures that may mimic conditions in vivo. Direct\nmeasurements of oxygen gradients in a spheroid culture system were used in\nelectron parametric resonance oximetry, which provides an elegant, widely\napplicable approach to directly characterize spheroid (and another organoid)\ncultures in biomedical and toxicological research [112]. In another\napplication in retinal organoids, the cell\u2013cell interactions are necessary to\ninvestigate the formation of retinal layers. The dissociated zebrafish retinal\nprogenitors were cultured in agarose microwells, forming tight retinal\norganoids within these wells [113].\n\nCell lines, especially stem cells, have always been the first choice for cell-\nlevel research due to their advantages of easy culture, variety, and\nconsiderable yield. It is noteworthy that some cell lines have been involved\nin important milestones, such as the pioneering work on stem cells in the\nmedaka model [114,115,116].\n\n##  5\\. Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the review emphasizes the significance of fish primary cell\nculture as a powerful tool for profiling the physiological roles of fish\ncells. The utilization of fish primary cell culture techniques has previously\nfacilitated the identification of emerging viruses and is now extensively\nemployed in research on environmental toxicology, immunology, fish physiology,\nand germplasm conservation. This technique has revolutionized our\nunderstanding of cellular processes in fish species, enabling researchers to\ninvestigate cellular responses, unravel intricate molecular mechanisms, and\nexplore novel avenues for fish health management, aquaculture optimization,\nand environmental risk assessment.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to standardize and diversify fish primary cell\nseparation technology and cell culture conditions for the optimal application\nof fish cells. Cell culture technology has permeated every facet of life\nscience and holds immense potential for further development.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization and writing, L.H., C.Z. and Q.C.; language modification and\npolishing, Q.X., J.Z. and H.L.; funding acquisition, J.J. and Q.C.
