Blockchain Development\n\n# What is Blockchain-as-a-Service & its Business Benefits?\n\nchirag January 23, 2024\n\nThe real-world applications of Blockchain are expanding by the minute. It has\nextensive real world applications and benefits but the digital businesses are\nstill struggling to leverage the true potential of Blockchain solutions. Now\nthere are two possible questions that stand in front of business owners.\n\n  * Is Blockchain-as-a-service a workable solution? \n  * Is Blockchain-as-a-service for business the answer of how to make Blockchain technology accessible to an audience?\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the BaaS solution for business\nworks, the benefits of blockchain as a service, and how to choose the best\nBaaS providers operative in the market today.\n\n## **What is Blockchain-as-a-service?**\n\nFor offering the benefits of Blockchain based services to a wider audience,\nthe technology has started being offered in the cloud as a service business\nmodel. On the operational front, it is more or less similar to the SaaS, PaaS,\nand IaaS models which enables using cloud-based apps and storage.\n\nIt allows businesses of all types and sizes to access Blockchain based\ntechnologies without investing in the in-house development. The BaaS model\nenables companies to access the Blockchain provider\u2019s service wherein they can\ndevelop Blockchain applications at minimal cost. This benefit is what has made\nit a key part of the Blockchain technology trends.\n\nThe only limitation of the BaaS solution for business is that it asks for a\ncertain level of centralization since the transactions have to be funneled\nthrough the host\u2019s Blockchain services. And because the answer to how\nBlockchain is used in business lies at the center of decentralization,\ncompanies tend to be wary of its adoption.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n  * Blockchain-as-a-Service is third party cloud infrastructure and management that businesses use for developing and managing Blockchain applications.\n  * It operates as a web host which runs an app\u2019s backend.\n  * BaaS acts as a catalyst which leads to widespread adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\n## **How Does Blockchain-as-a-Service Business Model Work?**\n\nBlockchain-as-a-service business model describes the process through which\nthird parties install, host, and maintain a Blockchain network on the behalf\nof organizations. The service provider offers the setting up of Blockchain\ninfrastructure and technology in return for fees.\n\nIn many ways, the role of Blockchain-as-a-service for business is similar to\nthat of a web hosting provider. It enables customers to make use of the cloud\nbased solutions for developing and hosting Blockchain applications and smart\ncontracts in the ecosystem managed by the provider.\n\nHere is a visual showcasing the working of Hyperledger Cello Blockchain-as-a-\nService, which is a BaaS-like Blockchain module utility system and toolkit\nunder the Hyperledger project.\n\nThe BaaS integration in traditional business provides support around\nallocation of resources, bandwidth management, data security features, and\nhosting requirements. The biggest impact of BaaS on business is that the\nenterprises can concentrate on their main business without thinking of the\ncomplexities around Blockchain operation.\n\n## **How Blockchain-as-a-service is Shaping Businesses**\n\nAccording to MarketsandMarkets, the global BaaS size is expected to grow to\nUSD 11,519 million by 2026 which is a fortune for modern enterprises.\nBlockchain-as-a-service is exclusively shaping startups and SMEs that are\nhighly dependent on large data silos. BaaS comes with the package of smart\ndata protection and competitive advantage, not to forget the expelling third\nparty delegates part. This acts as a benefit over cost. Coming back to BaaS in\nthe market, below are the global figures.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are adapting to Blockchain technology. However, the\noperational overhead cost related to development, configuration, operation,\nand maintenance of infrastructure along with the technical issues act as a\nbarrier. The advantages of Blockchain for SMEs, no matter how massive, are\nvery resource intensive and energy consuming \u2013 thus preventing the\ntechnology\u2019s mass adoption.  \n\nRenting a Blockchain infrastructure in BaaS allows businesses to acquire the\nskills needed for operating the Blockchain infrastructure. Additionally, the\ninvestment needed for entering the technology segment is also lowered, since\nthe service agreement can be easily scaled up or even terminated within short\nnotice.\n\nIt offers a way for businesses to stay at the edge of technology without any\nunnecessary risks.\n\n### **BaaS for startups**\n\nThe opportunities of BaaS for businesses, especially small businesses, is\ndeemed ideal for organizations which outsource the technological aspects, and\nare not very hands-down involved with the Blockchain\u2019s working mechanism. It\nenables these firms to get the understanding of the technology without having\nto develop their proprietary Blockchain.\n\nThe integration of BaaS solutions is being used by a number of industries for\nthings like identity management, supply chain management, and payments.\nBlockchain development services are emerging as the ideal solution for a\nnumber of SME challenges like elimination of middlemen, lack of transparency,\netc.\n\n## **Industry wise use cases of Blockchain-as-a-service  **\n\nAs we mentioned above, Blockchain is a data management platform which means\nall the solutions offered in the territory of Blockchain  will have data\nkeeping to their center. The use cases explained below exhibit how Blockchain\nis utilized by different businesses for immunity and transparency purposes.\n\n### **1\\. Healthcare  **\n\nBlockchain has revolutionized healthcare upto a great extent by keeping a\nuniversal and transparent version of patients medical data. Blockchain\ntechnology has helped several medical professionals to provide instant care to\nthe individual patients due to organized and updated records.\n\nBesides, Blockchain also aids in identifying the authenticity of medicines.\nThis means any drug or chemical can be checked to its source. This has been a\ngreat benefit for manufacturers recalling particular chemicals for aid drugs.\n\n### **2\\. Automotive  **\n\nThe biggest challenge for automotive industries is to resist counterfeit parts\nand manage supply chains. Blockchain platform as a service rescues here by\noffering end-to-end accessible records for transporting automotive parts. This\nhelps the automobile enterprises track and differentiate genuine spares from\nfakes.\n\nMoreover, Blockchain services in supply chain and manufacturing have disrupted\nthe efficient flow in the industry. There is no shortage of vital parts and\nbusinesses get optimal production with minimal setbacks.\n\n### **3\\. FinTech  **\n\nBlockchain in FinTech has brought peace to every average banking customer by\nmaking most of the financial process effortless, including AML and KYC\nverification process. Besides adding immutability and transparency to prevent\ndisputes. Blockchain services have introduced smart cards to customers. These\nsmartcards help in faster settlements of funds without the verification by any\ncentral authority.\n\n### **4\\. Transportation and logistics**  \n\nThe logistics and transportation industry relies heavily on identity\nverification for goods and passengers respectively. With a single\nidentification token, the entire process gets easy and quick for passengers.\nSimilarly for cargo movement and verification efficiency and fault proof.\n\nBlockchain platform as-a-service provides a fail-safe mechanism for industries\nand various other data silos.\n\nApart from the industry specific use cases, you can also use Blockchain\ndevelopment services for general purposes such as:\n\n### **5\\. Document tracking  **\n\nBlockchain technology offers a distributed, immutable document tracking\nsystem. By keeping the documents on Blockchain, all the participants are given\nequal access to the information. Additionally, Blockchain technology is\nimmutable, thus ensuring that the documents are secured.\n\n### **6\\. Data storage  **\n\nWith the data stored in the decentralized Blockchain, the amount of data loss\nrisk is reduced by manifold. The regulated industries like healthcare, real\nestate, etc benefit a lot from this immutable, secure facility of data storage\non Blockchain.\n\n### **7\\. Contract execution  **\n\nUnder the smart contracts service of Blockchain, a platform is provided for\nthe contract execution which promises high transparency levels. Its\ndistributed nature implies that all the parties should be equally informed.\n\nThe benefits of Blockchain infrastructure as-a-service lies in the unraveling\nof the several use cases that are yet to emerge. It offers enterprises an\nopportunity to work on those blockchain real-world use cases without making\nany large term commitments. All they would have to do is partner with a\nBlockchain service company and then fully embrace Blockchain\u2019s capabilities.\n\nNow that we have looked into how Blockchain platform as-a-service is valuable\nfor SMEs and enterprises, let us look into its regional adoption.\n\n## **The Region Wise Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-service**\n\nThe worldwide market of BaaS is big around the US, Mexico and Canada. One\nprime reason behind this is the presence of SMEs and large businesses\noperating in the US location along with a willingness to combine the\ntechnology with the public utilities services.\n\nEurope has also been seen as the leading BaaS market. One of the major drivers\nof Blockchain and BaaS adoption has been the government support from different\ncountries.\n\nThe Asia Pacific (APAC) region is the third-most biggest market for BaaS\nintegration. Driven by the BaaS integration in traditional businesses and\ngrowing investment in Japan, China, and South Korea, the technology is poised\nto grow in the region.\n\nTo take the adoption of Blockchain platform as-a-service for business further,\na number of tech companies have emerged as BaaS providers. Here are a few of\nthem:\n\n## The Top Blockchain-as-a-service Providers\n\n[Read: How to Choose Blockchain-as-a-Service Provider?]\n\n## **A Look Into the Alternative \u2013 Self-hosted Blockchain**\n\nUp until this point, we have looked in the BaaS ecosystem and how Blockchain\ninfrastructure as-a-service is influencing the small business, in addition to\nthe list of top providers. While it all suggests that it is a good option to\ngo with this approach, businesses can in fact lose out on the essence of\ndecentralization \u2013 the foundation of Blockchain fundamentals.\n\nSo what is the alternative? The answer is Self-Hosted Blockchain.\n\nWhen we talk about the Self-Hosted Blockchain app cost, the ownership amount\ntends to be a lot higher because of the startup costs, retirement costs, and\noperational costs. Moreover, the amount of developing and deploying a smart\ncontract under this model can amount to up to hundred thousand dollars or\nmore.\n\nIn contrast, a Blockchain app hosted on cloud as a BaaS offering can be around\n$0.29 per allocated CPU hour. This means, businesses would only have to pay as\nthey go and only for the service units used.\n\nWhile we are talking about choosing Blockchain services, you must also\nconsider checking \u201cHow to choose a Blockchain platform that speeds your\ngrowth\u201d.\n\nIf you are worried about the cost factor, The costs of the BaaS model vary on\nfactors such as number of concurrent transactions, transaction rate, and the\npayload size on transactions, etc. However to get a specific range and\nunderstand Blockchain development services, you can check out, \u201chow to\ndetermine Blockchain app development cost\u201d.\n\n## How can Appinventiv help you with Blockchain development services?\n\nAppinventiv is a Blockchain development company with profound knowledge and\nexperience in developing and managing decentralized solutions.
