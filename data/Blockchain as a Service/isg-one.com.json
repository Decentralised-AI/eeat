With the\nwidespread rollout of 5G and fiber-to-the-x (FTTx), growth in data traffic\ncontinues unabated. Enterprises are balancing variety, accessibility and\nquality of content with freemium models. Technological advancements have\nhowever reduced data carriage costs, accommodating users in a regulated\nindustry where spectrum and customer attention are always scarce.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Analytics investments in data and cloud are the cornerstones for deploying\nand scaling Generative AI\n\nThe year 2022 left a marked impact on the global and U.S. analytics market\nwith Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) getting\nunprecedented attention and playing a substantial role in driving growth. In\n2023, enterprises and providers were making investments and taking initiatives\nto convert the GenAI hype into reality by generating the necessary momentum.\nThis momentum, with the backdrop of enterprises increasingly relying on data-\ndriven decision-making, further propelled the growth of the analytics market\nin the U.S. Ongoing economic uncertainty combined with reduced consumer\nactivity has pushed enterprises to seek new ways of generating revenue, based\non strong data-led business decisions.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Risk Management is Essential for AI and Generative Development\n\nThe recent launch of the AI Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 corporations\nand research institutions engaged in artificial intelligence (AI) development\n(including AMD, CERN, Cornell University, Dell Technologies, IBM, Intel, Linux\nFoundation, Meta, NASA, Oracle, ServiceNow and Sony Group), aims to achieve\nthe following objectives:\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Evaluating the Impact of Generative AI Benefits on GRC Practices\n\nGovernance, risk management and compliance are essential tactics for a\nsuccessful organization. Effective GRC practices help organizations achieve\nbusiness objectives, mitigate risks and ensure compliance with laws and\nregulations. As a chief information officer or IT leader, it is important to\nevaluate new technologies and determine their impact on the business,\nincluding whether they fit within the scope of current GRC programs and\nprocesses.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Tap Into AI To Do More by Doing Less\n\nDoing more by doing less means using artificial intelligence and related\ntechnologies to make financial planning and analysis organizations more\nproductive. By eliminating low-value and unproductive work, AI enables FP&A\nteams to free up considerable time for more useful and consequential\nforecasting, planning, budgeting, analysis and reporting. AI isn\u2019t some far-\noff capability.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Generative AI Ushers in a New Age of Content and Model Creation\n\nGenerative AI is a class of artificial intelligence used to generate new,\nseemingly real content. Broadly speaking, AI has traditionally been used to\nidentify patterns in data and apply those patterns to categorize and predict\nbehaviors. For instance, it can organize customers into groups (or clusters)\nwith similar characteristics, or predict which customers are most likely to\nrespond to certain offers.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Automation, augmentation and autonomy are consolidating to enhance\nbusiness productivity\n\nChanging market dynamics drive the functional architecture design, including\nintelligent capabilities and human augmentation, to amplify performance. The\nperformance component has expanded beyond speed and incorporates efficiency,\nexperience and economics, directly impacting all value chain stakeholders.\nWith the introduction of emerging technologies, humanmachine augmentation can\nseamlessly manage more complex activities than ever before. The independent\nsoftware vendors (ISVs) market is evolving with the emergence of platforms\nthat connect and integrate solutions, capabilities and products to develop\nofferings specific to an industry, persona and function. This drives\ninnovation to introduce autonomy and intelligent orchestration that helps\nautomation drive changes to the next level. Once there is a clear vision and\npath for automation, augmentation and autonomy, businesses aim to extract\nintelligence and build visualization panes that present actionable\ninformation. This enterprise intelligence visualization practice is driven by\nanalytics and data sciences converging with ML on a platform-like offering to\ndrive deep business insights.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### The manufacturing industry is undergoing a major shift in the usage of\ntechnologies across the value chain\n\nThe manufacturing industry has undergone a dramatic transformation over the\nyears and more so recently. Rising inflation, regional conflicts, supply chain\nissues and talent management (attracting and retaining employees) are some\npressing issues the industry faces. Thus, companies are looking to embrace\ndigital transformation initiatives in smart manufacturing, supply chain and\naftermarket services. A recent ISG study on smart manufacturing reveals that\nproductivity improvements, cost savings and supply chain resilience are the\nbiggest motivators for starting smart manufacturing initiatives. Modern\nmanufacturing firms also need a well-defined aftermarket sales and service\nstrategy to drive CX and operational efficiency by integrating aftermarket\nofferings into core business processes.\n\nRead more\n\nResearch\n\n### Multicloud strategy and FinOps are foundational elements for migrating to\npublic cloud environments\n\nThe widespread adoption of cloud technology in the U.S. is fueling innovation\nand improving CX.
