What Is Blockchain as a Service, and How Can We Use It?\n\nBiz & Tech\n\n# What Is Blockchain as a Service, and How Can We Use It?\n\nBlockchain as a service is a low-tech, cost-viable alternative for companies\nlooking to implement blockchain in their services and products.\n\nBy Ethan Brown\n\nSolutions Architect Ethan Brown helps determine how BairesDev can bridge\nclients' tech gaps through innovative software development approaches.\n\n13 min read\n\nShare\n\n[ Hide ]Article Contents\n\nWhat Is Blockchain as a Service?\n\nUse Cases for Blockchain as a Service\n\nChallenges of Implementing Blockchain Solutions\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that stores all the information about\ncryptocurrency transactions. This means that no single person or institution\nhas control over the data. The data is also public, so anyone can see it. This\nis why it\u2019s often called a public digital ledger. And while there is more to\nit than that, it serves as a good mental image to understand how a blockchain\nworks.\n\nLeaving aside the environmental issues and the crypto scams (and trust me,\nwe\u2019ll get to it), blockchain can be used for a variety of purposes, including\ntracking ownership of assets, recording events and transactions, and verifying\nidentity \u2014 all within an easily auditable framework. The benefits of this are\nobvious: it makes it very difficult for anyone to commit fraud, and it makes\nthe system more transparent.\n\nEach entry in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,\nso it is impossible to modify any information in the blockchain without\nchanging all subsequent blocks. Accomplishing that would require an enormous\namount of computing power, and the process would almost immediately be noticed\nby users of the blockchain.\n\nBy all metrics, blockchain development are an interesting technology that\nunder the right circumstances can be implemented as a solution for your\nbusiness. And like most cloud-based services, there are plenty of options\navailable, including the blockchain as a service (BaaS) model. Let\u2019s go over\nthe basics and figure out what you stand to gain by incorporating blockchain\nin your projects.\n\n## What Is Blockchain as a Service?\n\n### Understanding Blockchain\n\nThe first blockchain was conceptualized by an anonymous person or group known\nas Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto combined established protocols such as\nHashcash and PGP to create a system that does not require any central\nauthority for transaction verification.\n\nInstead, transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and\nrecorded in a public dispersed ledger (the blockchain). Bitcoin was the first\npractical implementation of blockchain technology. Since the birth of bitcoin,\nnumerous other cryptocurrencies (such as Ethereum) have been created using\nsimilar protocols with various modifications. Blockchain technology has also\nbeen used for non-cryptocurrency applications such as decentralized data\nstorage, supply chain management, and voting systems.\n\nVerification is done traditionally through a process called proof of work\n(PoW). Here, computers work through a set of complicated mathematical problems\nin order to verify each transaction. It\u2019s a **competition-based model** in\nwhich each worker (called a miner) competes to be the first one to answer a\nproblem. The more miners trying to solve the same problem, the harder it\nbecomes. This is because each miner needs to find a unique solution in order\nfor their block of verified transactions to be accepted by the network and\nadded onto the blockchain.\n\nMiners are rewarded for their work, which incentivizes competition. And if you\npaid any attention to the world of bitcoin, you already know just how\nprofitable mining can be. Unfortunately, this competition is also one of\nblockchain\u2019s biggest concerns. Energy consumption is a key issue with proof-\nof-work systems. They require a large amount of energy to run, which can lead\nto high electricity costs. This has a major environmental impact. For example,\nthe bitcoin blockchain consumes more power than the entire country of Ireland.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t so much the amount of energy, but rather the wasted energy.\nRemember that out of all the miners, only the first one who provides the\nanswer is actually awarded; only their work mattered in the end. The rest of\nthe energy could be seen as expended on security, but the truth of the matter\nis that you only needed that first miner to validate the transaction.\n\nSome companies like Ethereum have migrated to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model in\nsearch of greener solutions. This is a system in which a cryptocurrency holder\ncan mine or validate block transactions according to how much of the currency\nthey hold. It works by allowing users to \u201cstake\u201d their coins in order to\ngenerate new blocks and receive a reward.\n\nThe more coins you stake, the greater your chances of generating a new block\nand receiving the associated reward. You can lose your stake if you are found\nto be validating fraudulent transactions or if the network forks and you end\nup on the wrong side of the fork. As such, miners are motivated to act in the\nbest interests of the network.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk a bit more about PoW versus PoS when we discuss the challenges of\nBaaS solutions. But for now, just keep in mind that this is a choice you have\nto eventually make.\n\n### Understanding \u201cAs a Service\u201d Solutions\n\nEverything as a service (XaaS) is a model in which businesses can access\ntechnology-enabled services over the internet. The term is often used to\ndescribe data backup, storage, and recovery services. But it can cover almost\nevery conceivable technical solution that can be delivered as a service via\nthe web. What makes XaaS stand out is its pay-per-use model \u30fc businesses only\npay for the services they use, when they need them.\n\nXaaS is a cloud-based solution that delivers on-demand access to software and\nother digital resources over the internet. XaaS represents an alternative to\ntraditional IT models in which companies purchase hardware, install it on\nsite, and then manage it themselves. With XaaS, all of those functions are\noutsourced to third-party providers who deliver them as needed through the\ncloud.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no upfront investment in hardware or software licenses, XaaS\ncan offer considerable cost savings compared with traditional IT models \u30fc\nespecially for small businesses that don\u2019t have their own dedicated IT staff.\nThe pay-as-you go pricing model also makes XaaS attractive to cash-strapped\nstartups and other organizations with limited budgets. And because most XaaS\nsolutions are based on subscription plans, businesses can cancel or scale back\ntheir services at any time without incurring hefty termination fees \u30fc another\nadvantage over traditional IT arrangements where customers often find\nthemselves locked into long-term contracts.\n\n### Putting It all Together\n\nBlockchain as a service (BaaS) is a cloud-based service that allows companies\nto build and operate their own blockchain applications. BaaS is based on the\nsoftware as a service (SaaS) model and works in a similar fashion. It allows\ncustomers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host, and operate their\nown blockchain apps and related functions on the blockchain.\n\nAt the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure\n**agile and operational**. As a development in the greater blockchain\necosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting blockchain adoption across businesses.\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:\n\n**Microsoft** : Microsoft\u2019s blockchain solution allows developers to create,\ndeploy, and manage blockchain applications on the Azure platform. The service\noffers a variety of features that make it easy to develop and deploy\nblockchain applications, including templates for popular blockchain\nframeworks, integration with Azure services such as Active Directory and Key\nVault, and support for multiple programming languages.\n\n**Amazon** : AWS provides purpose-built tools to support your distinct needs,\nwhether you need a centralized ledger database that maintains an immutable and\ncryptographically verifiable record of transactions, or a multi-party, fully\nmanaged blockchain network that helps eliminate intermediaries. More customers\ntrust AWS for their blockchain and ledger technology workloads than any other\ncloud vendor. As much as 25% of Ethereum workloads operate on AWS. Enterprise\ncustomers for Hyperledger Fabric include Nestle, Sony Music, BMW, Sage,\nGuardian, DTCC, Workday, Klarna Bank, SGX, Legal & General, and Splunk.\n\n**R3:** The R3 consortium launched a BaaS platform called Corda Enterprise in\n2015. This solution is based on open source technology (but keep in mind that\nis not open source itself). This solution is designed for use in mission-\ncritical environments such as banking and other highly regulated industries.\nIt features enhanced security, scalability, and performance compared to the\nopen source version of Corda. In addition, it comes with support for\nenterprise applications such as identity management, compliance monitoring,\nand auditing.\n\n**Paystand** : Paystand is a company that provides a more efficient way to\nmanage transactions for businesses. They aim to eliminate fees, digitize the\ncash cycle, and create a self-driving money experience for businesses. The\ncompany was founded in 2013 by Jeremy Almond and Scott Campbell. Inspired by\npioneers taking sales and marketing into the cloud to become faster and more\nefficient, it touts itself as \u201cThe first Ethereum-based hybrid blockchain\ndesigned for B2B.\u201d\n\n## Use Cases for Blockchain as a Service\n\n### Track and Trace\n\nTrack and trace is a system that allows you to follow the history of a product\nas it moves through the supply chain. This is important because it can help\ncombat issues like counterfeit goods, compliance violations, delays, and\nwaste. With a blockchain solution, entire networks of a supply chain can\ndocument updates to a single shared ledger, which provides total data\nvisibility and a single source of truth.\n\n### Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement\nbetween buyer and seller directly written into lines of code. The code and the\nagreements contained therein exist within the blockchain network. Smart\ncontracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among\ndisparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal\nsystem, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable,\ntransparent, and irreversible.\n\nFor example, a smart contract could be used to automatically transfer\nownership of a piece of property when certain conditions are met, such as the\nexpiration of a lease. Smart contracts could also be used to enforce the\nperformance of certain obligations, such as making payments on time or\nadhering to quality standards.\n\n### Personal Identity Security\n\nThe use of blockchain technology can help to secure personal identity\ninformation. Blockchain provides a distributed database that is tamper-\nresistant and can be used to store sensitive information. This data can be\naccessed by authorized parties, but it cannot be modified or deleted. This\nmakes blockchain an ideal platform for storing and managing personal identity\ndata. Additionally, the use of smart contracts (as mentioned above) on the\nblockchain can further enhance the security of this data by providing a way to\nverify and enforce the terms of agreements related to the personal identity.\n\n### Logistics\n\nThe application of blockchain technology in the logistics industry can help to\nstreamline supply chains and make them more efficient. For example,\nblockchain-based smart contracts can be used to automate the process of\ntracking shipments and payments. This can help to reduce costs and improve\ntransparency. In addition, blockchain-based systems can be used to track the\nprovenance of goods, which can help to ensure that they are not counterfeit or\nstolen.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe use of blockchain technology in government is still in its early stages,\nbut there are a number of potential applications that could have a significant\nimpact on the way governments operate. One area where blockchain could be\nparticularly useful is in tracking and managing government benefits programs.\nBy using blockchain to track benefits payments, the government could reduce\nfraud and improve transparency.\n\nAdditionally, blockchain-based smart contracts could be used to automate the\ndelivery of benefits payments, making the process more efficient. Another area\nwhere blockchain could have an impact is in land registry systems. By using\nblockchain to track ownership and transfer of land titles, governments could\nreduce corruption and increase transparency.\n\n## Challenges of Implementing Blockchain Solutions\n\nThe challenges of implementing blockchain solutions are numerous and varied.\nThey include:\n\n  1. **Technical challenges** : Blockchain is a new and complex technology. Developing and deploying blockchain-based applications can be difficult and time-consuming.\n\nFortunately, as mentioned above, services like AWS and Azure have some amazing\nblueprints to facilitate the development process. Of course, familiarization\nis still an issue, but as we all know, frameworks can be a great first step\ntoward learning and implementing new technology.\n\n  2. **Organizational challenges:** Organizations must overcome various cultural, political, and organizational barriers to implement blockchain solutions successfully.\n\nEnvironmental concerns are a prime example of one such issue. Proof of stake\nis offering a more eco-friendly alternative to proof of work, and there are\nother methods for companies to offset their carbon footprint. It\u2019s important\nfor organizations to understand the green policies from service providers and\nmake a decision based on their environmental goals.\n\n  3. **Regulatory challenges:** Blockchain technology is currently unregulated in most jurisdictions. This can make it difficult for organizations to comply with existing regulations when using blockchain technology. \n\nTo be fair, this will probably change as people begin to disentangle\nblockchain from cryptocurrency. While the two technologies are intertwined,\nthey are not the same thing. Blockchain is inherently a neutral technology.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s important to understand the regulations in each region and\nadapt your strategy to that market.\n\n  4. **Interoperability challenges:** Blockchains are often designed to be interoperable with other blockchains or systems. However, this can be difficult to achieve in practice due to the different technical standards used by different blockchains.\n\nAs blockchain solutions and service providers change and adapt, we can expect\nmore defined standards and better APIs for interoperability. The good news is\nthat not every enterprise requires interoperability to implement a blockchain\nsolution.\n\n  5. **Security challenges:** Blockchains are often touted as being more secure than traditional databases, but they are not immune to security risks. Organizations must carefully consider the security implications of using blockchain technology before deployment. \n\nBlockchains are extremely resilient against brute force attacks, but less\ndirect methods like social engineering are still a liability. As with any\ncloud technology, it has to go hand in hand with a set of best practices to\nprevent cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n  6. **Privacy challenges:** Blockchains are often public and transparent by design. This can pose privacy challenges for organizations that need to keep certain data confidential. \n\nOf course, not every bit of data should be added to a blockchain. For\nsensitive and personal data that you want to keep safe, it\u2019s better to use the\ngood old-fashioned siloed server. Having said that, blockchains like Corda\noffer privacy as part of their business model.\n\n  7. **Scalability challenges:** Blockchains can struggle to scale to meet the demands of large-scale applications. This can limit their usefulness in some situations. \n\nThe good news is that all BaaS providers put scalability front and center, so\nyou don\u2019t have to personally manage the scaling process. That\u2019s not to say\nthat blockchains are great for every project, but thanks to these providers it\nis easier to change and adapt as the market changes.\n\n  8. **Cost challenges** : Implementing and maintaining a blockchain solution can be costly. Organizations must carefully consider the costs and benefits of using blockchain technology before deployment.\n\nOnce again, the as a service model means that organizations pay as they go,\nonly paying for the processing power they\u2019ve used. Additionally, most service\nproviders offer budget tools like soft and hard limits, warnings, and flags to\nmanage your expenses and avoid going over budget.\n\nIn conclusion, BaaS is a great way to get started with blockchain technology.\nIt allows businesses to experiment with the technology without having to\ninvest in the infrastructure themselves. Additionally, it provides a way for\nbusinesses to outsource the management of their blockchain applications. This\nprovides a way for businesses to focus on their core competencies while still\ntaking advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, be sure to check out our other articles about\nBlockchain Technology:\n\n  * How to Create Cryptocurrency \u2013 7 Easy Steps\n  * Web 4.0?
