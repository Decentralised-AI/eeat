As blockchain application development continues to expand to uses\nbeyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain as a service becomes more in demand as a\nhosting option.\n\n  \n\nSimilar to software-as-a-service, blockchain as a service lets businesses get\napplications up and running with minimal hassle. This allows higher agility\nand quicker blockchain adoption. Blockchain applications are becoming more and\nmore desirable, but they can be challenging to set up for smaller businesses\nor organizations with limited IT resources. A blockchain-as-a-service provider\ncan provide professional assistance in addition to their hosting services.\n\n### Features of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nSome of the most common features offered in Blockchain-as-a-Service platforms\nare as follows:\n\n  * Platform architecture management\n\n  * modular, preconfigured networks and infrastructure\n\n  * Easy setup workflow\n\n  * Middleware for monitoring & development for app building\n\n  * Dashboard to view and analyze chaincode\n\n  * Auditable transaction record\n\n  * Built in connections to needed services\n\n  * Professional consultation\n\n### Blockchain as-a-service (BaaS) Comparison\n\nWhen choosing between different Blockchain-as-a-service options, the primary\nconsideration should be your use case. Many platforms specialize in the\nfinancial technology or investment space and focus on cryptocurrencies like\nbitcoin. If your goal is to support cryptocurrencies or sell NFTs, these\nfinance-focused services are a good choice. If you are trying to create a\ndifferent kind of blockchain application, you should consider other options.  \n **\n\n**\n\n### Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) Pricing\n\nPricing for blockchain-as-a-service options is highly dependent on the type of\napplication you are making, as well as how many transactions you perform if\nyour application is financial in nature. Businesses should expect to pay at\nleast $0.30 per hour for the bare minimum features. Expect to pay more for\nmore nodes, storage, and features.  \n\n## Related Categories\n\n  * App Development Platforms\n  * Cryptocurrency Mining Software\n  * Mobile App Development Software\n  * Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Solutions\n  * Digital Rights Management (DRM) Software\n  * Crypto Accounting Software\n  * Crypto Tax Software\n  * FinTech Software\n  * Crypto Asset Management Software\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n  * What Businesses Benefit Most from Blockchain-as-a-service\n  * Why is the professional consultation portion of blockchain-as-a-service important?\n  * What does blockchain-as-a-service cost?\n\n### What Businesses Benefit Most from Blockchain-as-a-service\n\nAny business that wants to leverage blockchain technology and lacks the skill\nto do so in house can benefit from a blockchain-as-a-service platform. Even\nlarger businesses should consider what their expenditure on blockchain\nmanagement is and if it would be more effective to use a blockchain-as-a-\nservice provider.\n\n### Why is the professional consultation portion of blockchain-as-a-service\nimportant?\n\nBlockchain is a rapidly growing technology, so many businesses that would\nbenefit from blockchain technologies lack the expertise to do so themselves.\nBlockchain-as-a-service platforms will help businesses get off the ground with\ntheir blockchain applications.\n\n### What does blockchain-as-a-service cost?\n\nBlockchain-as-a-service pricing is highly varied depending on the vendor. It\nis typically priced by the hour though, with costs increasing as more nodes\nare added or more storage is needed.\n\n  1. Home\n  2.
