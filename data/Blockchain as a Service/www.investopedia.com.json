These third-party services are a relatively new development in\nthe growing field of blockchain technology. The application of blockchain\ntechnology has moved well beyond its best-known use in cryptocurrency\ntransactions and has broadened to address secure transactions of all kinds. As\na result, there is a demand for hosting services.\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) refers to third-party cloud-based infrastructure and management for companies building and operating blockchain apps.\n  * BaaS functions like a sort of web host, running the back-end operation for a block-chain based app or platform.\n  * BaaS may be the catalyst that leads to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.\n\n##  Understanding Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBaaS is based on the software as a service (SaaS) model and works in a similar\nfashion. It allows customers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host,\nand operate their own blockchain apps and related functions on the blockchain.\nAt the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure\nagile and operational.\n\nAs a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting\nblockchain adoption across businesses.\n\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:\n\n  * Microsoft partnered with ConsenSys to introduce Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service on Microsoft Azure in 2015.1\n  * Amazon has introduced Amazon Managed Blockchain, a service that \"makes it easy to create and manage scalable blockchain networks\" using open-source frameworks, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.2\n  * R3, a consortium of global financial institutions that produced a distributed financial ledger called Corda.3\n  * PayStand, which specializes in sending and receiving payments between companies.4\n\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly willing to adapt to blockchain\ntechnology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead\ninvolved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining\nits infrastructure often act as a barrier.\n\nBaaS offers an external service provider to set up all the necessary\nblockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. Once created, the provider\ncontinues to handle the complex back-end operations for the client.\n\nThe BaaS operator typically offers support activities, such as bandwidth\nmanagement, suitable allocation of resources, hosting requirements, and data\nsecurity features. The BaaS operator frees the client to focus on the core\njob: the functionality of the blockchain.\n\n##  Example of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)\n\nBelow is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service\nHyperledger Cello, a BaaS-like blockchain module toolkit and utility system\nunder the Hyperledger project.\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2020\n\nIn fact, a BaaS\u2019 provider's role is similar to that of a web hosting provider.\nThe website creators create and run all the website content on their own\npersonal computers. They may hire support staff or sign up with an external\nhosting provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party\ncompanies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.\n\nBaaS may be the catalyst that leads to a wider and deeper penetration of\nblockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead\nof creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can\nnow simply outsource the technically complex work and focus on its core\nactivities.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.\nThese include white papers, government data, original reporting, and\ninterviews with industry experts.
