European Blockchain Services Infrastructure \n\n# European Blockchain Services Infrastructure\n\nThe European public sector is building its own blockchain services\ninfrastructure, which should soon be interoperable with private sector\nplatforms.\n\n\u00a9 Image by Shutter2U - iStock Getty Images\n\nThe European blockchain services infrastructure (EBSI) consists of a peer-to-\npeer network of interconnected nodes running a blockchain-based services\ninfrastructure. Each member of the **European Blockchain Partnership** (EBP) \u2013\nthe 27 EU countries, Norway, Liechtenstein and the European Commission \u2013 will\nrun at least one node.\n\nThe infrastructure is made up of different layers including:\n\n  * a base layer containing the basic infrastructure, connectivity, the blockchain and necessary storage;\n  * a core services layer that will enable all EBSI-based use cases and applications; \n  * additional layers dedicated to use cases and specific applications.\n\nIt will allow public organisations to develop applications that connect to and\nmake use of the EBSI infrastructure. Eventually, it will be extended to\nprivate organisations.\n\n## EBSI use cases and roadmap\n\nBy design, EBSI is being built in an iterative manner, focusing on a small\nnumber of specific use cases (applications), and then expanding them over\ntime.\n\nThe initial set of EBSI use cases are:\n\n  * **notarisation** : Leveraging the power of blockchain to create trusted digital audit trails, automate compliance checks in time-sensitive processes and prove data integrity;\n  * **diplomas** : Giving control back to citizens when managing their education credentials,  significantly reducing verification costs and improving authenticity trust;\n  * **European digital identity** : Implementing a generic digital identity capability, allowing users to create and control their own identity across borders without relying on centralised authorities, and enabling for compliance with the eIDAS regulatory framework;\n  * **trusted data sharing** : Leveraging blockchain technology to securely share data amongst authorities in the EU, starting with the IOSS VAT identification numbers and import one-stop-shops amongst customs and tax authorities.\n\nEBSI will be enriched by other use cases.\n\nCurrently the EBP is working on three additional use cases that will be added\nto EBSI in future steps (after mid 2021). These concern:\n\n  * financing small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) through blockchain;\n  * leveraging European social security numbers to facilitate cross border access to welfare services;\n  * facilitating the management of cross-border and cross-authority asylum demand processes.\n\nMoreover, once EBSI is in full production, private companies and organisations\nwill be able to join EBSI as a utility. This should, among other things, open\nup significant opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies in interactions\nand transactions between the public and private sectors.\n\nTo prepare for future capacities of EBSI and to support new types of use\ncases, the European Commission launched a pre-commercial procurement action.\nIt started through an open market consultation and a call for tender.\nInterested market parties are invited to consult the European Blockchain Pre-\nCommercial Procurement web pages.\n\nMore on EBSI\n\nFollow the latest progress and learn more about getting involved.\n\n  * Follow the Commission's work on tech and digital @DigitalEU\n\n## Latest News\n\nNEWS ARTICLE | 26 January 2024\n\nApplications are now open for the second cohort of the European Blockchain\nSandbox\n\nThe European Blockchain Sandbox has opened its second round of calls for\ninnovative use cases involving Distributed Ledger Technologies.\n\nPRESS RELEASE | 27 September 2023\n\nFirst report on the State of the Digital Decade calls for collective action to\nshape the digital transition\n\nThe first report on the State of the Digital Decade, published earlier this\nweek, provides a comprehensive look at progress towards achieving the digital\ntransformation to empower a more digitally sovereign, resilient, and\ncompetitive EU.\n\nNEWS ARTICLE | 06 September 2023\n\nEuropean Blockchain Sandbox announces the selected projects for the first\ncohort\n\nThe European Commission, Bird and Bird and OXYGY have announced 20 use-cases\nfor the first cohort of the European Blockchain Sandbox.\n\nPRESS RELEASE | 15 June 2023\n\nDigital Assembly 2023 kicks off focusing on a digital, open and secure Europe\n\nThe Commission hosted, together with the Swedish Presidency of the Council of\nthe EU, the Digital Assembly 2023 in Stockholm.\n\nBrowse Blockchain\n\n## Related Content\n\n### Big Picture\n\nBlockchain Strategy\n\nThe EU wants to be a leader in blockchain technology, becoming an innovator in\nblockchain and a home to significant platforms, applications and companies.\n\n### See Also\n\nBlockchain funding and investment\n\nThe EU provides funding for blockchain research and innovation through grants\nand prizes and by supporting investment.\n\nLegal and regulatory framework for blockchain\n\nThe European Commission recognises the importance of legal certainty and a\nclear regulatory regime in areas pertaining to blockchain-based applications.\n\nBlockchain for climate action\n\nThe European Commission aims to use innovations in blockchain technologies to\nhelp fight climate change.\n\nBlockchain standards\n\nThe European Commission takes an active role in the blockchain standards\ncommunity, engaging and working closely with all relevant bodies around the\nworld.\n\nEuropean Blockchain Partnership\n\nThe European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) is an initiative to develop an EU\nstrategy on blockchain and build a blockchain infrastructure for public\nservices.\n\nEU Blockchain Observatory and Forum\n\nThe EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum facilitates dialogue between decision\nmakers, thought leaders, and the blockchain community.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Last update\n\n7 June 2022\n\n* * *\n\n__Print as PDF\n\n## Shaping Europe\u2019s digital future\n\nThis site is managed by: Directorate-General for Communications Networks,\nContent and Technology\n\n## Contact us\n\n  * Contact DG CONNECT\n\n## Follow us\n\n  * Digital EU on Facebook\n  * Digital EU on Instagram\n  * Digital EU on LinkedIn\n  * Digital EU on Youtube\n  * @DigitalEU on Twitter\n\n## About us\n\n  * Privacy statement\n  * Copyright notice\n  * About Directorate-General CONNECT\n  * Language Policy\n  * Accessibility statement\n\n  * Contact the European Commission\n  * Follow the European Commission on social media\n  * Resources for partners\n\n  * Language policy\n  * Cookies\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Legal notice\n\nBack to top\n\n",
