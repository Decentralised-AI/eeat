These solutions provide management\nand infrastructure for blockchain applications that run critical back-end\noperations, similar to other cloud hosted SaaS applications. BaaS solutions\nare a relatively new category of products, but are quickly growing in\npopularity as a way for organizations to quickly adopt and build blockchain\napplications.  BaaS solutions simplify the process of adopting blockchain for\norganizations of all sizes, particularly those that have limited expertise in\nthe blockchain ecosystem.\n\nUsing a BaaS solution is often much quicker and more cost effective than\nbuilding and operating a blockchain application from the ground up. As they\nare cloud-based tools, they can be very quickly deployed, and the Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) business model means that teams can easily manage payments\nand track costs. The technical complexity around blockchain is that there is a\nhigh barrier for organizations looking to invest in blockchain technologies,\neither for tracking cryptocurrency transactions or other use cases. BaaS is\nmaking blockchain far more accessible to organizations of all sizes and\nskillsets. BaaS providers offer the tools, support, and resources needed to\ncreate, maintain, and scale blockchain networks with ease.\n\nAs the demand for blockchain applications continues to increase, the BaaS\nmarket is becoming more competitive. In this article we\u2019ll outline some of the\ntop blockchain services available today, considering key features such as\narchitecture management, app building, and managed services to help you\ncompare BaaS solutions. This list will be regularly updated as new products\ncome to market and the current leaders consolidate their offerings.\n\nThe Top Blockchain-As-A-Service Solutions include:\n\nAlchemy Enterprise Amazon Managed Blockchain Chainstack Hosting ConsenSys\nQuorum IBM Blockchain Kaleida Blockchain as a Service Oracle Blockchain\nPlatform Cloud Service\n\n### Alchemy Enterprise\n\nAlchemy Enterprise is a developer platform that enables businesses to create\nscalable and reliable decentralized applications, without the need for\nmanaging blockchain infrastructure in-house.

Each block, or cell, in the database contains\ninformation and a header which is encrypted and given a hash. This is then\nentered into the header of the next block of the data base to create a linked\nchain of information across all blocks. This is a highly secure way of storing\ninformation, as if a single block is altered, the entire chain would be\ndisrupted. This means if a copy is altered on one network, it would be clearly\nobvious to the other computers on the network that the chain didn\u2019t match.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as with everything, blockchain isn\u2019t 100% secure.\nIf multiple copies are altered at once, or a majority of the copies on a\nnetwork are edited, then it can be possible for the data to become\ncompromised. This is exceptionally difficult however, due to the speed at\nwhich the blockchain hashing process takes place.\n\nBlockchain is best known for its application in cryptocurrency, specifically\nbitcoin. Bitcoin uses blockchain to database payments between different\nparties directly, with no intermediary such as a bank processing the\ntransactions. However, blockchain does have wider applications than just\ncryptocurrency as it can be used to record any data electronically and\nsecurely. This could include public IDs, electoral votes, or library systems\nfor example.\n\nBlockchain technology has been increasingly adopted to improve security,\ntransparency, and efficiency across industries. The benefits range from\nstreamlining supply chain operations to enhancing data protection and reducing\nfraudulent activities.\n\n### What Are Blockchain-As-A-Service (BaaS) Solutions?\n\nBlockchain-As-A-Service (BaaS) solutions are cloud platforms that allow teams\nto easily create and manage bitcoin applications. They enable customers to\nhost, build, and operate blockchain applications, with monitoring\nfunctionalities and managed support services. BaaS works on the SaaS model,\nwith monthly or annual billing, or pay-as-you-use functionality. Organizations\ndon\u2019t have to worry about building or operating their own infrastructure and\ncan easily manage and deploy cloud-based bitcoin apps.\n\nBitcoin-As-A-Service is similar to web hosting providers such as WordPress \u2013\nrather than having to build your own website from the ground up, you can\nsimply use a pre-build platform with all the features you need to quickly get\nbuilding apps.\n\n### What Are The Benefits Of Blockchain-As-A-Service?\n\nSetting up a blockchain can be a highly technical and complex task. Many\norganizations simply don\u2019t have the resources to invest in building their own\nblockchain, but still wish to use the technologies for hosting immutable data\nor investing in cryptocurrency. Blockchain-As-A-Service provides all the\ninfrastructure and management capabilities needed for organizations and teams\nto build their own bitcoin apps.\n\n### What Features Should You Look For In Blockchain as a Service Solutions?\n\nBlockchain-As-A-Service is a relatively new product category, and the\nsolutions are, therefore, continuing to develop new capabilities and\nfunctionality. However, the key functionality of a BaaS solution is to build\nand run bitcoin apps, so here are some key features to consider:\n\n  * **Customizable and pre-built blockchain applications** : The ability to quickly build and customize blockchain applications\n  * **Architecture management:** The ability to manage blockchain app architecture and hosting along with bandwidth and resource allocations\n  * **Security controls and app monitoring** : The ability to monitor apps and proactively detect security vulnerabilities\n  * **Management console:** An intuitive management console with dashboards and reports to analyze code\n  * **Managed services:** Some BaaS solutions will offer managed support and app building services\n  * **Audits and logs:** Auditing is important to track records and spend across blockchain applications\n\n* * *\n\nJoel Witts\n\nContent Director\n\nJoel Witts is the Content Director at Expert Insights, meaning he oversees all\narticles published and topics covered.
