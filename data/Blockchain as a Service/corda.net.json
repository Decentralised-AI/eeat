Use cases include enhanced\nasset lifecycle management, new means to capital formation, instant\nsettlement, and the ability to unlock liquidity in previously illiquid\nmarkets.\n\n##### ****Settlement finality****\n\nCorda\u2019s consensus model guarantees that assets have deterministic settlement\nfinality.\n\n##### **Native smart contracts**\n\nModel digital assets on ledger, eliminate data reconciliation, and automate\nbusiness processes.\n\n##### ****Regulatory compliant****\n\nGrounded in existing legal constructs and compatible with existing and\nemerging regulation such as ISO 20022 and ISDA CDM.\n\n##### ****Native interoperability****\n\nCorda lays the foundation for native interoperability, while CorDapp users can\nexchange value from one Corda network to another with privacy, security, and\ncontrol.\n\n#### **Frictionless exchange of data and assets**\n\nEnable the negotiation, creation, and seamless exchange of high-value data,\ndigital assets, and smart contracts among counterparties where large degrees\nof coordination and trust are critical.\n\n#### **Model digital assets across the lifecycle**\n\nDevelop solutions powered by the best-of-breed distributed ledger for\nregulated, institutional grade digital asset issuance, trading, and\nsettlement.\n\n#### ****Composable** building blocks**\n\nA modularized development framework that enables you to use only the\ncapabilities you need, when you need them.\n\n#### **Automate business logic**\n\nStreamline inter-firm automation across a business network and orchestrate\ncomplex multi-party workflows with resilience.\n\n#### **Integrates easily with existing systems**\n\nCorda uses standard sets of technologies such as HTTPs, X509 and RESTful APIs\nto enable deployment and integration with the enterprise ecosystem, and\ncompliance with enterprise security policy.\n\n###\n\nCorda is developed and supported by R3, a leading provider  \nof enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) and services that enable the\nsecure exchange of value in regulated industries where trust is critical.\n\n## **The power of connected distributed networks**\n\nCorda enables open and secure transactions at scale, ideal for financial\nmarkets.\n\n#### **Single identity with mutual memberships**\n\nCorda provides the ability to maintain identities across all Corda-based\nnetworks and ensures all CorDapp identities are tied to a legal entity\nreducing security risks.\n\n#### **Asset fluidity**\n\nWith Corda, digital assets move freely across network boundaries using well-\ndefined trusted exchange protocols that meet regulatory demands for privacy\nand security.\n\n#### ****Open, connected networks****\n\nR3 is building interoperability to ensure Corda can act as a bridge to\nliquidity beyond the Corda ecosystem. The R3-Adhara Hyperledger Lab Harmonia\nwill further explore cross chain atomic experimentation code between an EVM-\nbased network and Corda.\n\n## **Get started**\n\n  * Get Corda\n  * Corda Fact Sheet\n  * Documentation\n\n###  Contact Us\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nJob Title\n\nCompany*\n\nPhone\n\nEmail*\n\nCountry*\n\nCountryUnited StatesUnited KingdomCanadaIndiaNetherlandsAustraliaSouth\nAfricaFranceGermanySingaporeSwitzerlandBrazilThailand\\--- All Countries Below\n---\u00c5land IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican\nSamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and\nBarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire,\nSint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet\nIslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarrussalamBulgariaBurkina\nFasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African\nRepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosDR\nCongoCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaIvory\nCoastCroatiaCura\u00e7aoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican\nRepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini\n(Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench\nGuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern\nTerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-\nBissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong\nKongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIrelandIsle of\nManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall\nIslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew\nCaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana\nIslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinePanamaPapua New\nGuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto\nRicoQatarR\u00e9unionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Barth\u00e9lemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and\nNevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the\nGrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi\nArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint\nMaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth\nKoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen\nIslandsSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-\nLesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and\nCaicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited\nStatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin\nIslands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern\nSaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\n\nComments*\n\nSign up for marketing news\n\nSign up for Corda news\n\nEmail\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\u0394\n\nContact Us\n\n  * Developer Portal\n  * Docs\n  * About R3\n  * Careers\n  * Contact\n  * Get Corda\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Trademark Policy\n  * Anti Slavery Statement\n\n  \nWe use necessary cookies to make our site work, as well as optional cookies to\nhelp us improve use of our site.
