Software development\nis a process of writing and maintaining the source code, however, it\nincorporates everything from the origination of the ideal programming to the\nlast appearance of the product, occasionally in an organized process. Software\ndevelopment may include research, new development, prototyping, modification,\nreuse, re-engineering, maintenance, and any other exercises that result in\nprogramming items.\n\nSoftware can be produced for a variety of purposes, the three most basic being\nto address explicit issues for a particular customer/business (e.g., custom\nsoftware), to meet an apparent need for potential clients (e.g., commercial\nand open-source software), or for individual use (e.g., a researcher may\ncompose programming to computerize an everyday undertaking). Embedded software\ndevelopment, which is utilized to control consumer products, requires the\ndevelopment procedure to be integrated with the development of the controlled\nphysical item.\n\nThe need for better quality control of the software development process has\ngiven rise to the software engineering discipline, which applies the\nsystematic approach of the engineering paradigm to the process of software\ndevelopment.\n\nThere are numerous ways to deal with software programming management,\nincluding software development life cycle models, philosophies, or procedures.\nA cascade model is a customary form, notable among the latest innovations of\nAgile software development.\n\n#### How to Choose a Custom Software Development Company?\n\nBelow are some tips on how to choose a software development company that will\nbe a perfect match for you!\n\nThese are the key issues to consider before you hire a software development\ncompany, based on our company\u2019s experience.\n\n  * Define your objectives, resources, and timeframe. \n  * Get referrals from people. \n  * Look at the company\u2019s portfolio. \n  * Consider the size of your software project and be aware that many custom software development companies primarily work with projects of a particular size (e.g., multi-year or multi-enterprise projects). \n  * Check out the company\u2019s technology stack. \n  * Consider these questions: \n    * Do you spot innovative technologies? \n    * What do you think of the app designs? Do they provide you with a satisfying user experience? \n    * Does the company openly share its approach or development processes for a particular target audience? \n    * Does the company have experience with software that is in any way similar to yours? \n  * Find out if you will be provided continuous support and maintenance for your app. \n  * Consider the geographical location. \n  * Emphasize good communication skills. \n  * Clarify the company\u2019s application ownership policy. \n\n####  What is Agile Software Development?\n\nAgile software development involves different ways of dealing with software\ndevelopment in which requirements and solutions evolve through the\ncollaborative efforts of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their\ncustomer(s) or end user(s). It includes adaptive planning, cutting-edge\ndevelopment, early delivery, and further maintenance, and it encourages rapid\nand flexible reactions to any changes.\n\nThe qualities and standards espoused in this manifesto were derived from and\nunderpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and\nKanban.\n\n#### What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?\n\nThe software development life cycle (SDLC) defines tasks that are performed at\neach stage in the software development process. The SDLC is a structure\nfollowed by a development team within a software company.\n\n  * **Planning:** The most important stages of software development\u2014requirement gathering or requirement analysis\u2014are usually completed by the most skilled and experienced software engineers in the organization. Once all the requirements have been gathered from the stakeholders, the next step is to determine the scope of the project and create a scope document. \n  * **Implementation:** The software engineers start coding according to the client's requirements. \n  * **Testing:** This step helps reveal defects or bugs in the created software. \n  * **Documentation:** Every project has its own documentation for every step and future reference. This helps a lot with improvements in the development process. The design documentation may include the described interface in a written form (API). \n  * **Deployment:** After it is approved, the software is released. \n  * **Maintaining:** Software maintenance is done for future reference. Software upgrades or changes can take longer than the creation of the initial software variant. \n\n#### How Much Does Custom Software Development Cost?\n\nThe price range is very broad and there are numerous aspects that contribute\nto the costs of custom software development.\n\nWhat Impacts the Cost of Custom Software?\n\nConsider the following factors when determining the costs of and creating a\nbudget for custom software development.\n\n  * **Software Size:** The more screens or pages an app has, the more work needs to be done to create an application, and the more expensive it will be to deliver. Small applications range from 10\u201325 screens, medium applications range from 25\u201340, and large applications include anything with more than 40 screens or pages. \n  * **Software Complexity:** Complicated logic takes more time to code and test. If a custom software application performs a lot of heavy analysis, scoring, or number crunching, or if a code has a lot of nuances and permutations, this complexity will require more focus and could increase the cost. \n  * **Creative Design:** Creative design in custom software development is where a customer gets to choose different fonts and color palettes, among other things. Much like when someone is designing and decorating a house, the more extravagant the design needs and wants, the more expensive the costs tend to be. \n  * **Integration With Other Systems:** Integrating with other systems introduces a lot of unknown variables into the final cost. Sometimes the integrations are effortless, but sometimes they are extremely difficult. Typical integrations, such as popular payment providers or credit check services, are easy to integrate. However, older or lesser-known systems may pose a challenge and increase the project cost and duration. \n  * **Migration of Existing Data:** If you have data in an existing system that needs to be moved into a new application, assuming it is more than someone can feasibly type in by hand, then it will require migration. Migration is nothing more than custom scripts that take data out of an old system, dust it off, and reshape it so it can fit into the new system. The steps of this process are fairly straight-forward, but there are a lot of questions and decisions that need to be made since the two systems will store the data differently. Migration is run a few times after the software is completed to make sure everything has been translated correctly and the new system is using the data as desired. The time spent on figuring out the translation rules, writing the scripts, and performing tests and adjustments will add to the project duration and costs. \n\n#### How Long Does It Take to Build a Custom Software?\n\nOn average, software development time can vary from 3 to 9 months, depending\non the complexity of the software and the structure of your project. Each\nstage of software development process takes different amounts of time, but the\nmost time-consuming parts are:\n\n  * Requirements gathering: 2-4 months \n  * Design: 6-12 weeks \n  * Development and prototyping: 2-6 months \n  * Testing: 3-6 weeks \n  * Submission to App Store or Google Play: up to 2 weeks \n  * Maintenance and updates: any length of time. Maintenance may span for 20 years, whereas additional development may be 1\u20132 years \n\nFor instance, a well-designed landing page can be developed in 1-2 months. But\nif we\u2019re talking about a full-fledged platform, such as an enterprise social\nnetwork, then the timeline will range from 6 to 7 months.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with game development \u2014 a visual novel game like Romance Club\nwill take up to 2 months. However, a poker game application takes an average\nof 6 months.\n\nBasic mobile app development takes 2-3 months. Moderate \u2014 4-6 months. Complex\n\u2014 6-9 months or even more.\n\n### About us\n\nVironIT is a software development company established in 2004.  \nWe provide comprehensive services including development of mobile\napplications, web-oriented applications, business software solutions, as well\nas software integration and updating, support, and maintenance of software\napplications.\n\n### Business areas\n\n  * Mobile Application Development\n  * Web Application Development\n  * Business Application Development\n  * Game Development\n  * VR/AR Application Development\n  * Blockchain Development\n  * IoT Software Development\n  * App Cost Calculator\n\n### Contacts\n\n  * US:  +1 737 336-5118\n  * GE: +995 598 529 011\n  * info@vironit.com\n  * 7 Akaki Khorava street  \nTbilisi, Georgia\n\n### Follow us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2004 - 2024 VironIT  \nCustom software development company\n\n",
