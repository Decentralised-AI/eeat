business\nchallenges. Whether you're a developer building the next big decentralized\napplication (dApp) or an established enterprise launching a consortium for\nmore efficient transactions, build Web3 solutions with a trusted set of Azure\nproducts and services, Web3 developer tools, and security capabilities.\n\nIssue and verify decentralized identity credentials Build decentralized\ngovernance applications Get tamperproof ledger storage\n\nPrevious Next\n\n##  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n\nQuickly build Web3 capabilities for a variety of identity use cases with\nMicrosoft Entra Verified ID. Based on open standards, Verified ID automates\nverification of identity credentials and enables privacy-protected\ninteractions between organizations and users. Use the Verified ID prebuilt\ntemplates and open-source SDK to build and implement verifiable credentials\nsolutions for onboarding and authenticating users.\n\n##  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n\nWith Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework Preview, a managed\napplication development platform that utilizes the open-source Confidential\nConsortium Framework, build applications that centralize computation while\nproviding decentralized trust. Azure Managed CCF helps you develop stateful\napps with programmable confidentiality and high integrity in a trusted\nexecution environment enabled by Azure confidential computing.\n\n##  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n\nAzure confidential ledger provides a managed and decentralized ledger for data\nsignatures or logs backed by blockchain-like Confidential Consortium\nFramework. Maintain data integrity by preventing unauthorized or accidental\nmodification with tamperproof storage. Protect your data at rest, in transit,\nand in use with hardware-backed secure enclaves used in Azure confidential\ncomputing.\n\nBack to tabs\n\n##  Build with an end-to-end Web3 application platform\n\n###  Develop with a fully managed blockchain service\n\nBuild decentralized networks and deploy applications with less infrastructure\ncomplexity using Quorum Blockchain Service.\n\n###  Support Web3 development with unique developer platforms\n\nCreate Web3 applications with the Microsoft developer tooling ecosystem\nincluding Visual Studio Code and GitHub.\n\n###  Build with a rich partner ecosystem\n\nChoose how to build, manage, and operate your next-generation applications\nwith support from key Web3 partners.\n\n###  Benefit from deep Microsoft Research engagement\n\nExplore new solutions for technologies like zero knowledge proof that will\nform the basis of Web3-based applications.\n\n##  Related products\n\n###  Microsoft Entra Verified ID\n\nAutomate verification of identity credentials and enable privacy-protected\ninteractions between organizations and users.\n\n###  Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework Preview\n\nBuild applications that centralize computation while providing decentralized\ntrust.\n\n###  Azure confidential ledger\n\nTamperproof, unstructured data store hosted in trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) and backed by cryptographically verifiable evidence.\n\n###  Azure Key Vault\n\nSafeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and\nservices.\n\n###  Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nDeploy and scale containers on managed Kubernetes.\n\n##  Explore partner solutions for Web3\n\n###  Kaleido Blockchain Business Cloud\n\nFully managed, full stack platform for building enterprise-grade web3\nsolutions quickly and cost effectively.\n\nRead more\n\n###  Calastone DMI Fund Services\n\nDistributed ledger technology cloud solutions for asset management for a fully\ndigital operating model.\n\n###  Canton blockchain and Daml smart contract language\n\nScalable, privacy-enabled enterprise blockchain technology for financial\nservices and highly regulated industries.\n\nRead more\n\nLearn more about Microsoft's commitment to corporate social responsibility\n\n##  Frequently asked questions\n\n  * ###  How does Microsoft support Web3 applications?\n\nMicrosoft is taking a principled approach to Web3 development. We're at our\nbest when we're a neutral, ethical platform for innovation. As long as\ncustomers find business value in Web3 scenarios, Microsoft will support them\nwith the technology they need within the bounds of our Web3 principles. This\nincludes the Web3 developer tools and cloud platform to build, launch, and\nscale Web3 solutions, as well as first-party solutions such as Microsoft Entra\nVerified ID, Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework, and Azure\nconfidential ledger.\n\n  * ###  What is decentralized identity (ID)?\n\nA decentralized identity approach helps people, organizations, and things\ninteract with each other transparently and securely, in an identity trust\nfabric. People and organizations can control their own digital identity and\ncredentials.\n\n  * ###  When should I use Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework?\n\nUse Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework when you need to develop\nmultiparty applications, with centralized compute, decentralized trust,\nselective sharing of data, hardware-based protection of data in use, and an\nimmutable transaction ledger, but you don't have the resources or expertise to\nset up the supporting infrastructure.\n\n  * ###  When should I use Azure confidential ledger?\n\nAzure confidential ledger is a distributed ledger, meaning the business logic\nisn't centrally controlled. Confidential ledger uses Azure confidential\ncomputing capabilities running exclusively on hardware-backed secure enclaves.\nChoose Azure confidential ledger for tamperproof data storage in scenarios\nwhere critical metadata records must not be modified, including in perpetuity\nfor regulatory compliance and archival purposes.\n\n  * ###  When should I use Kaleido Quorum Blockchain Service?\n\nKaleido Quorum Blockchain Service is a managed blockchain service, providing\nthe infrastructure required to build a blockchain consortium. This service\nutilizes the open-source Quorum protocol for a flexible, decentralized, and\nconfigurable network. Choose Quorum Blockchain Service if you need to\nimplement a full-featured distributed blockchain network.\n\n##  Start your decentralized identity journey\n\nEnable more secure interactions with an enterprise-ready decentralized ID\nservice based on open standards.\n\nGet started\n\n##  Build decentralized governance apps\n\nLearn more about Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework, a\ncentralized compute service with decentralized trust.\n\nRead about the preview\n\n##  Ready when you are\n\nLet's set up your Azure free account.\n\nStart free\n\n## Additional Navigation\n\nGet the Azure mobile app\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nExplore Azure\n\n### Explore Azure\n\n  * What is Azure?\n  * Get started\n  * Global infrastructure\n  * Datacenter regions\n  * Trust your cloud\n  * Customer enablement\n  * Customer stories\n\nProducts and pricing\n\n### Products and pricing\n\n  * Products\n  * Pricing\n  * Free Azure services\n  * Flexible purchase options\n  * Cloud economics\n  * Optimize your costs\n\nSolutions and support\n\n### Solutions and support\n\n  * Solutions\n  * Resources for accelerating growth\n  * Solution architectures\n  * Support\n  * Azure demo and live Q&A\n\nPartners\n\n### Partners\n\n  * Azure Marketplace\n  * Find a partner\n  * Join ISV Success\n\nResources\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Training and certifications\n  * Documentation\n  * Blog\n  * Developer resources\n  * Students\n  * Events and webinars\n  * Analyst reports, white papers, and e-books\n  * Videos\n\nCloud computing\n\n### Cloud computing\n\n  * What is cloud computing?\n  * What is cloud migration?\n  * What is a hybrid cloud?\n  * What is AI?\n  * What is IaaS?\n  * What is SaaS?\n  * What is PaaS?\n  * What is DevOps?\n\nChange language English (US) \u010ce\u0161tina Dansk Deutsch English (Australia) English\n(Canada) English (India) English (UK) Espa\u00f1ol Espa\u00f1ol (MX) Fran\u00e7ais Fran\u00e7ais\n(Canada) Indonesia Italiano Magyar Norsk Nederlands Polski Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)\nPortugu\u00eas Svenska T\u00fcrk\u00e7e P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u4e2d\u6587(\u7b80\u4f53) \u4e2d\u6587(\u7e41\u9ad4)\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Opt-Out Icon Your Privacy Choices\n\n  * Diversity and Inclusion\n  * Accessibility\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Data Protection Notice\n  * Trademarks\n  * Terms of use\n  * Privacy Data Management\n  * Manage cookies\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sitemap\n  * \u00a9 Microsoft 2024\n\nChat with sales\n\nCan we help you?\n\nChat now  No thanks\n\n",
