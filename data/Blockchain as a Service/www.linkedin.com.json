Nuseibeh\n\n###  Rajai M. Nuseibeh\n\n####  Managing Director | Venture Builder | Digital Transformer\n\nPublished Mar 26, 2023\n\n\\+ Follow\n\nThe rise of blockchain technology has opened up new possibilities for\nbusinesses to build decentralized products and dApps. However, building a\nblockchain from scratch can be a daunting and expensive task, requiring a high\nlevel of technical expertise. Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) has emerged as a\nviable solution, offering companies a ready-to-use infrastructure to create\ndigital products using blockchain fundamentals. In this article, we will\nexplore the technical aspects of BaaS, cost, security, scalability, and\napproach using a BaaS solution versus building a blockchain from scratch.\n\n### What is BaaS?\n\nThe need for Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) emerged as a result of the growing\ninterest in blockchain technology and its potential for various applications.\nHowever, building and deploying blockchain applications requires significant\nexpertise in distributed systems, cryptography, and software development,\nwhich can be a significant challenge for many businesses and organizations.\n\nBaaS is a cloud-based service that allows users to create and manage digital\nproducts using blockchain technology. Instead of building a blockchain from\nscratch, businesses can use a pre-built infrastructure that is scalable,\nsecure, and cost-effective. BaaS providers offer a range of tools and\napplications that simplify the process of building decentralized products,\nsuch as smart contracts, transaction management, and user authentication.\n\n### Why BaaS?\n\nBaaS emerged as a way to make it easier for businesses and developers to build\nand deploy blockchain-based applications without having to invest in building\ntheir own blockchain infrastructure. With BaaS, users can leverage pre-built\nblockchain networks and infrastructure provided by cloud service providers,\nwhich allows them to focus on building the application logic and functionality\nrather than worrying about the underlying blockchain infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, BaaS makes it easier for businesses to experiment with blockchain\ntechnology without having to commit significant resources to building and\nmaintaining their own infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for\nsmaller businesses and startups who may not have the resources to build and\nmaintain their own blockchain infrastructure.\n\n### BaaS Use Cases\n\nBaaS can be used in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare,\nand supply chain management.\n\n### BaaS vs. Building your BlockChain from Scratch\n\nWhen deciding whether to use a BaaS solution or build a blockchain from\nscratch, there are several factors to consider. One of the key advantages of\nBaaS is that it allows organizations to focus on their core competencies\nwithout having to worry about the underlying blockchain infrastructure. This\ncan lead to faster time-to-market and lower development costs. Additionally,\nBaaS providers often offer a range of pre-built components and templates that\ncan be used to accelerate the development process.\n\nOne key consideration is cost. Building a blockchain from scratch can be\nexpensive, requiring significant investment in hardware, software, and\npersonnel. BaaS solutions, on the other hand, offer a more cost-effective\noption, with pay-as-you-go pricing models and no upfront costs.\n\nAnother consideration is security. Building a blockchain from scratch can\nprovide greater security and control, but also requires a higher level of\ntechnical expertise to ensure that the system is secure. BaaS providers offer\npre-built security protocols and compliance standards to ensure that the\ninfrastructure is secure.\n\nScalability is another important factor to consider. BaaS providers offer a\nscalable infrastructure that can grow as your business grows, while building a\nblockchain from scratch can be limited in its scalability and require\nsignificant resources to maintain.\n\nGovernance is also an important consideration when using BaaS. Organizations\nneed to ensure that they have the necessary control and oversight over their\nblockchain applications. This includes issues such as data ownership, privacy,\nand compliance.\n\nWhen building a decentralized application, organizations have the option of\nusing an existing blockchain protocol such as Ethereum or building their own\nblockchain infrastructure. Using an existing blockchain protocol such as\nEthereum offers several advantages, including a large and growing developer\ncommunity, a well-established ecosystem of tools and services, and high levels\nof security and scalability.\n\nHowever, using an existing blockchain protocol also has its limitations. For\nexample, organizations may be limited by the functionality provided by the\nprotocol, and they may be subject to the protocol\u2019s governance and consensus\nmechanisms.\n\n### Cost Structure\n\nSome common ways that BaaS providers monetize their services:\n\n  1. Subscription Model: Some BaaS providers charge a monthly or annual subscription fee for access to their blockchain infrastructure and APIs. The subscription fee may vary depending on the level of usage, such as the number of requests made to the blockchain network or the amount of data stored.\n  2. Pay-Per-Use Model: Some BaaS providers charge based on usage, such as the number of API requests or the amount of data transferred. In this model, customers only pay for the resources they use.\n  3. Gas Fees: Some BaaS providers may pass on the Ethereum gas fees to their customers. Gas fees are the fees paid to the Ethereum network for executing smart contracts or transactions. When a user interacts with a dApp deployed on the Ethereum network using a BaaS provider, they may be charged a gas fee to cover the cost of executing the smart contract or transaction.\n  4. Custom Pricing: Some BaaS providers may offer custom pricing based on the specific needs of the customer. For example, if a customer requires a high level of performance or custom integrations, the provider may charge a higher fee.\n\nThe pricing model for a BaaS service can vary, and it is important to review\nthe pricing and usage terms of a BaaS provider to understand the cost of using\ntheir service. Depending on the provider and the specific offering, customers\nmay be charged a monthly subscription fee, a pay-per-use fee, gas fees, or\ncustom pricing based on their needs.\n\n### Some useful BaaS Links\n\n  1.
