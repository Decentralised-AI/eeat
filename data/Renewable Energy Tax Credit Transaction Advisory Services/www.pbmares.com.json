The IRS recently clarified procedures for\nexecuting these transfers, providing guidance through REG-101610-23.\n\nThis legislation establishes the framework for eligible taxpayers to sell\nspecific federal income tax credits resulting from qualified renewable energy\nprojects to unrelated parties. It outlines criteria for credit transfers,\nincluding eligibility, transfer methods, and key parameters governing the\nprocess.\n\nThe primary goal of Section 6418 is to encourage investment in renewable\nenergy by facilitating the exchange of tax credits among eligible parties,\nultimately, promoting growth in renewable energy initiatives and projects.\n\nInitially lacking clear implementation details, the IRS\u2019s guidance offers\nprocedural guidelines, refined eligibility criteria, and specific requirements\nand limitations associated with these transfers.\n\nThis initiative has gained traction, with the first publicly announced large-\nscale energy tax credit transaction in August 2023 valued at $1.5 billion,\nhighlighting the potential impact of this provision.\n\n### Eligible Energy Tax Credits\n\nStarting in 2023, Section 6418 allows for the transfer of various federal\nenergy tax credits related to renewable energy investments. The specific\ncredits eligible for transfer under this section encompass a diverse range of\nenergy initiatives, encouraging investment in sustainable practices and\ntechnologies\u2013note that Section 45L is not a transferable credit. These 11\ncredits eligible for transfer include:\n\n  * Section 30C (alternative fuel vehicle refueling property)\n  * Section 45 (renewable electricity production)\n  * Section 45Q (carbon capture equipment)\n  * Section 45U (zero-emission nuclear power production)\n  * Section 45V (production of clean hydrogen)\n  * Section 45X (advanced manufacturing production)\n  * Section 45Y (clean electricity production)\n  * Section 45Z (clean fuel production)\n  * Section 48 (clean energy property)\n  * Section 48C (qualifying advanced energy project)\n  * Section 48E (clean electricity investment)\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\nTransferring energy tax credits involves crucial factors: eligibility criteria\nfor sellers and buyers, timing of credit sales, and the sale mechanics. Each\ncredit has distinct transfer rules, including varying carryback and\ncarryforward years. The general rules governing this process include:\n\n ** _Who can sell:_**\n\n  * Any non-exempt taxpayer, including individuals, pass-through entities, and other organizations. Not-for-Profit, governmental entities, and other exempt organizations qualify for elective pay (\u201cdirect pay\u201d) rather than transferability under IRC Section 6417. (Read more on rules for tax-exempt entities to monetize tax credits here.)\n\n ** _Who can buy:_**\n\n  * Any entity with federal income tax liabilities that can utilize the credits, not related to the seller. Eligible buyers include partnerships, corporations (including S corporations), individuals, trusts, and similar taxpayers.\n\n ** _Timing for Sale:_**\n\n  * Credits can be sold for taxable years starting after December 31, 2022.\n\n ** _Pre-Filing Registration Requirements:_**\n\n  * This requirement outlines the need for a registration number per facility along with detailed documentation. The rules clarify that multiple parties can receive the credit, using the same number for each party but requiring separate numbers for different facilities involved. This guidance indicates that the IRS may plan to open an electronic registration portal in the near future.\n\n ** _Transfer Election Requirements:_**\n\n  * The rules detail transfer election requirements: who can transfer, how and when the election should occur, and limitations. They allow partial transfers from eligible facilities and to multiple taxpayers, ensuring total transferred credits align with project eligibility.\n  * Transfers are restricted if the taxpayer doesn\u2019t own the eligible property or if the credits result from another taxpayer\u2019s election. For certain projects like IRC Section 45Q and solar credits (IRC Section 48) with lease passthrough structures, credit transfers are not allowed from lessees.\n\n ** _Recapture Rules:_**\n\n  * If an eligible project becomes ineligible after credit transfer, the transferee is responsible for recaptured tax credits. The seller must promptly inform the buyer if the project loses eligibility. Interestingly, IRC Section 6418 doesn\u2019t prevent the taxpayer and transferee from agreeing to indemnify against recapture events.\n\n ** _Passive Activity Rules:_**\n\n  * If a tax credit is associated with a \u201cpassive activity\u201d then, the credit is limited under IRC Section 469 which governs passive activities. Any credit disallowed can be carried forward to subsequent tax years.\n\n ** _Excessive Transfers:_**\n\n  * There is a 20% penalty for an excessive transfer; however, the penalty does not apply if the taxpayer receiving the credit shows that the transfer resulted from reasonable cause to be determined by a thorough review of transaction circumstances.\n\n### Other Factors and Limitations\n\nThe newly issued guidance covers a wide range of new specifications, with\ncompanies just starting to explore the financial opportunities and risks.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s challenging to pinpoint an exact selling price for energy\ncredits; however, market research, understanding the current demand, and\nconsulting with experts can help determine a competitive selling price.\n\nFor specific inquiries regarding the transfer of energy tax credits and their\npotential impact on the marketplace, clients can contact Ryan Paul, Partner on\nthe PBMares Construction and Real Estate team.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR(S):  \n  \n\nRyan B.
