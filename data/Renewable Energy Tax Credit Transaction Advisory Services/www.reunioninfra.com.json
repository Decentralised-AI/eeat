Reunion believes risk and scale will continue to drive pricing in\n2024, though pricing bands will widen\n\nAndy Moon\n\nCo-Founder and CEO\n\nCopy link\n\nURL Copied\n\n2023, the first full year of the Inflation Reduction Act, is officially behind\nus. As year-end approached, transactions closed in lockstep with the release\nof further IRS guidance and other market-enabling milestones.\n\nWith the turn of the calendar, we wanted to share our 2023 pricing\nobservations and 2024 pricing predictions.\n\n\u200d\n\n##### 2023 observations\n\n  * Spot \u00a745 PTCs traded in the $0.94 to $0.95 range\n  * Forward and multi-year \u00a745 PTCs traded slightly lower\n  * \u00a748 ITCs broadly traded in three pricing groups: de-risked ITCs ($0.91-$0.93), more complex ITCs ($0.88-$0.91), and uninsured ITCs (varies)\n\n##### 2024 predictions\n\n  * Increased credit supply could further expand tax credits discounts\n  * Risk/complexity and scale will bifurcate the market and be the primary drivers of price\n  * Timing of cashflows, alongside headline discount, will continue to be a meaningful financial metric. Delayed payment terms will result in smaller headline discounts\n\n\u200d\n\n#### Overview of tax credit transfer pricing\n\nTransferable tax credits are sold at a discount per $1.00 of credit, and the\ndiscount is the primary incentive for a buyer to enter into a tax credit\ntransaction. A corporation, for example, buying credits for $0.90 would pay\n$90M in cash in exchange for $100M in tax credits. The company would realize\n$10M of savings, which is not treated as gross income and, therefore, not\nsubject to taxes.\n\nThe net price the seller receives for the credit is typically the buyer\u2019s\npurchase price less the cost of tax credit insurance and transaction fees\n(e.g., fees paid to a platform or facilitator such as Reunion).\n\n#### Looking back on 2023 pricing\n\nThe market for transferable tax credits remains nascent, as transactions\nstarted in earnest following Treasury guidance on June 14, 2023. We have found\nthat offers (and closed transactions) for 2023 tax-year credits are within\nfairly narrow pricing bands based on risk/complexity.\n\nAcross these pricing bands, projects with more scale have tended to drive\nsmaller discounts.\n\n##### \u00a745 production tax credits (PTCs)\n\n\u00a745 PTCs are the simplest transaction to execute, as the credit is\nstraightforward to validate. Buyers commonly review production reports and\nrelated documents to confirm that electricity was produced from an eligible\nproject type and sold to an unrelated third party. Importantly, \u00a745 PTCs do\nnot carry recapture risk.\n\nCurrent-year PTCs have been trading in the $0.94 to $0.95 range. Buyers who\nhave committed to paying for PTCs that will be generated in future tax years\nhave received larger discounts.\n\n##### \u00a748 investment tax credits (ITCs)\n\n\u00a748 ITCs carry more complexity. The buyer will need to validate the cost basis\nused to calculate the ITC as well as the tax year that the project was placed\nin service:\n\n  * Cost basis: If the cost basis has not been properly calculated, the credit can be subject to disallowance by the IRS \n  * Placed-in-service date: The project must be placed in service in the desired tax year; if a project is placed into service in a later-than-expected tax year, the tax credits can be carried back up to three years but the process is not straightforward\n\n\u00a748 ITCs are subject to recapture rules, which require that (1) the property\nremains a qualified energy facility for five years, and (2) there is no change\nin ownership for five years. If these conditions are not met, the IRS will\nrecapture the unvested portion of the ITC (the ITC vests equally over a five-\nyear period).\n\n\u200d\n\n##### 2023 summary pricing\n\n#### The discount is only one financial metric. Many buyers are also\ninterested in timing of cash flows\n\nWhile the discount is often the first question that we receive about tax\ncredit pricing, it is not the only metric to evaluate the financial return of\na tax credit transfer.\n\nThe timing of cash flows from a tax credit transfer is also important to\nbuyers. Treasury\u2019s June 2023 guidance clearly states that a \u201ctransferee\ntaxpayer [i.e., a tax credit purchaser] may also take into account a specified\ncredit portion that it has purchased, or intends to purchase, when calculating\nits estimated tax payments.\u201d\n\nBelow are several examples of how timing of a tax credit purchase can impact\nreturns (assuming buyers purchase credits for $0.90):\n\nFinally, buyers commonly request to delay payments for a tax credit transfer\nto line up with their quarterly estimated tax payments. This is a key\nnegotiation point, as sellers prefer to get paid as soon as possible after\ncredits are generated.\n\nGoing forward, we expect delayed payment terms to result in a smaller headline\ndiscount for the buyer, since the seller will want to be compensated for their\ncost of capital.\n\nIn September 2023, we wrote a detailed discussion on buyer returns and also\nmade a returns calculator available for download.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### Looking forward to 2024 pricing\n\nAs we consider macro-level tax credit pricing in 2024, two major themes come\nto mind: increased credit supply and market bifurcation. The former is an\nemerging trend, while the latter extends from 2023.\n\n##### Increased tax credit supply\n\nEarly analysts predicted that discounts would shrink as the market matures. We\ndo not believe this is a foregone conclusion.\n\nThere is a significant increase in supply of clean energy tax credits for the\n2024 tax year; Reunion\u2019s digital platform already lists over $3 billion in tax\ncredit opportunities for the 2024 tax year. This increased volume of tax\ncredits looking for buyers will put downward pressure on pricing, at least\nuntil buyer demand grows commensurately.\n\nIn contrast, the supply of 2023 tax year credits was constrained, with a\nrelatively small number of projects for buyers to invest in.\n\n##### Continued market bifurcation\n\nHeading into 2024, we believe that the market will bifurcate: certain credits\nwill demand premium pricing while other credits (e.g., uninsured ITCs without\nan indemnity from a creditworthy guarantor) will need to offer a deep discount\nand/or novel ways to mitigate risk.\n\nCommon project types that will garner premium pricing include:\n\n  * \u00a745 PTCs from solar, wind, or advanced manufacturing with an indemnity from a creditworthy guarantor or tax credit insurance\n  * \u00a748 ITCs from sizable solar or battery projects (larger transaction sizes will demand a premium price), with an indemnity from a creditworthy guarantor or tax credit insurance\n  * \u00a748 ITCs from solar or battery projects sold out of tax equity partnerships with experienced sponsors and tax equity investors\n\n##### 2024 summary market drivers\n\nOverall, our view is that risk/complexity and scale will be the two main\ndrivers of pricing. Projects that present buyers with lower risk and greater\nscale will, ultimately, enjoy higher pricing.\n\n#### How Reunion helps\n\nThe Reunion team is available to meet with buyers looking to purchase 2023 or\n2024 tax-year credits, and is also available to answer questions for those\nlooking to learn more about the rapidly growing tax credit transfer market.\n\nPlease find us on LinkedIn or email us at info@reunioninfra.com.\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nNewsletter\n\nNo spam.

All applications received within the initial 30 days will be treated as received at the same time\n  * There are 21 business days in the 30-day window. The last day coincides with the expiration of the federal government\u2019s current continuing resolution\n  * Allocation amounts can different from applied-for amounts\n\n#### Overview of the low-income community bonus\n\nThe low-income bonus is designed to incentivize investment in communities that\nhave historically been left behind. Specifically, the credit promotes wind,\nsolar, and associated energy storage investments in low-income communities, on\nIndian land, as part of affordable housing developments, or benefitting low-\nincome households.\n\nThe low-income bonus is an allocated credit. For 2023, the bonus is subject to\nan 1,800 MW annual capacity limitation, which is further allocated across four\ncategories:\n\n  1. Located in a low-income community: 700 MW\n  2. Located on Indian land: 200 MW\n  3. Qualified Low-Income Residential Project: 200 MW\n  4. Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project: 700 MW\n\nProjects in the first two categories receive a 10% bonus credit value, while\nprojects in the third and fourth categories receive a 20% bonus credit value.\nAll low-income projects must be less than 5 MWac in size.\n\nFor 2023, the 700 MW in category one will be further subdivided: 560 MW will\nbe reserved for residential rooftop solar and other \u201cbehind-the-meter\u201d (BTM)\nfacilities, and 140 MW will be reserved for \u201cfront-of-the-meter\u201d (FTM)\nfacilities.\n\n#### The bonus is available for \u00a748 and \u00a748E credits\n\nThe low-income bonus is only applicable to \u00a748 and \u00a748E investment tax\ncredits. The latter credit, the technology-neutral ITC, is available to\nprojects placed in service in 2025 or later, so it\u2019s possible that many\ndevelopers will generate \u00a748E ITCs.\n\n#### How to apply\n\nSince the low-income bonus is an allocated bonus, developers must apply for\nand receive an allocation from the IRS. (The DOE administers the application\nprocess, but the IRS ultimately makes allocation decisions.)\n\nThe DOE has published a  checklist for applicants in each category.\n\nIf any category or sub-category is oversubscribed during the initial 30-day\nperiod, the IRS will make awards based on a randomized lottery. Following the\ninitial 30-day period, any leftover capacity will be awarded on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis. Applicants may only submit one application per facility,\nper program year.\n\nThe IRS will make allocations with certain ownership and location priorities\nin mind:\n\n  *  **Ownership:** Priority will be given to (1) projects owned directly or indirectly by Indian tribes; (2) consumer or purchasing cooperatives with controlling members who are workers or from low-income households; (3) tax-exempt charities and religious organizations; and (4) state and local governments, and U.S. territories, Indian tribes, and rural electrical cooperatives\n  *  **Location:** Priority will be given to (1) persistent poverty counties, where 20% of residents have experienced high rates of poverty of the last 30 years; and (2) and census tracts designated as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)\n\nOnce a developer has an allocation, they will have four years to complete the\nproject and place it in service.\n\n#### When to apply\n\n##### All applications received within the first 30 days will be treated as\nreceived at the same time\n\nThe allocation portal opened on Thursday, October 19th at 9:00am ET.\nApplications submitted within 30 days of this date will be treated as\nsubmitted on the same date and at the same time.\n\n##### Submit applications _before_ November 17th, when the federal\ngovernment\u2019s current continuing resolution expires\n\nThe 30th day of the application window falls on Friday, November 17th.\nDevelopers should strive to submit their applications _before_ this day\nbecause the federal government\u2019s current, 45-day continuing resolution expires\nat the end of it.\n\n##### Allocation amounts may differ from application amounts\n\nDevelopers who receive an allocation will receive an award letter from the IRS\nwith their allocation amount. Notably, the IRS makes it clear that a developer\n\u201cmay receive an allocation less than its [applied for] nameplate capacity.\u201d\n\nThe allocation, not the project\u2019s capacity, determines the credit value.\n\n##### Reunion expects the IRS to fully allocate the credit\n\nThe IRS and DOE have stated that they can adjust the category allotments\nwithin the low-income bonus credit to ensure full allocation. Therefore, we\nexpect the low-income bonus to be fully utilized every year \u2013 likely within\nthe 30-day, all-applications-are-equal window.\n\n#### The IRS and DOE have released extensive guidance and detailed resources\nfor applicants\n\n##### Guidance\n\n  * **Initial guidance (February 13, 2023):**Notice 2023-17, Initial Guidance Establishing Program to Allocate Environmental Justice Solar and Wind Capacity Limitation Under \u00a748(e)\n  *  **Proposed regulations (May 31, 2023):** Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Additional Guidance on Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program\n  *  **Final regulations (August 10, 2023):**Final Regulations, Additional Guidance on Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program\n  *  **Revenue procedure (August 10, 2023):**Revenue Procedure 2023-27\n\n##### Resources\n\n  * The Department of Energy (DOE) maintains a low-income communities bonus credit program website\n  * Applicant checklist\n  * Category 1 eligibility map with CEJST and persistent poverty county screens\n  * Category 3 eligible covered housing programs\n  * Category 4 household income limits\n\nRead more\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nOctober 14, 2023\n\n6 read\n\nCan a Non-Profit Sell Tax Credits?\n\nAs the leading marketplace for clean energy tax credits, Reunion has been\napproached by many non-profit organizations to help them monetize clean energy\ncredits, primarily from distributed solar projects. Unfortunately, non-profits\nare not able to transfer tax credits to third parties.\n\nBut non-profits have an alternative. The elective pay provision, sometimes\ncalled direct pay, allows \u201capplicable entities,\u201d including tax-exempt\nentities, to benefit from IRA clean energy tax credits even though they are\nnot traditional taxpayers. This provision allows non-profits to receive refund\npayments directly from the IRS for the amount of eligible credits claimed.\n\nUnlike transferable tax credits, where credits are purchased at a discount to\ntheir face value, applicable entities are entitled to receive the full amount\nof the credits from the IRS.\n\nIn order to qualify for elective pay, an applicable entity needs to pre-\nregister its project with the IRS and receive a registration number. The\ndirect payment election is made on Form 990-T, and the amount of credit would\nbe treated as a payment of tax, which would be refundable, absent any other\ntax liability.\n\nThe elective payment provisions of the IRA are codified in IRC \u00a76417. The\ninternal revenue code (IRC) defines six applicable entities that are eligible\nfor elective pay:\n\n  * Organizations exempt from income tax\n  * Any state or political subdivision thereof\n  * The Tennessee Valley Authority\n  * An Indian tribal government\n  * Rural energy cooperatives\n  * Alaska Native Corporations \n\nMost nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) and 501(d) entities, fall into the first\ncategory.\n\n12 credits are available for elective pay:\n\n  * \u00a748: Energy Credit\n  * \u00a748E: Clean Electricity Investment Credit\n  * \u00a745: Renewable Electricity Production Credit\n  * \u00a745Y: Clean Electricity Production Credit\n  * \u00a745W: Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit \n  * \u00a745U: Zero-emission Nuclear Power Production Credit \n  * \u00a745X: Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit\n  * \u00a745V: Clean Hydrogen Production Credit \n  * \u00a745Z: Clean Fuel Production Credit\n  * \u00a745Q: Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit\n  * \u00a730C: Credit for Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling/Recharging Property \n  * \u00a748C: Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit\n\nRead more\n\n### Reunion accelerates investment into clean energy\n\nOur platform facilitates the purchase and sale of transferable tax credits to\nsupport solar, wind, battery, biogas and other clean energy projects.\n\nGet Started\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\n### Sign up for our newsletter\n\nFirst name*\n\nLast name*\n\nEmail*\n\nBy submitting this form I accept the Reunion Privacy Policy.\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy submitting this form I accept the Reunion Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService.\n\nThank you!
