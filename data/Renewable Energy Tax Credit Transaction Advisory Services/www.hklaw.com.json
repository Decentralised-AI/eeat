Our team is\ndistinctly positioned to advise clients in all aspects of energy tax credit\ntransactions and controversies, including those involving renewable power,\nenergy storage, carbon capture, hydrogen, manufacturing, and alternative and\nclean fuels.\n\nOur lawyers represent equity investors as well as developers of renewable\nenergy facilities in all aspects of tax credit transactions, including\nstructuring the transactions, organizing investment and operating entities,\nsecuring debt and tax equity financing, and negotiating contracts with various\npower purchasers, equipment installers and utility companies. We also\nrepresent off-takers, utilities and manufacturers that may be parties to\nrenewable energy transactions but do not directly or immediately benefit from\nthe energy tax credits.\n\nIn addition, the Energy Tax Team regularly represents clients in advocacy,\nassisting with congressional outreach for statutory changes, as well as the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS for regulatory and sub-regulatory\nguidance. When faced with IRS disputes, our energy tax attorneys represent\nclients at all stages of controversy, including examination, mediation, IRS\nappeals, and litigation at the trial and appellate levels.\n\n## A Wide Range of Energy Technologies\n\nHolland & Knight's Energy Tax Team has substantial experience in advising\nclients regarding the full range of energy technologies.\n\n**Renewable Power.** In the renewable power space, our Energy Tax Team assists\ntaxpayers with qualifying for the Section 45 production tax credit (PTC),\nSection 48 investment tax credit (ITC), Section 45J nuclear PTC, and Section\n45U zero-emission nuclear PTC. Our lawyers have vast experience with long-\nstanding tax credits for qualifying renewable energy facilities such as\nonshore and offshore wind, solar, hydro, biomass, landfill gas, nuclear and\ngeothermal power plants, as well as more recently incentivized energy\ntechnologies such as energy storage and qualified biogas property.\n\n**Alternative and Clean Fuels.** We advise clients regarding the established\nbiodiesel, renewable diesel, alternative fuels and second-generation biofuels\ntax credits under Sections 6426, 6427, 34, 40 and 40A, as well as the Section\n40B sustainable aviation fuel credit (SAF), credits for renewable natural gas\n(RNG) and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit enacted by the IRA.\n\n**Carbon Capture.** Holland & Knight's Energy Tax Team is well positioned to\nadvise clients in the carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS)\nsector, having successfully advocated for legislative changes to Section 45Q\nand advised clients in their implementation of carbon capture technologies. We\nadvise clients regarding Section 45Q eligibility, minimum capture thresholds,\nand sequestration and utilization contracts, including leases and CO2 pipeline\ncontracts.\n\n**Clean and Electric Vehicles.** Our attorneys assist with tax credits for\nclean vehicles and clean vehicle infrastructure, including the Section 30D\nclean vehicle tax credit, Section 45W qualified commercial clean vehicle tax\ncredit, Section 25E previously owned cleaned vehicle credit and Section 30C\nalternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit. In addition, our Energy\nTax Team assists clean vehicle clients in advocacy and tax credit transaction\nstructuring, including monetization. We also advise manufacturers, lessor,\npurchasers and other clients in meeting the eligibility requirements for these\ncredits, including those in the supply chain providing critical mineral and\nbattery components.\n\n**Other Tax Incentives Under the IRA.** Our energy tax lawyers also advise\nclients with respect to newer energy tax incentives provided in the IRA,\nincluding the Section 45V clean hydrogen PTC and Section 45X advanced\nmanufacturing production credit, as well as the revived Section 48C qualifying\nadvanced energy project credit.\n\n## Breadth of Experience\n\nIn addition, Holland & Knight's Energy Tax Team works with clients on a broad\nspectrum of tax matters related to energy tax credits.\n\n**Legislative and Regulatory.** Our attorneys regularly represent clients in\nseeking legislative changes, including changes that were included in the IRA,\nas well as regulatory and sub-regulatory guidance, including private letter\nrulings. We also work with Holland & Knight's Legislative Tax Team to help\nclients in advocating on Capitol Hill and with the Treasury Department and IRS\nfor needed clarity to help achieve our client's goals.\n\n**Transactional.** Our team also provides transactional advice, representing\nclients in drafting and negotiating any agreement needed for project\ndevelopment and acquisitions and dispositions of projects, including equipment\nsupply agreements, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) agreements,\nbuild-transfer agreements (BTA), operations and maintenance (O&M) agreements,\nlimited liability company agreements (LLCA), purchase and sale agreements, and\nother transactions.\n\n**Tax Controversy and Litigation.** Our lawyers have represented clients in\nmajor energy tax credit controversies at IRS examination and appeals, in the\nU.S. Tax Court, District Courts and Court of Federal Claims, as well as in\nfederal appellate courts. We have been actively involved in the most\nsignificant energy tax credit controversies over the last two decades,\nincluding Section 29 \"spray and pray\" matters, Section 6426 and 6427 fuel tax\ncontroversies such as taxability, \"splash and dash\" and black liquor, and\nSection 1603 grant litigation.\n\n**Monetization.** We have represented clients for many years in tax equity\ntransactions \u2013 including the partnership flip, sale-leaseback and inverted\nlease structures \u2013 to monetize tax credits. With the new monetization\nopportunities in the IRA, our attorneys now also assist clients in regard to\nconsiderations for structuring tax credit transactions for optimal\nmonetization, specifically through the use of direct pay or transfer of\ncredits.\n\n**Advisory**. We work with clients to provide business-relevant tax advice\ninvolving tax credits. This includes helping clients in understanding energy\ntax credits and the impact on their businesses, as well as the importance of\nstructuring business operations to obtain and maximize credit value.\n\n## Thorough Tax Understanding\n\nOur Energy Tax Team has a wealth of experience and knowledge regarding energy\ntax issues, but we also believe that having a more thorough understanding of\nthe tax laws in general is essential in properly advising clients. We serve as\nbusiness and tax advisors in all aspects of the energy sector, and while tax\ncredits are an important part of our counsel, they are not the sole focus of\nour broader energy tax practice. To that end, our attorneys bring to clients\nmany decades of experience that span the Tax Code and fully draw upon our work\nin advising clients in all nature of tax issues, including those that impact\nbusinesses in any industry.\n\n## Deep Industry Knowledge\n\nThe members of our Energy Tax Team know the energy industry. Our lawyers\nbelieve that to properly advise clients, we must have a thorough understanding\nof the energy industry and trends. For example, we regularly counsel public\nutilities regarding a full range of issues affecting the utility sector,\nincluding normalization of depreciation, the investment tax credit and related\nratemaking issues, abandonments, decommissioning, elections out of Subchapter\nK, structuring transactions such as investments in renewables, public utility\nproperty issues and advising on tax controversies. Our Energy Tax Team\ntestifies before public utility commissions, including the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC), on the treatment of taxes in ratemaking and also\nassists utility personnel with testimony before the Treasury Department and\nIRS on proposed regulations affecting the utility industry. Our attorneys also\nadvise clients on fuel excise taxes, Form 637 registrations and the Superfund\nTax.\n\n## Broad Legal Guidance for Your Needs\n\nWe routinely leverage the extensive resources and capabilities of the broader\nHolland & Knight team of more than 2,200 attorneys \u2013 including colleagues who\nfocus on the oil and gas sector and other key areas of the energy industry,\nour Public Policy & Regulation Group and team members who assist clients in\nseeking non-tax governmental funding, including with assistance in preparing\ngrant applications before the U.S. Department of Energy \u2013 to provide a full\nrange of services to clients interested in the energy transition.\n\n## Multimedia\n\nRenewable Energy Tax Credits with Amish Shah\n\nProposed Rules to Implement the Superfund Tax on Chemicals\n\nEyes on Energy Tax: Understanding the Qualified Advanced Energy Tax Credit\nUnder Section 48C\n\nAdjusting for Climate Change: Clean Energy Tax Proposals\n\n## Insights\n\nProject Labor Agreement Requirement for Large-Scale Construction Becomes\nEffective Jan. 22\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\n7 Minutes\n\nTreasury, IRS Release Section 45V Clean Hydrogen PTC Proposed Regulations\n\nDecember 22, 2023\n\n3 Minutes\n\nIRS, Treasury Department Release New Section 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel\nCredit Guidance\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\n3 Minutes\n\nBreaking Down the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen PTC Proposed Regulations\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\n16 Minutes\n\nAn In-Depth Look at Section 45X Proposed Regulations\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\n8 Minutes\n\nTreasury, IRS Release Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit\nProposed Regulations\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n2 Minutes\n\n### Project Labor Agreement Requirement for Large-Scale Construction Becomes\nEffective Jan. 22\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  January 12, 2024 /  7 Minutes\n\n### Breaking Down the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen PTC Proposed Regulations\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  January 10, 2024 /  16 Minutes\n\n### Treasury, IRS Release Section 45V Clean Hydrogen PTC Proposed Regulations\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  December 22, 2023 /  3 Minutes\n\n### An In-Depth Look at Section 45X Proposed Regulations\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  December 18, 2023 /  8 Minutes\n\n### IRS, Treasury Department Release New Section 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel\nCredit Guidance\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  December 15, 2023 /  3 Minutes\n\n### Treasury, IRS Release Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit\nProposed Regulations\n\n_Holland & Knight Alert_ /  December 14, 2023 /  2 Minutes\n\nView More\n\n## Upcoming Events\n\n### Fireside Chat: Pushing the Envelope: New Frontiers in Project Finance\n\nInfocast's Solar + Wind Finance & Investment Summit /  March 12, 2024\n\n### Bio and Renewable Fuels, Hydrogen and Carbon Capture\n\nInaugural Renewable Energy Tax Conference, State Bar of Texas Tax Section /\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\n### 2024 Midyear Tax Meeting\n\nAmerican Bar Association /  January 18 - 20, 2024\n\n## News and Headlines\n\n### In Biden\u2019s Climate Law, a Boon for Green Energy, and Wall Street\n\n_The New York Times_ /  In the Headlines /  November 23, 2023\n\n### Tax Partner Liz Young Joins Holland & Knight's Tax Credit Syndication\nGroup\n\nPress Release /  September 18, 2023\n\n### IRA at 1: U.S. Heralds Clean Energy Manufacturing 'Renaissance'\n\n_S &P Global_ /  In the Headlines /  August 7, 2023\n\nView More\n\nPrimary Contacts\n\nAmish Shah Nicole M.
