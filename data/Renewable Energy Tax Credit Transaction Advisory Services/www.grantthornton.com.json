With the help of these credits, what began as experimental\nspending on emerging technologies has grown into an interconnected ecosystem\nthat spills across sectors, the panelists said. More than just the deployment\nof solar panels, there\u2019s widespread interest in energy storage, transmission\nand efficiency \u2014 with financial opportunities for almost any business.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter where you are in your decarbonization journey, one thing\u2019s for\nsure,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cCompanies are always looking for a way to move up the\nladder \u2014 to lower costs, improved reliability and resilience, accelerated\nthrough the use of digital solutions and distributed energy resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nDigging further into the opportunities that are being created, a lot more in\nthe renewables industry should be considered in addition to energy generation.\nSectors that enable renewable energy\u2019s widespread adoption, improve\nefficiency, and develop innovative technologies for a sustainable future\ninclude:\n\n\n\n**Sustainable construction:** Wind turbines and other clean energy\ninfrastructure items need to be built.\n\n\n\n**Energy storage:** Batteries, capacitors and other energy storage products\nneed to be built and distributed.\n\n\n\n**Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing:** The transition to electric\ntransportation relies on the development and manufacturing of EVs, including\ncars, buses, trucks and bicycles.\n\n** **\n\n**Smart grid and energy management:** Renewable energy integration requires\nefficient grid management and energy distribution systems. The development and\nimplementation of smart grid technologies, energy management software and\ndemand response systems enables renewable energy generation and consumption.\n\n\n\n**Solar panel manufacturing:** The production of solar panels, including\nphotovoltaic cells, modules and associated components, is a huge driver of\nrenewable energy projects, and the declining cost of solar panels makes solar\nenergy a more affordable and attractive option for residential, commercial and\nutility-scale applications.\n\n** **\n\n**Hydrogen production and fuel cells:** Companies involved in hydrogen\nproduction through electrolysis or other methods, as well as fuel cell\nmanufacturing, are seeing growth.\n\n** **\n\n**Environmental consulting and services:** These services addressing\nenvironmental impact, regulatory compliance, and wildlife protection are\ncrucial in ensuring that renewable energy projects are implemented\nresponsibly.\n\n\n\nTogether, these sectors comprise an efficient, interconnected and profitable\nrenewable ecosystem, with major commercial gains expected not only for the\nfirst and fastest movers, but also for well-established companies and\norganizations focused on maintaining relevance into the future.\n\nShare with your network\n\nShare\n\n8\n\n0\n\n10\n\n96\n\nRequest a meeting\n\nSubmit RFP\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related resources\n\n **guide**\n\nPower up on energy industry tax strategy \u2014>\n\n **article**\n\nEnergy trends: Technology, regulation and a renewable boost \u2014>\n\n#### Related resources\n\n **guide**\n\nPower up on energy industry tax strategy \u2014>\n\n **article**\n\nEnergy trends: Technology, regulation and a renewable boost \u2014>\n\n#### Related resources\n\n **guide**\n\nPower up on energy industry tax strategy \u2014>\n\n **article**\n\nEnergy trends: Technology, regulation and a renewable boost \u2014>\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our Energy thought leadership\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **M &A opportunities abound**\n\n\n\nThe growth of renewable energy coupled with government support through tax\ncredits has created incentives for substantial investment \u2014 and numerous M&A\nopportunities. Major legacy players are making multibillion dollar\ninvestments, including BP, ExxonMobil, and major utilities NextEra Energy and\nIberdola. Meanwhile, dedicated private capital providers such as New Energy\nCapital, Quantum Energy Partners and Angeleno Group are devoting extensive\nresources to this sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a number of corporate and private equity buyers become more active\nin solar, energy storage and onshore wind, as well as the adjacent companies,\u201d\nsaid Grant Thornton Managing Director for Transaction Advisory Services Tim\nDouek.\n\n\n\nThe heavy interest in renewable energy also is driving mergers and\nacquisitions. The most active subsectors for deals from an M&A standpoint have\nbeen energy infrastructure (which includes site development and large-scale\nsolar and wind projects) and electrical equipment (which includes storage,\ntransmission and energy management), Douek said.\n\n\n\n\u201cA number of the deals we\u2019ve seen are starting to reference the Inflation\nReduction Act in their deal materials\u2026Clearly the IRA is factoring into\nportfolio strategies for many firms,\u201d Douek said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **How to use IRA renewable incentives**\n\n_ _\n\nThe IRA is designed in several ways to make investment in renewables more\nattractive and feasible. The IRA enhances and extends existing tax credits and\ncreates new ones while also encouraging M&A by making credits easier to use\nand monetize. To receive full credit amounts under the IRA, employers will\ngenerally need to meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Three\nof the credits in the package are refundable \u2014 meaning they can be paid out in\ncash even if an entity doesn\u2019t have a tax obligation \u2014 and the rest are\ngenerally transferable, allowing them to be sold for cash to third parties, an\nincentive that could prompt M&A activity. Tax-exempts can generally claim all\nthe credits as refundable direct payments.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe IRA is expected to significantly expand the pipeline of investment\nflowing into renewables and energy, and it promises to provide a more\npractical approach to monetizing the credits,\u201d said Grant Thornton Managing\nDirector for Corporate Tax Services Tracey Baird.\n\n\n\nLarger companies will be hungry for the credits, while smaller businesses will\nbe better able to use them because they have the option to take them in cash\nor sell them. This shift to transferrable credits could allow organizations to\nuse simpler corporate and tax structures while pursuing projects. Baird\npredicted that fewer companies will turn to tax equity partnerships, which\nhave been popular in recent years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to mean less need for expensive and complex tax structures,\u201d\nBaird said of the new IRA approach.\n\n\n\nThe Grant Thornton panelists highlighted the IRA\u2019s effects on the following\ncredits:\n\n  * **Sec. 45 Production Tax Credit and Sec. 48 Investment Tax Credit for renewable energy and utilities:** These two credits offer alternative options: a credit based on the cost of the property or a credit based on the amount electricity generated for 10 years. Solar, wind and biogas property seem to be **** major targets right now for investments, although the credits apply to other property **** as well. Projects that began construction before January 2023 can avoid the wage and apprenticeship rules, but there are specific rules for determining when construction began. For projects that may qualify for both credits, companies will have to choose the one that provides the most benefit based on their desired return.\n  *  **Sec. 45Q Tax Credit for carbon oxide sequestration:** This provision offers a credit per ton of carbon oxide captured and sequestered, and can offer significant benefits to power plants, refineries, chemical plants and carbon-intensive manufacturers. The amount of credit will be determined by how the company captures the carbon, the amount of carbon that is captured and sequestered, and what is done to sequester the carbon once it\u2019s captured. The highest credit rates are available for direct air capture, but Baird said that technology isn\u2019t yet cost-effective, even with the higher credit rates.  \n\n  * **Sec. 48C Investment Tax Credit for advanced energy projects:** This credit is available for investing in the capacity to manufacture many components in the energy supply chain, but can only be secured through an application process.\n\nCompanies are interested in projects ranging from just a few hundred thousand\ndollars \u2014 such as to electrify the boilers of a building \u2014 into the hundreds\nof millions to build wind or solar plants. Documenting how your organization\nmeets the requirements for the credits, including wage and apprenticeship\nrequirements, is going to be vital, especially with regard to transferring the\ncredits on the open market, Baird said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Seeking clarity on the IRA**\n\n\n\nDespite growing momentum and renewed excitement, crucial details of the\nfederal investment package remain unclear. First, there\u2019s the question of the\ncredits\u2019 value when transferred. The Grant Thornton panelists predicted that\nsmaller, higher-risk projects might fetch tax credits that sell for 80 to 90\ncents per dollar of tax credit, while larger, more conservative projects could\nget stronger prices.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, companies must navigate the application and approval processes\nfor the new and expanded credits \u2014 which requires both an understanding of the\ngovernment\u2019s overarching priorities and a strong base of data and technical\nexpertise in the relevant topics. For example, the Section 48C credit has\nresumed in 2023 after being frozen for lack of funding since 2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cSection 48C is a very popular credit right now, and clients ask us lots of\nquestions about it,\u201d said Grant Thornton Managing Principal of Credits &\nIncentives Services Mike Eickhoff.\n\n\n\nThe IRS has allocated $10 billion to fund the Section 48C credit in two rounds\nin 2023. Concept papers were due July 31 for the current round \u2014 requiring\ncompanies to distill their vision into just four summary pages for the initial\napplication.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of information to pack into four pages, which can be very\ndifficult for many organizations, as some of these projects are quite\ncomplex,\u201d Eickhoff said.\n\n\n\nAnd at least for the Section 48C program, eligibility alone does not guarantee\ncredits will be granted. Eickhoff urged applicants to understand and emphasize\nhow their projects connect to the larger priorities of the federal government.\nA second round of allocations will open in 2024.\n\n\n\n\u201cTheoretically, you could be eligible for this program under statute \u2026 but if\nyour project doesn\u2019t align itself to the current administration\u2019s agenda, it\nmay impact your ability to be approved,\u201d Eickhoff said.\n\n\n\nInvestors should look beyond the federal tax credits and examine the full\nslate of state and local tax incentives for renewable projects.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome folks will think of things in isolation,\u201d Eickhoff said. But the state\nand local options range from free land in Missouri to reduced utility costs in\nAlabama and major property tax abatements in Texas \u2014 making them potentially\nvaluable additions to the renewable financing equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Be aware of new tax credit complexities**\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and taking action around the new tax credits is sure to come\nwith new logistical and financial challenges for companies, even as the\nopportunities are substantial. The various credits can interact in complex\nways \u2014 and in some cases, the U.S. government hasn\u2019t yet clarified those\ninteractions. One example: Some companies applied for the Section 48C credit\nbecause of the time-limited application window, but may instead pivot to the\nSection 45X advanced manufacturing production credit for domestic\nmanufacturers of energy components if it proves more favorable, Baird said.\n\n\n\nFor now, companies should model multiple options and enlist experts to ensure\na full view of their options.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions impacting the financing of projects, whether\ntransferability is going to help and what structuring may be needed to be done\nto ensure the greatest return on investment, which is why modeling these\ndifferent financial arrangements and impacts is going to be really important,\u201d\nBaird said.\n\n\n\nThe credits also come with strict requirements for the labor employed on\nqualifying projects. Companies will have to verify that workers are paid\nprevailing wages and that the projects offer a certain amount of work through\napprenticeship programs. It\u2019s the first time that the IRS has been responsible\nfor enforcing such requirements, which creates uncertainty about how entities\nwill document compliance by their general contractors and subcontractors.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a bit of an unknown right now, and that\u2019s where a lot of the tax\nplanning and getting some outside tax help can really be helpful,\u201d Baird said.\n\n\n\nThe labor requirements apply to projects with a construction start date on or\nafter Jan. 29, 2023, although a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision is available for those\nthat incurred at least 5% of their total cost by that date. The labor\nrequirements also may apply to repairs for up to a decade after the completion\nof construction. Failure to meet those labor requirements could slash the\nvalue of credits by up to 80%. Eickhoff gave an example of a Grant Thornton\nclient applying for a $60 million credit \u2014 putting up to $48 million at risk\nif the project falls short of labor requirements.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, domestic sourcing requirements on some credits could prove onerous,\nrequiring companies to know, understand and document supply chain of\ncomponents under a complex set of rules, Baird said. But even with some\nquestions unresolved, the panelists and many in the audience were bullish\nabout the renewable market under the new federal incentive regime.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe IRS is actually encouraging people to take\u201d the credits, Baird said.\n\u201cWhile other countries have taken more of a stick approach \u2026 punishing\noffenders with taxes and charges \u2026 the U.S. is attempting to encourage good\nbehavior.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s making the return on investment extremely attractive.\u201d\n\n\n\n#### Related resources\n\n\n\n**WEBCAST REPLAY**\n\nEnergy transition: Renewable energy, M&A activity and the impact of the\nInflation Reduction Act >>  \n\n\n\n**WEBCAST SERIES**\n\nEnergy Symposium 2023 webcast series >>  \n\n\n\n\n\n#### Contacts:\n\n\n\n#####  Adam Bowen\n\nManaging Director, Growth Advisory  \n\n+1 312 602 8443\n\n\n\n#####  Tim Douek\n\nManaging Director, Transaction Advisory  \n\nTimothy Douek is a Managing Director within Grant Thornton\u2019s Transaction\nAdvisory practice.
