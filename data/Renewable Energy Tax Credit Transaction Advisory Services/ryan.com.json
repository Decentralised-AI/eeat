To remain at the forefront, companies must maneuver through a\nrapidly evolving regulatory landscape and aggressively pursue all available\nincentives. Whether you\u2019re a renewable energy developer or corporate taxpayer\nlooking to participate in the energy transition, Ryan\u2019s Renewable Energy\nAdvisory team is the industry\u2019s one-stop shop for navigating the tax,\naccounting, and financial challenges that accompany renewable energy\ninvestments.\n\n### Transferable Credit Opportunities for Renewable Energy Developers\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 directed $386 billion to clean-\nenergy spending and tax incentives, making it the federal government\u2019s\nlargest-ever investment in renewable energy. The IRA increased and extended\nthe tax credits available to renewable energy projects, while also providing\ncredits for additional technologies and project types.\n\nRead More\n\n### Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit  \nIRC Section 48C Tax Credit Advisory\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 reinstated and extended the Section\n48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit to catalyze investment in\nmanufacturing facilities for clean energy technologies. Section 48C is a\ncompetitive credit, meaning manufacturers must apply to the Internal Revenue\nService to receive an allocation.\n\nRead More\n\nBack to Income Tax\n\n#### Renewable Energy Tax Advisory\n\npdf Download\n\n#### Renewable Energy Tax Credit Process Map\n\nPDF Download\n\n##  Services\n\n  * Recovery\n  * Consulting\n  * Advocacy\n  * Compliance\n  * Technology\n  * Practice Areas\n  * Strategic Alliances\n\n##  Industries\n\n  * Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n  * Business Services\n  * Construction\n  * Financial Services\n  * Food Services\n  * Government Contractors\n  * Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Oil and Gas\n  * Real Estate\n  * Retail\n  * Technology\n  * Telecommunications\n  * Transportation\n  * Utilities\n\n##  ABOUT RYAN\n\n  * Why Ryan\n  * End-to-End Tax Services\n  * Unmatched Results\n  * Leadership\n  * Awards\n  * Our Purpose and Values\n  * Our Pledges\n  * Corporate Citizenship\n  * Our History\n  * Global\n  * Locations\n\n##  News & Insights\n\n  * Press Room\n  * Events & Webinars\n  * Media Kit\n\n### Ryan Thought Leadership\n\nStay informed of important tax issues that impact your business.\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * Global\n  * Careers\n  * Locations\n  * Contact\n  * Legal\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies Settings\n  * Accessibility Settings\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n\u00a9 2024 Ryan, LLC\n\nPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of website accessibility\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your\ndevice to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our\nmarketing efforts.\n\nAccept All Cookies Reject All\n\nCookies Settings\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your\nbrowser, mostly in the form of cookies.
