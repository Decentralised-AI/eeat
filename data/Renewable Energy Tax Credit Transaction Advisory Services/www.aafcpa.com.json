But this is a\nmisnomer, as there are many situations where a nonprofit may have to either\npay or collect and remit tax. Private foundations, also under the umbrella of\n501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, are subject to a 1.39 percent net\ninvestment tax on their investment income [\u2026]\n\nGuidance: CECL Standard for CDFIs\n\n### Guidance: CECL Standard for CDFIs\n\nThe long-awaited Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Standard, Accounting\nStandards Update 2016-13 \u2013 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)\nwill be effective for nonpublic business entities and not-for-profit entities\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. This means CECL will be\neffective for the calendar year 2023 reporting period and fiscal year 2024 for\noff-year [\u2026]\n\nAffordable Housing Sponsors Approaching LIHTC Property Transitions\n\n### Affordable Housing Sponsors Approaching LIHTC Property Transitions\n\nThe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, enacted in 1987, has been\nparamount for financing the construction and rehabilitation of properties in\nlow-income communities.
