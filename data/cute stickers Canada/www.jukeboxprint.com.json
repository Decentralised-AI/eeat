This allows for the stickers to be easily\npeeled off and applied to surfaces. Kiss cut stickers are often made using a\nspecial type of cutting machine that is programmed to cut the vinyl layer to a\nspecific depth without cutting through the backing material.\n\nThe process of making kiss cut stickers involves first printing the desired\ndesign onto a large sheet of vinyl. Then, a cutting machine equipped with a\nspecial blade is used to cut the vinyl into the desired shape. The blade is\nset to a specific depth, allowing it to cut the vinyl layer without cutting\nthrough the backing material.\n\nKiss cut stickers are popular for a variety of uses, including branding,\nmarketing, and personal expression. They can be made in a wide range of sizes,\nshapes, and colors, making them highly customizable. Because they are easy to\npeel off and apply, kiss cut stickers are ideal for use on products,\npackaging, and promotional materials. They are also commonly used for home\ndecor, car stickers, laptop stickers, and phone cases.\n\nOverall, kiss cut stickers are a versatile and practical type of sticker that\noffers a lot of creative potential. With their unique cutting process and\nendless customization options, kiss cut stickers are a great way to add some\npersonality and flair to any project or product.  \n  \n\n **Die Cut Stickers**\n\nDie cut stickers are a type of sticker that is precisely cut into a custom\nshape, rather than being a simple rectangular or square shape. This is\nachieved by using a die, which is a specialized tool that is created to cut\nthe sticker into the desired shape with extreme precision.\n\nThe process of making die cut stickers involves first printing the desired\ndesign onto a large sheet of vinyl. Then, a die is placed over the printed\nsheet, and a special machine is used to apply pressure and cut the sticker\ninto the custom shape. The die can be created in almost any shape or size,\nallowing for a wide range of customization options.\n\nDie cut stickers are popular for a variety of uses, including branding,\nmarketing, and personal expression. They are often used for product labels,\nwindow stickers, and promotional materials. They are also commonly used for\nhome decor, laptop stickers, and phone cases.\n\nDie cut stickers offer a unique advantage over other types of stickers, as\nthey can be cut into any shape imaginable, making them highly customizable and\nperfect for creating unique and eye-catching designs. They are also highly\ndurable and resistant to wear and tear, making them a great option for outdoor\nuse.\n\nOverall, die cut stickers are a versatile and practical type of sticker that\noffers a lot of creative potential. With their precise cutting process and\nendless customization options, die cut stickers are a great way to add some\npersonality and flair to any project or product.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing between kiss cut and die cut stickers is like choosing between two\nworks of art. The kiss cut is like a masterpiece that is framed and\nhighlighted by its border, drawing attention to its beauty and intricacy.\nMeanwhile, the die cut is like a sculpture, where every detail is carefully\ncarved and defined to create a unique and captivating design.\n\nBoth kiss cut and die cut stickers offer endless possibilities for creativity\nand customization. Whether you want a sleek and simple design or a bold and\nintricate masterpiece, there is a sticker cutting method that can bring your\nvision to life.\n\nSo, the next time you're looking to add some flair to your laptop, water\nbottle, or any other surface, consider whether a kiss cut or die cut sticker\nwould be the perfect fit. Either way, you can rest assured that your sticker\nwill be a work of art that is sure to turn heads and leave a lasting\nimpression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Is the Eco Adhesive Sticker recyclable?\n\nNo, our Eco Adhesive Sticker is not recyclable. However, it is made of non-\ntoxic materials and is FSC certified.\n\n##### Can I order samples of your stickers?\n\nYes!

This means\nno limits to your creativity, each sticker can vary in size and shape! These\nare also ideal for smaller stickers such as 1\" - 2\" because cut of the\nstickers allows for a super easy-to-peel experience.\n\n#### File Setup\n\nThe smallest sticker sheet we can print is 4\" x 6\" and largest is 50\" x 50\".\nHowever, below are the most popular sizes:\n\n  * 4\" x 6\"\n  * 5\" x 7\"\n  * 5.5\" x 8.5\"\n  * 8.5\" x 11\"\n\nIf your stickers are custom shaped, you will need to provide the cut line(s)\nfor each shape. We will normally provide the first custom cut line for free,\nbut if your sticker sheet will have multiple custom shaped stickers, we will\nrequire you to provide the cut lines (at least for the additional designs\nafter the first one).\n\nNote that we will do the imposition of the stickers on the sheet, so we will\nonly need you to provide your artwork and cut line file(s).\n\nFor guidance, please explore the articles and tools below:\n\n  * Design Considerations for Sticker Sheets\n  * How to Create a Die Cut Sticker with a Kiss Cut in Illustrator in 7 Quick Steps\n  * Custom Sticker Maker \n\nIf your stickers are rectangle, square, circle or oval, we can set up the cut\nline for you at no cost.

This\nmethod makes for easier removal as the sticker is peeled away from the\nadhesive border and the paper backing remains.\n\nBackings are available in our standard shapes: circle, oval, rectangle and\nsquare, but you also have the option to upgrade to a custom shape to match\nyour inner sticker shape.\n\nSee: Can I order multiple stickers on a sheet?\n\n##### What is the smallest sticker you can produce?\n\nThe smallest individual easy peel sticker we can produce is 0.5\".\n\nIf you require stickers smaller than 0.5\", we can produce stickers as small as\n5mm via a custom order.
