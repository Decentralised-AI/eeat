Accely provides SAP migration services for all\nenterprises.\n\nLet\u2019s Discuss\n\n__Home \u00bb SAP HANA Migration\n\n## What is S/4 HANA Cloud?\n\nThe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) version of the SAP S/4HANA ERP system is the\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud. It is a suite of integrated business applications which\nallow company resources to be planned according to the company\u2019s needs. This\nsuite is also available with SAP S/4HANA Cloud as cloud ERP applications.\n\n\n\nThe SAP S/4HANA Cloud was first introduced in February 2017 as the\u2019\nintelligent ERP system of the modern generation.\u2019 The provider offers\nbusinesses a solution that does not rely on their own resources, such as\ninternal hardware, databases, and IT expertise, with an ERP framework as a\ncloud-based software version.\n\n\n\nUsers can connect their departments and functional areas digitally, digitize\ntheir business processes, and thus more quickly respond to new trends in\ngrowth.\n\n\n\nThe SAP S/4HANA Cloud runs on the SAP HANA in-memory database. This high-\nperformance analysis program, which was only available in conjunction with\ndifferent hardware prior to the SAP cloud solution, uses artificial\nintelligence, among other things, to analyze vast volumes of data.\n\n\n\nThe development and integration platform\u2019s in-memory technology enables users\nto access their data quicker and \u201cin real time\u201d to speed up processes.\n\n##  Why Migrate to S/4 HANA Cloud?\n\nBy giving you access to advances in data analytics technology, such as\nembedded real-time analytics, SAP S/4HANA can help your company realize its\ntrue potential. By using SAP Fiori, it will also provide you with the new user\nexperience. You also get better response times and better results from HANA.\n\nAs a company offering consulting services for SAP S/4HANA, we understand that\na large number of SAP applications will only be available on SAP S/4HANA in\nthe future. This will cause issues for businesses that are still using SAP\nlegacy systems. With cloud applications such as SAP performance factors, HANA\nincorporates the conventional ERP framework.\n\nAnother benefit of HANA is that an organization can open the doors to emerging\ninnovative technologies such as IoT, Big Data and blockchain by combining them\nwith SAP Leonardo.\n\nAnother strong justification you need to switch to SAP S/4HANA is that if you\ndo not move rapidly towards the new system, you will be left with an obsolete\nsystem by 2025. The earlier you make the transition, the faster you will start\ngaining from the new system.\n\n#### Move from SAP ECC to SAP S/4 HANA\n\nSmooth transition from SAP ECC to intelligent ERP with SAP S/4 HANA Migration\nto save time, tackle market dynamics, and smooth business goals.\n\n\n\n## Advantage of S/4 HANA Cloud Migration\n\nThanks to HANA\u2019s super-fast analytics engine, embedded reporting and\nstreamlined processes, you can easily gain real-time business insights for\nbetter decision-making, optimized processes and better services.\n\nRun faster in a more agile manner, thanks to the simpler data model of SAP\nS/4HANA and the highly intuitive user interface of SAP Fiori.\n\nAccelerate innovation to simplify and reinvent the business, as traditional\nERP with CRM, EWM, transport management, etc. and cloud applications, such as\nSAP Customer Experience, SAP SuccessFactors, Concur, SAP Fieldglass and SAP\nAriba, are combined with the central HANA center.\n\nIt can also be easily expanded with SAP Leonardo, SAP\u2019s digital innovation\ninfrastructure that opens the door to IoT, big data, blockchain, and more.\nOnly on SAP S/4HANA will a growing number of new SAP applications be\navailable.\n\n##  Sizing for S/4 HANA Cloud\n\nSAP HANA Sizing is a specific task that is essentially carried out to estimate\nthe SAP HANA system\u2019s hardware specifications, including major components such\nas RAM, CPU, and hard disk. Memory is the main component in scale and the\nsecondary component is the CPU.\n\nSo, once we have learned about the five-step ITERATIVE SIZING method, with the\naid of a practical example, it is easy to gain knowledge about SAP S/4HANA\nSizing. In this tutorial, if we deploy the on-premise SAP Fiori front-end for\nSAP S/4HANA as well as the back-end server, we will discuss how to size the\nSAP HANA landscape.\n\nThe question, however, is why do you need size for both front-end and back-end\nservers?\n\nSAPS/4HANA, which implements the SAP Fiori user interface in native mode, is\nthe response to the question. This SAP Fiori is browser-based and accesses\nback-end info.\n\n### On the Front-end Note\n\nThe SAP Fiori user interface is hosted on the front-end SAP Fiori server,\nwhich transforms OData service calls to remote feature calls and back-end\nservers. It is also the responsibility of the front-end server to manage\nadditional services in order to run SAP Fiori Launchpad smoothly.\nPersonalizing user accounts and login features are included in the activities.\n\n### On the Back-end Note\n\nThe back-end focuses primarily on the integration of OData services, which is\nan important step in enabling the SAP Fiori framework to access the back-end\ndata and to verify the business logic and conduct different activities.\n\n##  Best Practices for S/4 HANA Migration\n\n##### Get the right size for your HANA landscape\n\nThe most important step is the very careful sizing of the SAP HANA\ninfrastructure when designing a technical project plan. Oversizing can result\nin excess capacity and overloaded hardware, while under sizing may result in\nunnecessary delays that will increase operating costs.\n\n##### On the right platform, choose the correct migration strategy\n\nVarious platforms and methodologies are available that can be chosen based on\nbusiness requirements, capital, and budgets. On-premise or in the cloud,\nbusinesses can choose to run SAP HANA.\n\n##### Data cleaning\n\nReducing data size would allow the relocation of databases to take less time.\nIt is recommended that only essential data be retained in order to effectively\nconduct migration. Either the data in master data sets can be standardized\nbased on the information or the fields can be changed for information\naccording to new standard blueprints.\n\n##### Set elevated expectations for implementation\n\nAt this point, maintain distance from alternative routes and comply with the\nhigh and strategic norm. The key to effective migration is to be productive in\nall fundamental tasks, from preparation to migration. The migration team must\nbe aware of the requirements for professional migration.\n\n##### Doing a POC\n\nTesting the migration in a Proof of Concept (PoC) process before you pull the\ntrigger on the complete movement is a good idea. The PoC will allow you to\napprove the procedure for movement.\n\n##  Most Effective Methodology for S/4 HANA Migration\n\n#### Greenfield\n\nA new implementation of SAP S/4HANA is needed for the greenfield approach.\nThis can be a tiresome and time-consuming project, especially on the side of\nchange management, because you have to start everything from scratch. The\nbenefit of this approach is that you can redefine and simplify business\nprocesses and make full use of the capabilities of S/4HANA.\n\n#### BLUEFIELDTM\n\nPossibly the most widely used model is the BLUEFIELDTM approach that flexibly\ncombines the strengths of Greenfield and Brownfield. Large organizations need\nto overhaul some of their workflows and processes at the end of the day, while\nretaining some important customizations and solutions as well.\n\nYou minimize a lot of the risks associated with making the jump to SAP S/4HANA\nwith this automated software centric transformation approach. You can\nselectively overhaul some elements of your system, while still retaining those\nthat function at the same time that you clean and transfer your data to the\nnew system.\n\n#### Brownfield\n\nThere is an alternate path with all the implications of the greenfield\napproach: the brownfield path. For existing customers who are running on SAP\nECC and want to move to S/4HANA but still retain their investment in the\ncurrent framework, this is SAP\u2019s recommendation.\n\nYou will be shifting the entire system and business process to a new S/4HANA\nplatform with system conversion. If you do not want any changes in the\noperations of your business process, this approach could provide a better\nsolution.\n\n## Why choose Accely?\n\nAccely is a SAP Gold partner and has dedicated teams for SAP S/4HANA and new\nbusiness strategies for product growth, production and distribution.
