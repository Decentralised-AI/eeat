is around the move to SAP S/4HANA.\nWhile SAP has extended mainstream maintenance for the ECC 6.0 platform until\nthe end of 2027, with an optional premium maintenance available for an\nadditional three years, those running these solutions need to decide on the\nmove to SAP S/4HANA. The three biggest factors around this move are when they\nwill move, and how they will move, and where they will move.\n\n## **What Is SAP Migration Strategy?**\n\nWith the last major release of SAP ECC, version 6.0 EHP 8, made available in\n2016, the question facing SAP customers is around the move to SAP S/4HANA.\nWhile SAP has extended mainstream maintenance for the ECC 6.0 platform until\nthe end of 2027, with an optional premium maintenance available for an\nadditional three years, those running these solutions need to decide on the\nmove to SAP S/4HANA. The three biggest factors around this move are when they\nwill move, and how they will move, and where they will move.\n\nThe when is a question that is up to each organization. However, with the\nmajority of organizations taking between 12 and 18 months once the business\ncase has already been made, the period before mainstream maintenance ends can\napproach very quickly. Once the decision has been made when to move,\norganizations must then determine what approach they will take to their SAP\nmigration. Will they simply move everything as is into SAP S/4HANA? Will they\nstart from scratch to produce as clean a system as possible? Or will they take\nan intermediate route? The last factor is where they will move. With most\norganizations moving SAP workloads to the cloud, this may be the route of\nchoice. However, others will want hybrid environments or entirely local\ninfrastructure.\n\n**Key Considerations for SAPinsiders**\n\n  * **Understand what other organizations are saying about their SAP Migration Strategy.** These include: 1) the fact that the biggest challenge is often building the business case, 2) moves to a new ERP system are both resource intensive as well as expensive, 3) newer versions of SAP S/4HANA include significant business benefits, and 4) the move to SAP S/4HANA represents a major opportunity to improve business operations.\n  * **Ensure that you have planned effectively for the migration.** When migrating from your existing ERP system, there are important tips that you can follow to ensure that processes are successful. First, engage your business teams in the process. While this is an investment in resources, there will be more success with the overall project if your business teams are involved from the beginning. Second, remove unnecessary custom code. Limiting what you have to move forward will make the process much easier. And lastly, plan for a phased approach. You will want to have dry runs and even maintain both systems in parallel to ensure that they are working correctly.\n\nShow more\n\n## 37 results\n\n  1.     * SAP Migration Strategy\n    * Premium\n\n###  Partnering for a Successful Future\n\nReading time: 7 mins\n\nOrganizations need to prioritize innovation.
