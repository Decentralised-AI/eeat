Although\nSAP had announced 2025 as the initial deadline for the transition, it had to\nbacktrack after seeing lower-than-expected ERP adoption numbers from its\nusers.\n\nBut, given the current uptick in the number of users making the switch, it\u2019s\nsafe to say they won\u2019t be any other extension. This article will help you\nunderstand how to transition your SAP ERP to S/4HANA, whether you\u2019re deploying\nit from scratch or you want to bring along your data from ECC.\n\n## What Is the SAP S/4Hana Migration?\n\nIn 2018, SAP announced they\u2019d be sunsetting _Business Suite 7_ by 2025, but\ndue to an underwhelming response and a lack of experienced implementation\npartners, they had to extend their deadline. Users who\u2019re on _Business Suite\n7\u2019s_ ERP Central Component (i.e. ECC) now have until the end of 2027 to make\nthe switch to S/4 HANA. Past that deadline, SAP will only provide maintenance\nservices for BS7.0 at a 2% premium, on top of their existing 22% support fees.\n\n## When\u2019s the Deadline for Migrating to S4 Hana?\n\nWhen SAP released their initial 2025 deadline for the ECC-to-S/4HANA\ntransition, they had to change tack after the backlash they received from\naggrieved users & enterprises who felt the timeline was restrictive to\ntransition to a new platform and reengineer their processes from scratch.\n\nBut, given the growing rate of adoption by ECC users, there\u2019s no reason to\nassume that the deadline will be extended any longer. Or, as Paul Cooper,\nchairman, UK & Ireland SAP User Group, puts it, _\u201cSAP is being very strong in\nholding that line that [the 2027 deadline] will be the end or the beginning of\nthe end if you purchase extended maintenance which runs until 2030.\u201d_\n\nRECOMMENDED Article\n\nERP Implementation: 12-Step Plan to Success (2024)\n\nRead More \u00bb\n\n## Three Types of S/4HANA Migration\n\nDepending on what your current SAP deployment looks like, there are three\nstrategies you can use to make the ERP implementation and transition, to limit\nbusiness disruption, and make the most of the functionality of the S/4HANA\nplatform. There\u2019s no good or bad way to go about it\u2014it all depends on how long\nyou\u2019ve been running your setup, your existing workflows, configurations, and\ndatabase structure.\n\n### 1\\. Greenfield approach (ie. new implementation)\n\nA greenfield installation entails rebuilding your entire enterprise resource\nplanning infrastructure from scratch on top of the S/4HANA platform\u2014 process\nflows, workflow automations, integrations, and configurations\u2014without\nimporting existing system structures.\n\nAs you might expect, a greenfield deployment and software implementation is\nthe most expensive, and making the switch must include an aggressive training\nand adoption regimen to help your users familiarize themselves with UI\nchanges, workflow logic, and S/4HANA\u2019s tooling.\n\n **A greenfield migration approach is best for** : Enterprises with legacy,\noutdated SAP applications and infrastructure that is 20+ years old.\nEnterprises should take advantage of this time to fully reimagine and redefine\ntheir ERP processes, tasks, and workflows.\n\nThe Keys to a Successful Enterprise Software Implementation\n\n\u2192 Get the white paper now\n\n### 2\\. Brownfield approach (ie. full migration)\n\nSAP recommends a brownfield deployment (aka system conversion) for customers\nwho want to make the switch to S/4HANA but want to preserve their custom\napplications, workflows, and data structures, avoid costly disruptions to\ntheir enterprise resource planning ops, and instead, migrate and adapt their\nprocesses to the S/4HANA platform.\n\nNow, while SAP has released tools and published extensive documentation that\u2019s\ndesigned to help in-house technicians and implementation partners make the\ntransition a breeze, there\u2019s a significant chance that you\u2019ll encounter\ntechnical edge cases that can freeze your operations and delay you more than\nyou expected.\n\n **A full migration approach is best for:** Enterprises that are \u201call-on\u201d on\nthe SAP application suite and SAP implementation partners who\u2019re coming in to\nassist as third-party support.\n\n### 3\\. Hybrid approach\n\nThere are two different pathways a hybrid S/4HANA migration can take, namely:\n\n  * An empty shell migration, where you generate a copy of your existing system, excluding any live data, discard any configuration settings and programs you no longer intend to use & \u201crepair\u201d those you intend to use on S/4HANA, before upgrading and moving your data back in;\n  * A mix & match migration, where you run an S/4HANA instance and import your existing configurations and data into it, while operating your ECC instance concurrently until you\u2019re done\n\n **A hybrid approach is best for** : Enterprises that want to build certain\nparts of their new S/4HANA ERP from the ground up, use SAP applications and\npartners for some migration, but desire the flexibility and agility to\nintegrate best-of-breed applications and change processes in the future.\n\nRelated Resources\n\n5 ERP Adoption Challenges & How to Overcome Them (2024)\n\nThe Cost of a Failed ERP Implementation (+7 Infamous Failures)\n\nSAP ERP Adoption: 4 Challenges SAP Users Face\n\n## S4 Hana Migration Checklist for the Greenfield, New Implementation Approach\n\nHere\u2019s a simple, eight-step process to guide you through rebuilding your ERP\nfunctions on top of S/4HANA, from when you begin your gap-fit analysis until\nyour post-deployment adoption efforts.\n\n### 1\\. Discovery and research\n\nThe discovery process helps you define gaps within existing SAP BS7.0\ndeployment and understand how the S/4HANA platform can help you plug those\nholes, generate a positive ROI, and help your users streamline business\nprocesses. This is not a C-level task a few business intelligence managers can\nembark on\u2014you need to involve your entire organization, help them map their\nexisting processes to S/4HANA\u2019s improved functionalities, and try to build\nconsensus on how S/4HANA can change how they operate.\n\n### 2\\. Create an implementation and migration team\n\nAn S/4HANA implementation & migration team should include internal oversight\nin the form of an executive stakeholder, usually a C-level executive who makes\nkey decisions but doesn\u2019t get involved in day-to-day efforts and a hands-on\nproject coordinator who ensures the migration meets all the objectives set\nduring the discovery process.\n\nYour technical team should include migration architects, engineers, a project\ninfrastructure build team, and a project manager, developers, security\nadministrators, SAP Fiori developers, change managers, training leads, and\nprocess orchestration consultants.\n\n### 3\\. Explore S4 Hana and its modern solutions\n\nIn this phase, your ERP and IT team will explore and research S/4HANA and its\nimproved functionalities. This is where you\u2019ll realize the digital\ntransformation benefits of the projects and the value you can derive from the\nnew ERP. This will help you to identify how these new features and\nfunctionalities can improve your workflows.\n\n### 4\\. Document and map your current SAP business processes\n\nIn this phase, you\u2019ll map your existing processes, which will help you\neliminate redundant steps, automate repetitive tasks, and redesign processes\nfrom scratch inside S/4HANA.\n\n### 5\\. Build your custom configuration\n\nS/4HANA is significantly more powerful that BS7.0 & it empowers users to\ncreate SAP Fiori applications & deploy them to the S/4HANA cloud, create\ncustom business objects, enrich them with ABAP programs, and release them for\ninternal usage faster than BS7.0.\n\n### 6\\. Create an end-user onboarding, training, and support plan\n\nA well-rounded coaching program needs to reassure your end-users that they\nhave the proficiency required to maximize the capabilities offered by the\nS/4HANA platform. Given the scope of the platform, your training strategy\nneeds to meet users where they are and deliver helpful assistance with minimal\ndisruption.\n\n  * Use on-demand training resources to resolve queries with bite-sized videos and guides\n  * Embed content libraries inside the SAP dashboard where users can search through relevant product docs, help resources, guides, and bite-sized video explainer without leaving the SAP user interface\n  * Personalize training programs for your staff based on their role, location, skill level, and business use cases\n  * Use a learning management system to guide employees through an S/4HANA curriculum, track their performance over time, and keep them engaged with gamification, alerts, and rewards\n\nWith a digital adoption platform (DAP) like Whatfix, you can create in-app\nguidance and on-demand support content from your employees and end-users. This\nincludes creating product tours, interactive walkthroughs, field validations,\ntooltips, task lists, self-help wikis, and more \u2013 all overlaying on S/4 HANA,\nand all contextual to different user roles.\n\nWith Whatfix, you can provide moment-of-need guidance and support to\nemployees, helping to drive adoption, reduce downtime, and empower your\norganization to fully realize the benefits of S/4 Hana.\n\nDrive S/4HANA adoption with in-app, personalized learning & training flows\nwith Whatfix\n\nSee Whatfix for SAP in action now \u2192\n\n### 7\\. Deploy S/4HANA\n\nOnce you\u2019re confident that your S/4HANA setup is complete, you can go test it\nin a sandbox where you\u2019ll test run applications, observe workflows, and make\nsure custom objects are functional  before going live.\n\n### 8\\. Monitor use and track adoption\n\nA product analytics tool like Whatfix will help you track which of your users\nare engaging with your S/4HANA instance, how much, which features they\u2019re\nusing, and vice versa. Armed with that data, you can design better training\nprograms, set up your end-users with 1:1 SAP coaching, and emphasize the need\nto complete the training process so they can extract all the value the S/4HANA\nplatform promises.\n\nYou can also identify friction and pain points inside the platform, and create\nnew in-app guidance or help documentation to resolve those difficult-to-use\nareas in your new S/4 HANA platform.\n\n## S/4HANA Migration Checklist for the Brownfield, Full Migration Approach\n\nA brownfield S/4HANA helps you make the switch without sacrificing your\nexisting configurations and limits disruption to your business process\u2014but you\nneed to carefully coordinate the change management process, ensure the utmost\ndata accuracy, and build an extensive training infrastructure to make the\ntransition smooth.\n\n### 1\\. Align your SAP ERP migration plan with your business goals\n\nYour transition strategy should start by tying your desired business goals to\nS/4HANA benefits as it\u2019ll help you make the case for the transition, convince\nyour end-users to give you their full support since they\u2019ll understand it\u2019s\nnot yet another vanity digital transformation effort that\u2019s bound to fail.\n\nClearly explain how much S/4HANA can streamline your source-to-pay, plan-to-\nproduct, order-to-cash, and HR operations in terms of tasks that can be\nautomated, redundant steps you can remove, and the time it\u2019ll save.\n\n### 2\\. Prepare your system requirements and needs\n\nYour system requirements will differ, depending on whether you opt for an on-\npremise deployment or a cloud-based operation, your industry vertical (e.g.,\nretail, healthcare, energy, commodity management, finance, policy management,\netc.), the languages your custom applications are written in, company size,\netc.\n\n### 3\\. Create an SAP ERP change team\n\nYour change management team should include the process engineers, Fiori\ndevelopers, security administrators, and the application developers who\u2019re\nresponsible for coordinating the transition, building or tweaking\nintegrations, workflows, and custom applications inside your S/4HANA\ndeployment.\n\n### 4\\. Confirm all your integrations and add-ons will work in your new SAP\ninstance\n\nWhether they\u2019re published by SAP, a third-party, or were built in-house, SAP\nadd-ons can only run on the S/4HANA platform if they\u2019ve explicitly been\ndesigned to. To prevent this from becoming a bottleneck (especially for add-\nons that are critical to your operations), it\u2019s important to contact vendors\non time to notify them to prepare a compatible version or give you a timeline\nfor its availability.\n\n### 5\\. Custom code migration and installation\n\nSAP maintains Fiori Custom Code Migration App and ABAP Development Tools in\nEclipse with Quick Fixes, both of which are designed to help organizations\nswitching to S/4HANA to scope, analyze, migrate, and adapt custom code to the\nS/4HANA environment.\n\n### 6\\. Customize your S4 Hana configuration\n\nThe customization process includes basic settings that set the stage for the\nsystem landscape and data transfer, as well as other application-specific\nsettings and enhancements like customer exists, BAdIs, and individual\napplications settings. You can also:\n\n  * Define the origin and endpoints for logical systems and activate BTEs.\n  * Activate change transfer of records.\n  * Integrate your list of planning calendars from SAP IBP.\n  * Create business add-ins (BAdIs) that\u2019ll work with your S/4HANA master data.\n\n### 7\\. Spot-check data accuracy\n\nBefore you begin importing your data into S/4HANA with SAP Migration Cockpit,\nyour IT and Business teams should review the entries in your templates to\nensure accuracy. Additionally, it\u2019s important to:\n\n  * load import batches incrementally.\n  * use the DEV system to test loads before the TEST system.\n  * mark your master datasets with prefixes for easier tracking.\n\n### 8\\. Create an end-user onboarding, training, and support plan\n\nThere are several ways you can navigate the training and adoption journey\nafter your S/4HANA setup, including:\n\n  * Support\u2014on-demand content, such as video explainers, product documentation, guides, and articles, as well as live assistance from your implementation partners for edge cases where your existing support library can\u2019t help\n  * Onboarding\u2014Use step-by-step product tours that guides users through the S/4HANA interface, as well as tooltips, hotspots, alerts, and notifications that can deliver contextual updates quickly\n  * Training\u2014SAP offers training resources such as their openSAP program, Learning Journeys, Learning Hub, Certification Programs designed to get users to ramp up their proficiency on the S/4HANA platform, mostly for free.\n\nWith Whatfix\u2019s DAP, support your ERP end-users with various in-app guided and\nhelp content widgets \u2013 helping them to familiarize themselves with S/4HANA\u2019s\nUI and workflows, overcome friction points in the application, adopt new\nworkflows and tasks, and empower them to realize their full potential with the\nnew ERP investment.\n\n### 9\\. Deploy S/4HANA\n\nGo live across all departments where you have S/4HANA functionality. Be sure\nto keep an eye out for downtime, as well as user resistance or frustration.\n\n### 10\\. Monitor use and track adoption\n\nSAP is a complicated piece of enterprise software and it\u2019s understandable if\nsome of your end-users are slow to adopt S/4HANA\u2014they may not be forthright\nabout their struggles but their productivity will reduce noticeably. A product\nanalytics platform like Whatfix can help you track usage trends, monitor which\nfeatures users engage with, record sessions, and get a comprehensive outlook\non where your employees are struggling with the S/4HANA experience.\n\nHow a DAP Drives S/4HANA Implementation Success\n\nAccording to SAP experts, Brightwork Research & Analysis, a 1 \u2013 2TB instance\nof S/4HANA would attract a one-time bill of $6.2 million\u2014 and that\u2019s before\nyou factor in ongoing maintenance, training, etc.\n\nAt that price point, any users within your company who don\u2019t use SAP to its\nfull functionality are literally lighting money on fire\u2014but they won\u2019t until\nthey can learn how it works, at their own pace.\n\nWhatfix is a digital adoption platform that helps enterprise users make sense\nof complicated software products like SAP.
