In some cases it is\nnecessary. Often, however, companies decide to carry out such projects due to\nthe expected benefits, such as reduced total cost of ownership, an increased\nperformance and availability of the system and data security, as well as the\nflexibility resulting from virtualization.\n\nThe difficulty of the migration work increases if a hardware environment, an\noperating system and a database are also changed. At the same time, the most\nimportant aspects for each company are the security and integrity of data and\na continuous access to them, which is why the process of migrating the system\nmust have the support from the software manufacturer, and the whole project\nshould be prepared in accordance with its recommendations and standards.\n\nThe transfer of the environment with an SAP application is a process supported\nby the software manufacturer. SAP provides dedicated tools to migrate its\nsoftware. It also provides recommendations and procedures to carry out the SAP\nsystem migration process, and renders the services of support for its\ncustomers throughout the process, both in the preparation phase of the\nmigration project, during its execution and upon completion of work.\n\n###  **Migration types**\n\nThere are two types of the system migration in the SAP technology: a\nhomogeneous copy and a heterogeneous copy. The proper definition of a planned\ncopy type is necessary for the selection of appropriate tools and methodology\nof work.\n\nWe deal with a homogeneous copy when we move the system to a new platform, but\nto the same operating system and database platform as on a source platform. In\nthis case, a hardware architecture is the same as in the source system or it\nis a platform certified by SAP as a successor to the source platform.\n\nA heterogeneous copy is the SAP system migration to a new platform, with\nchanging the operating system or database, or even the operating system and\nthe database at the same time. During the heterogeneous migration, the\nhardware platform may also be changed. The heterogeneous migration, the so-\ncalled OS/DB Migration, is a much more complex process than the homogeneous\nmigration, and therefore it can be carried out only by a technical consultant\nwith a special OS/DB Migration certificate. In addition, for each migrated\nproduction system, it is required to submit such a project to the SAP support\norganization, and to carry out an SAP OS/DB Migration Check session.\n\n###  **Migration vs. upgrade**\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the SAP environment migration project is not\nan **SAP upgrade**. Due to the process complexity, migration should be planned\nand carried out as a project separate from other projects relating to a\nspecific system, e.g. an SAP version upgrade project.\n\nHowever, all requirements regarding the dependencies between a version of the\nSAP software and its components, operating system and database must be met at\nall times.\n\nThis means that in specific situations, it may be necessary to upgrade the\ndatabase version or even the operating system in the source system to enable\nthe SAP system migration to a new environment. The requirements of this type\napply most often when the system is migrated to a new hardware environment\nthat is supported only by a more recent version of the operating system or\ndatabase. The same dependencies apply also to the SAP system components, in\nparticular the **SAP Basis** module, so it may be necessary to perform the\nprocedure of updating this component prior to the migration procedure.\n\n###  **Project support**\n\nTaking into account the need to ensure in the first place the security and\nintegrity of business data, as well as the smooth running of the migration\nproject, SAP provides for its customer a dedicated **SAP OS/DB Migration Check\nservice**. This service is mandatory for the heterogeneous migration of\nproduction systems, while it is not necessary for homogeneous and\nheterogeneous migrations of non-production systems.\n\nAs a part of the **SAP OS/DB Migration Check service** , the following\nverification sessions are performed:\n\n  * Remote Project Audit,\n  * Analysis Session,\n  * Verification Session.\n\n **Remote Project Audit** : upon notifying SAP about a migration project, it\nis necessary to fill out a notification questionnaire. The questionnaire\ncontains important questions about the planned project:\n\n  * a name of the partner carrying out the migration,\n  * a definition of the source system: a version of the operating system, database, hardware,\n  * a definition of the target system: a version of the operating system, database, hardware,\n  * a date of the planned test migration and a date of the final production migration,\n  * a date of the scheduled preliminary session of the system verification: Analysis Session,\n  * a date of the scheduled verification session after the migration: Verification Session.\n\nIt is checked, for example, whether the partner chosen to carry out the\nmigration has the necessary experience and competence confirmed by a\nspecialist certificate. A technical side of the project is verified, that is,\nwhether the versions of the hardware, operating system, database and SAP\nsystem both at the source and target environment meet the requirements for the\nproject execution.\n\nAn important element is also the approval of planned dates of individual\nproject phases.\n\n **Analysis Session** : this is a remote verification session performed in the\nsource production system following the submission and approval of the\nmigration plan.\n\nDuring this session, the following is checked among other things:\n\n  * a production system in terms of the planned migration: versions of OS, a database, SAP instances, the configuration of the system landscape, etc.,\n  * parameters of SAP instances and the database\n  * performance of the production environment.\n\nBased on the above analyses, recommendations regarding the preparation and\nconfiguration of the target system are developed.\n\n **Verification Session** : this is a remote verification session performed in\nthe target system, usually about four weeks after the completion of the\nproduction migration.\n\nDuring this session, the following actions are performed:\n\n  * an analysis of the SAP system logs and database,\n  * an analysis of performance and response times for critical transactions,\n  * an analysis of performance bottlenecks in the system.\n\nBased on the data collected, an SAP consultant prepares optimization\nrecommendations for the migrated system.\n\nA good practice is to leave the source production system in the \u201cread\" status\nuntil the end of the verification session and confirmation of the correctness\nof the completed migration work.\n\n###  **When to migrate**\n\nCustomers decide to migrate their systems for very different reasons; below we\npresent the most common of them.\n\nIn the case of homogeneous migrations, these are:\n\n  * an upgrade of a hardware platform to the most recent version,\n  * connecting the system to or disconnecting it from McOD (Multiple Components in One Database) configuration,\n  * adding another system to the SAP environment landscape, e.g. adding a test, training, development system,\n  * changing SID of the implemented system.\n\nThe most common reasons for the heterogeneous migration are:\n\n  * replacement of a hardware platform with a new technology platform,\n  * increasing the performance of the whole environment,\n  * the benefits from new technologies available on other hardware platforms or database systems,\n  * increasing the system availability through clustering technologies available in the new environment,\n  * increasing the security and flexibility, e.g. through virtualization technologies,\n  * administrative facilitations resulting from the unification of SAP environments, e.g. SAP ERP, SAP BI or SAP Portal to form a single standard,\n  * adaptation of the SAP environment to IT standards applied in the corporation \u2013 standardization of hardware environments, operating systems or databases,\n  * reduction of total cost of ownership, e.g. reduction of license fees or hardware maintenance costs,\n  * anti-aging activities for the hardware platform, which not only ensure the increase in performance, but also reduce maintenance costs and prevent failures,\n  * ensuring the continuity of support from manufacturers of the operating system and database, which is usually provided for current versions of systems.\n\nThe presented reasons for the system migration show that it is sometimes\nnecessary and forced by circumstances, but very often it is a project that is\nsupposed to bring additional benefits or savings.\n\n###  **Virtualization**\n\nThe benefits of virtualization of IT systems are very large and result mainly\nfrom the flexibility of the administration of virtualized systems and\nincreasing their availability. Another benefit is achieved through the\noptimization of using the resources of the hardware in use. It is also\npossible to manage the access to the computing power of the hardware.\n\nWhen planning a new environment for the SAP system, many companies decide to\ntransfer their systems to virtual platforms certified by SAP.\n\nThis solution works not only for the production systems in use, but it is also\na very good option for archival systems.\n\n **Outsourcing of archival systems**  \nBCC (now All for One Poland) offers a service of comprehensive maintenance of\narchival systems based on the **All for One Data Centers **infrastructure. Our\nteam of IT professionals has experience in all popular technologies and a\nvariety of hardware and software platforms. We proactively monitor the IT\nenvironment and guarantee high security levels of customers\u2019 systems based on\nimplemented security standards: the Information Security Management System\ncompliant with ISO 27001 and the IT Service Management System compliant with\nISO 20000 and ITIL standards.\n\n###  **SAP archival systems**\n\nThe need to provide access to business data even for a few years after the\nsystem shutdown means for the IT department the necessary maintenance of an\nadditional environment that is no longer included in upgrade plans. Very often\nthis involves increasing costs of hardware maintenance due to higher fees for\nthe manufacturer\u2019s support for old technologies. In addition, the risk of data\nloss is growing due to an aging system that is prone to failure, or the lack\nof a platform for system recovery in case of problems.\n\nIt often turns out that the costs of maintaining an archival system are\ncomparable to or even greater than the costs of maintenance of a production\nsystem.\n\nVirtualization of archival systems optimizes the use of resources, reduces\nmaintenance costs and ensures the security of access to business data. In\naddition, such a system can be switched off or can operate on limited\nresources, and when it is necessary to make use of its data, this access is\noptimized and provided in accordance with the needs.\n\n###  **Competencies and experience \u2013 required**\n\nMigrations of SAP systems are complex projects that require careful planning\nand management and they must be carried out efficiently, but above all safely.\nSelection of an experienced partner with relevant knowledge, competencies and\ncertificates for such a project is not only a necessity arising from SAP\u2019s\nrecommendations, but also a guarantee of success of the entire undertaking.\nThis applies in particular to production systems, where the data security and\ncontinuity of access are the most important aspects, but also to archival\nsystems, where knowledge about and experience with operating older versions of\nthe environment are required.\n\n###  Recommended offer\n\nMigration to S/4HANA SAP ECC conversion to S/4HANA\n\n##  Any questions?\n\nContact us\n\nPlease leave this field empty.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nMessage*  \n\nConsent to the processing of personal data\n\n  1.
