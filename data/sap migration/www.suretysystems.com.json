Efficient data\nmanagement and migration is a crucial consideration for any SAP system\nimplementation, integration, or upgrade, as it helps free up human resources\nfrom tedious manual tasks and gives them more time to complete value-added\nactivities.\n\nThe primary purpose of data migration in SAP involves data extraction,\ntransformation, and migration from one system or file format to another.\nStill, it also facilitates better data quality for the exchanged information\nand ensures the data aligns with underlying business processes.\n\n_Here are the main requirements for data migration in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud:_\n\n  * Provide a comprehensive migration solution that requires no additional programming\n  * Create and map data structures between the source system and the target systems\n  * Migrate data from SAP and non-SAP software systems to SAP S/4HANA\n  * Customize and integrate relevant data migration objects across data sources and systems\n  * Reduce the human effort required to conduct testing and migrate data into SAP\n  * Minimize system downtime to maintain productivity and efficiency within the new system\n\n## **Understanding the Main Steps of SAP Data Migration**\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the main steps of data migration in the SAP S/4HANA\nlandscape:\n\n  1. **Extraction**\n\nIn the first step of the data migration process, users will gather all the\nrelevant business data to migrate to the target SAP system based on \u201crelevancy\nrules,\u201d or criteria like business value filters, dates, scope filters, and\nmore.\n\nRelevancy rules vary from object to object and are typically used to gain\naccess to in-scope records for a particular migration object or satisfy the\nconditions to move source data to a new system. Once the data is collected and\nthe relevancy rules have been outlined, users will create staging tables with\nrelevant migration objects and their associated segment names and relevancy\nrules.\n\n  1. **Transformation**\n\nThe transformation step is arguably the most critical step in the SAP Data\nMigration process, as it allows users to transform the relevant data extracted\nin the previous phase into a format that meets the requirements of the target\nsystem, such as structural design or process setup.\n\n_This step leverages additional business logic, mapping, and source fields,\nincluding:_\n\n  * **Default:**  This field assigns a default value to the chosen data field\n  * **Logical:**  This field applies condition-based rules to the chosen data field\n  * **Copy:  **This field allows for one-to-one mapping of data from the source to the target field\n  * **Cross Reference (XRef):**  This field assigns cross-reference tables to each data value to convert the source value into a format that aligns with the target value\n\n  1. **Preload Validation**\n\nThe preload validation process is completed after the initial data has been\ntransformed but before the newly transformed data is loaded into target fields\nand systems. These validations help users ensure data loaded into the new\nsystem meets system requirements and configurations, reducing the amount of\nretraced steps later in the process.\n\n_There are three main types of preload validations performed in the SAP\nsystem, including:_\n\n  * **Format:**  Performed to confirm validation checks for data formats, like date fields, pattern checks, and length checks for all the relevant data\n  * **Configuration check:**  Used to ensure necessary configuration requirements are maintained, and the system can load product master data and other relevant fields into the correct area of the system\n  * **Mandatory:**  Leveraged to validate if the system and business mandatory fields are populated with relevant business data or not\n\n  1. **Data Loading**\n\nThis step involves loading the data into the target SAP system using\npredefined load methodologies that meet business requirements. The data can be\nloaded into the target system by leveraging an in-built SAP tool, like the SAP\nData Migration Cockpit, SAP LSMW, SAP BODS, or an integrated ETL tool.\n\n  1. **Postload Validation**\n\nThe last step of the SAP Data Migration process is completed to ensure the\ndata is loaded correctly into the target SAP system and can be validated in\nt-codes and tables.\n\n_The post-load validation will generate three different results for the\nmigrated data:_\n\n  * **Postload Pass** : Reports that all records were successfully loaded with no errors\n  * **Postload Fail:  **Reports that some records failed and provide the error log for the failed records to conduct further analysis\n  * **Postload Change** : Reports that some field-level values were compared between source data and target data to ensure values were not changed or converted during the load process\n\n## **Support Tools for SAP Data Migration Scenarios**\n\nHere are a few additional support tools for navigating SAP S/4HANA data\nmigration:\n\n### **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**\n\nETL-based replication in SAP S/4HANA leverages SAP Data Services to migrate\ndata from a non-SAP source system to the target SAP HANA database. The ETL\ntool enables business users to access and view data at the Application layer\nand define specific data flows within SAP Data Services, improving overall\nconnections between SAP and non-SAP systems.\n\n### **Legacy System Migration Workbench (LSMW)**\n\nThe Legacy System Migration Workbench supports the transfer of data from non-\nSAP systems to SAP systems as either a one-time transfer or a recurring one.\nThe LSMW tool also facilitates data migration and conversion into the legacy\nsystem through batch input processing, direct input processing, and inbound\nIDoc processing.\n\n### **Batch Data Conversion (BDC)**\n\nBatch data conversion involves transferring data from the source system to the\ntarget system using a batch input program that can be executed through a call\ntransaction method or a session method.\n\nWith BDC functionality, users can transfer many data entries from a legacy\nsystem to an SAP system and automate manual data transfer processes across the\norganization. In the BDC method, only the data related to a specific\ntransaction is transferred into the correct data format, and the data can only\nbe transferred from the legacy system to the SAP system, but not vice versa.\n\n### **SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit**\n\nThe SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit leverages pre-configured migration content,\nmapping, and templates for each migration object modeler to migrate data from\nspecific SAP source systems to the SAP S/4HANA system.\n\nThe Data Migration Cockpit is designed for an initial data load, like SAP\nimplementation scenarios. Still, it is not configured to maintain data\nsynchronization between systems, facilitate a continuous data flow, or\nestablish a specific implementation scenario in SAP S/4HANA. This way, users\ncan gain greater insight into their relevant source and target structures and\nfields to identify and transfer the relevant data to SAP S/4HANA.\n\n## **How Can We Help?**\n\nWhether you need help outlining new implementation scenarios in your S/4HANA\nMigration Cockpit, additional support navigating the direct transfer of\nbusiness-critical data from legacy systems to a new SAP S/4HANA system, or\njust an extra hand using staging tables to model your migration objects,\nSurety Systems is here to help.\n\nOur senior-level, US-based SAP consultant team has the technical skills and\nfunctional know-how to handle all your SAP project needs, from implementations\nto integrations, upgrades, enhancements, and everything in between.\n\n## **Getting Started with Us**\n\nInterested in learning how the SAP S/4HANA Data Migration Cockpit and other\ndata transformation tools can improve interoperability between SAP systems or\nwhere our SAP consulting services can fit in your organization?\n\nContact us today to get started!\n\n##  You May Also Be Interested In...\n\nSAP\n\n### Your Guide to Maintaining SAP Material Master Data and Records\n\nIn the modern SAP landscape, where precision and efficiency govern the\nintricacies of critical business operations, the material master data and\nrecords assume an increasingly...\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nSAP\n\n### SAP MaxDB: Navigating Data Management in SAP Operating Systems\n\nIn the dynamic realm of enterprise database management, SAP MaxDB emerges as a\nrobust and versatile solution, playing a pivotal role in supporting the\ndata...\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nSAP\n\n### SAP STO: How to Drive Efficient Stock Movements Across Locations\n\nPrecision and efficiency are paramount in the intricate world of materials\nmanagement, purchasing, and strategic sourcing, and SAP Stock Transfer Order\nemerges as a linchpin...\n\nRead More \u2192\n\nSee All\n\n## Already know exactly what  \nyou need?\n\nFill out the form below and let\u2019s get started!\n\n  * Name*\n\nFirst Last\n\n  * Email*\n\n  * Phone\n\n  * Company Name*\n\n  * Job Title\n\n  * Technology*\n\nTechnologyHealthcare InteroperabilityJD\nEdwardsUKG/Kronos/UltiproInfor/LawsonSalesforceSAPWorkdayEpicOracle Cloud\nERPOther\n\n  * What's your situation?*\n\nWhat's your situation?We have a high-priority projectOur team needs an expert\nboostOur team is a man downWe're ready to team up with a new consulting\nfirmOur project is behind scheduleWe need an unbiased auditSomething Else\n\n  * Anything else we should know?\n\n  * CAPTCHA\n\n## Not sure how to get started with your project?\n\nWe\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nGet Started\n\nSurety Systems is an ERP, HCM, and CRM consulting firm specializing in JD\nEdwards, Lawson, SAP, Kronos, Workday, and Salesforce.
