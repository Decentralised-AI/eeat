The\ncloud migration packages are based on the data transformation platform\nCrystalBridge\u00ae, which automates the migration of SAP systems to the cloud,\ntherefore providing a fast and secure move. The packages include all costs\nthat are necessary for a successful data migration \u2013 software licenses and\nconsulting services \u2013 and the fixed price ensures highly reliable planning. In\naddition, the packages enable a particularly fast move to the cloud thanks to\nSNP\u2019s flexible, software-based approach: Depending on the complexity and\nrequirements, the time between the performing the assessment and gaining\naccess to the migrated SAP systems in the cloud is often less than six months.\n\n5/2/2021  |  3 min\n\n### Topics\n\n  * Press release\n\n### Share news\n\nThe three cloud migration packages are designed for different scenarios with\nvarying complexities. The first package enables a 1:1 migration of SAP\nlandscapes to the cloud (\u201clift and shift\u201d) along with the necessary SAP\nupgrades of the ECC systems, operating system and database changes, and even\nUnicode conversions. The other two packages offer a selective data migration\nto the cloud and a migration to SAP S/4HANA in a cloud environment,\nrespectively. In addition, companies have the option to add downtime\noptimization and the creation of a proof of concept for a test system. If\nadditional functions are required, the packages can be supplemented with\nfurther services and software modules from SNP. SNP offers each package in\nfour different sizes, depending on the system size and number of users. The\noffer is aimed at both direct customers and partner companies, which can\ninclude the packages in their offerings.\n\n\u201cOur cloud migration packages enable customers and partners to move to the\ncloud quickly, securely and in a highly automated manner with CrystalBridge\u00ae,\u201d\nsays Michael Eberhardt, CEO of SNP. \u201cAccording to its size and objectives, we\noffer each company the ideal solution package at a fixed price. In this way,\ncustomers benefit from highly reliable planning and won\u2019t experience any\nunpleasant surprises during the project. We are convinced that this will give\nmany companies exactly the security they need to take the step into the\ncloud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur primary goal in developing the cloud migration packages was to provide\ncustomers and partners with quick and easy access to SNP solutions,\u201d adds\nOliver Schwede, General Manager Central Europe at SNP. \u201cPartners can\nseamlessly integrate these packages into their own offerings to provide users\nwith an optimal end-to-end solution. At the same time, customers benefit from\na fast, secure and highly automated migration to the cloud with the data\ntransformation platform CrystalBridge\u00ae. This provides a manageable path for\nmoving to the cloud.\u201d\n\nFor more information visit www.snpgroup.com/en/sap-cloud-migration/packages .\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n**About SNP**\n\nSNP is a world-leading provider of software for managing complex digital\ntransformation processes.
