The need for a SAP S/4HANA migration before then is\nclear; many organizations have yet to embrace the change fully.\n\n## Why migrate to SAP S/4HANA?\n\nSAP HANA migration can provide numerous benefits for organizations. It offers\nimproved performance with faster processing speeds and increased operational\nefficiency, leading to real-time analytics and better decision-making through\nadvanced data visualization and insights.\n\nAdditionally, organizations can leverage the latest SAP technology and\ninnovations to stay ahead in their respective industries.\n\n## What are the benefits of a S/4HANA migration?\n\nSAP S/4HANA migration offers a wide range of benefits for organizations. They\ninclude improved real-time analytics, faster period-end financial closings,\naccess to the latest technologies such as AI, process automation, and easier-\nto-update business models. Ultimately, the choice to migrate to SAP S/4HANA is\nabout supporting a company\u2019s strategic objectives and staying ahead of the\ngame.\n\n### SAP Migration to S/4HANA: State of the Market\n\nPanaya\u2019s customer feedback shows that the S/4HANA migration ship is sailing,\nand everyone wants to be on it. Our findings align with the SAPinsider report,\nSAP S/4HANA: State of the Market. According to a SAPinsider survey, over half\n(52%) of respondents are currently in the evaluation phase of their S/4HANA\nmigration. This sounds encouraging, perhaps, but it also means that many,\nperhaps most, organizations planning a move from SAP ERP ECC to S/4HANA have\nnot taken more concrete steps to get there.\n\nAccording to the insights we gathered while talking to customers in various\nverticals (consumer goods, retail, manufacturing, and pharma, to name a few):\n\n  * Most SAP customers plan to take the system conversion (brownfield) path to S/4HANA.\n  * A major customer pain point is the evaluation (business case) phase.\n  * Project scope, resources, and timeline are difficult to evaluate.\n\nWith so many moving parts and new standards, complexity and risk seem to be\ninherent to every SAP S/4HANA system conversion. An ASUG and DSAG joint survey\naffirms that complexity remains a major barrier to SAP S/4HANA\nimplementations. Other challenges include delays that can be attributed to the\ncurrent COVID-19 global crisis.\n\n## What are common SAP S4HANA migration challenges\n\nSAP S4HANA migration can present several challenges that organizations need to\nbe prepared for, including:\n\n  * Data migration: Moving large amounts of data from legacy systems to SAP S/4HANA can be time-consuming and complex, requiring significant effort to ensure data accuracy and completeness.\n  * Customization compatibility: Customizations made in the legacy system may not be compatible with the new SAP S/4HANA system and may require rework.\n  * Technical compatibility: Ensuring that SAP S/4HANA integrates with other systems and ensuring technical compatibility can pose a challenge.\n  * Cost: The cost of migration can be high, especially if extensive customizations or integrations are required.\n  * Technical expertise: Migrating to SAP S/4HANA requires a high level of technical expertise, and a shortage of skilled resources can be challenging.\n  * Testing: Extensive testing is required to ensure the new SAP S/4HANA system works correctly and meets business requirements.\n  * Time: Migration can take several months to complete, and disruption to business operations during this time can be significant.\n\n## S/4HANA Migration Strategy -Three Approaches, One Goal\n\nThere is no single S/4HANA Migration Strategy that is appropriate for every\norganization. Some started clean by implementing a new system with no\n\u2018baggage,\u2019 known as a greenfield project. Others prefer a complete system\nconversion, a brownfield project because it doesn\u2019t disrupt their existing\nbusiness processes. And for those who want to consolidate their current system\nlandscape into SAP S/4HANA, there\u2019s the landscape transformation option.\n\nEach approach uses a different methodology and has its advantages and\ndisadvantages. Read on for an analysis of each approach and how to choose the\none most suitable for your specific circumstances.\n\n### The Complete Guide to a Risk-Free SAP S/4HANA Migration\n\nDownload Now\n\n### The Greenfield Approach \u2013 New Implementation\n\nA greenfield project is a new implementation of SAP S/4HANA. It is a golden\nopportunity to redefine and simplify business processes and take full\nadvantage of S/4HANA capabilities you may not have previously leveraged. While\nthis approach does not guarantee operational success from the start, there is\ntime to make necessary adjustments as the new system is implemented.\n\nNonetheless, the radical changes inevitably introduced in how you operate the\nsystem can be unnerving. And the re-implementation process can be tiresome and\ntime-consuming, especially on the change management side. So, before you go\ndown the greenfield path, be sure you\u2019re ready for an intense and involved re-\nengineering process.\n\n### The Brownfield Approach \u2013 System Conversion\n\nThe brownfield alternative is SAP\u2019s recommendation for customers who want to\nmigrate to S/4HANA but preserve the value of the time and effort invested in\nadapting SAP ECC to their needs. It is a conversion process in which you\nmigrate and adapt all your business processes to the new S/4HANA platform.\nThis approach is less disruptive and can offer a better solution if you don\u2019t\nwant any essential operational changes.\n\nA brownfield project runs the risk of possible technical issues during and\nafter conversion. However, SAP has provided specific conversion tools and\nguidelines intended to mitigate such problems from the start.\n\n### Landscape Transformation \u2013 Selective Combinations\n\nLandscape transformation is not a system conversion or a new implementation;\nit\u2019s selective SAP S/4HANA migration or consolidation of multiple systems.\n\nWith this approach, you can limit SAP S/4HANA migration to specific business\nprocesses while leaving the rest as is. Some organizations go down this route\nfor migrations expected to produce the best or fastest ROI, such as\nincorporating S/4HANA capabilities into their Central Finance business unit.\n\nThe same essential methodology, executed with the right SAP tools, can be used\nto consolidate SAP and non-SAP systems. Creating a single, centralized system\nreshapes your business landscape for more streamlined management.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**You might also like our blog**  \n **Greenfield vs Brownfield Approach on Your Move to SAP S/4HANA**\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n## How to Choose the Right S/4HANA Migration Approach\n\nTo choose the right migration approach, you\u2019ll need an extensive analysis of\nyour organization\u2019s technical and functional aspects to determine SAP S/4HANA\nreadiness. This includes evaluating the database, platform, configurations\ncurrently in use, your business workflows, the system landscape, and more.\n\nMore importantly, you should look at how the migration fits into your\norganization\u2019s digital transformation roadmap. Identify where you are now,\nwhere you want to go in the coming years, and how you plan to get there.\n\n### Steps to a Successful SAP S/4HANA Migration\n\nOnce the path has been decided upon, it\u2019s time to plan the exact ECC to\nS/4HANA migration steps needed for a successful implementation.\n\n### Greenfield\n\nThe SAP Activate methodology provides a clear structure and detailed series of\nsteps for the greenfield approach:\n\n**Discover** : Identify the value of your business and then develop the\nroadmap and strategy to be used in the implementation of the project.\n\n**Prepare** : Start working on final project plans and preparing your team.\nChoosing the right people for your team ensures the project will run\noptimally.\n\nExplore: SAP S/4HANA offers a wide range of solutions for your business,\nespecially for a new implementation. Initiate the scope evaluation process\nwith a Fit/Gap analysis \u2014 instead of traditional blueprint requirements \u2014 to\nensure a more efficient implementation.\n\n**Realize** : Focus on the business requirements defined in the previous\nphase. These include system configuration settings, integration scenarios, and\ndata migration.\n\n**Deploy** : Set up the production environment in this phase. When it\u2019s ready,\nexecute cutover activities and move business operations to the new system.\n\n### Brownfield & Landscape Transformation\n\nThe necessary landscape transformation or S/4HANA conversion steps are divided\ninto two phases: preparation and realization.\n\n**Preparation** : System Requirements & Planning: Conduct an assessment of the\nexisting system and then define the best possible solution to execute the\nmigration.\n\n**Conversion Pre-Check** : Ensure any add-ons or business functions active in\nthe current system are compatible with S/4HANA. (SAP has provided the\nSimplification Item Check for this purpose.)\n\n**Custom Code Migration** : Check your custom code for S/4HANA compatibility.\nThis is essential, especially if there are enhancements in your current\nsystem.\n\n**System Installation** : Start the conversion to SAP S/4HANA, including\ndatabase migration and data conversion.\n\n**Follow-On Activities** : All relevant, customized settings must be migrated\nafter the technical conversion.\n\n**Data consistency check** (especially for financial data): Since SAP S/4HANA\ncollects all relevant components from Financial Accounting (FI) and\nControlling (CO) into one data pool, called the Universal Journal, you must\nreconcile your accounting components so that data can be merged correctly.\n\n**Iteration Testing** : When all customizations are completed and all data has\nbeen migrated, you need to perform test iterations to ensure the system runs\ncorrectly.\n\n## 3 Steps to Ease SAP S/4HANA Migration\n\nTackle the most common S/4HANA migration obstacles with these three moves:\n\n  1. Use Value Stream Management to prioritize so you allocate resources based on added value for the end-user experience. Do not automatically assume your most challenging projects are also the most impactful ones.\n  2. Start building a viable business case well ahead of your move. Waiting until the last minute means you will have to pay the cost of indecision: technical debt, market share lost to competition, and a rushed insufficiently resourced migration project.\n  3. Connect with Panaya to learn how we can ease your journey to S/4HANA and ensure a quicker return on your technology investments.\n\n## SAP migration best practices\n\nHere are some best practices for SAP migration:\n\n  * Plan and prepare: Thoroughly plan the migration, including defining the scope, timeline, budget, and resources.\n  * Assess the current environment: To understand the existing systems, customizations, and data structures.\n  * Define the target landscape: Define the target landscape, including the desired functionalities, customizations, and integrations with other systems.\n  * Data migration strategy: Develop a data migration strategy that includes data cleansing, mapping, and validation.\n  * Test the migrated system thoroughly to identify and fix any issues before going live.\n  * Establish change management: Establish change management procedures to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the migration and its impact on their roles and processes.\n  * Re-evaluate customizations: Re-evaluate customizations made in the legacy system and determine if they are necessary for the new SAP S/4HANA system.\n  * Assign a dedicated project team: Assign a dedicated project team with the necessary technical and functional expertise to lead the migration.\n  * Partner with a trusted vendor: Partner with a trusted vendor or consultant with extensive experience in SAP migration to ensure a smooth and successful migration.\n  * Monitor and adjust: Continuously monitor the migration and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the project stays on track and meets the desired outcomes.\n\n## The Journey to S/4HANA Success Begins with Panaya\n\nPanaya, the leader in SaaS-based change intelligence and testing for SAP, has\npartnered with SAP in developing Panaya S/4Convert.\n\nThe solution provides the certainty and simplicity you need to start your\nS/4HANA migration journey, bridging the change management gap with valuable\ninsights and detailed reporting.
