Hence, examining all potential\nroadblocks becomes critical. This will help you stay on the projected timeline\nwith minimal business disruption.\n\nSelecting the right technology vendor does provide enterprises with a\ncompetitive edge. But the role that the people and process play in the success\nof a large modernization program cannot be ignored. For example, an SAP\nS/4HANA migration to cloud requires a significant change to business\nprocesses. And enterprises also need to work to drive adoption internally.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to consider every part of the process and the\nquality of the data you\u2019re migrating before starting a modernization project.\n\n## Putting Data at The Core of Your SAP Modernization ****\n\nSAP systems store and manage millions of transactional data records to inform\nvarious business processes for enterprises. Because data is at the core of any\nSAP system, enterprises should ensure that their data is fit for use during\nmodernization. This means enterprises must have data sets that can be trusted\nand leveraged to produce valuable insights. But it\u2019s important to also ask\nwhat constitutes trusted data? What are the data challenges organizations\nshould be aware of? And can data issues derail SAP modernization projects or\nimpact the overall cost of modernization?\n\nThere are many questions that arise when you are dealing with such a complex\nSAP transformation. To address these questions, let\u2019s look at five key\nconsiderations for enterprises beginning an SAP data migration to cloud\nproject.\n\n**1\\. Choosing a deployment option:** Implementing SAP S/4HANA requires\nparticipation from multiple stakeholders, depending on the technology layers\ninvolved. Enterprises must engage with the right subject matter experts (SMEs)\nand choose the hosting method that best suits their current SAP landscape.\n\nYou have many choices based on your needs when it comes to SAP modernization.\nThese include on-premises and private hosting, public cloud-hosted, partner-\nmanaged cloud or a SaaS version of SAP S/4HANA. Companies operating in a very\nregulated industry may choose a hosting option. On the other hand, companies\nthat don\u2019t have the time and resources to focus on infrastructure management,\ntechnical operations and application management may decide to implement a SaaS\nversion.\n\nMoving from on-premises hosting to the SaaS version offers peace of mind as\nyou have fewer issues or key decisions that you need to worry about. However,\nthere may be specific guidelines for each hosting method you need to follow\nwhile implementing the new S/4HANA platform. For example, in a SaaS version,\nyou are unable to migrate data or previous settings from legacy ECC systems,\nforcing you to adopt a \u201cgreenfield\u201d implementation.\n\n**2.  Implementing comprehensive data management:** The usability of ERP\nsystems like SAP depends heavily on the data they store. Throughout the\nmodernization, you need several data management tools to ensure data is fit\nfor use when it is migrated to S/4HANA.\n\nFor example, simply dumping all of your data to S/4HANA without any data\nquality checks will only deteriorate the performance of your SAP system. Your\nbusiness processes require comprehensive and accurate data about certain\nfunctions. This includes customer data or financial data. Strategic decisions\nbased on insufficient data will only hamper business operations.\n\nMigrating to SAP S/4HANA requires a conversion from a customer/vendor data\nmodel to a more simplified business partner model. This can create a lot of\ndata inconsistencies while building the data pipeline to enable conversion.\nAlso, S/4HANA as a platform requires a high standard of quality for the master\ndata you\u2019re migrating.\n\nThat\u2019s why when it comes to SAP modernization, it\u2019s critical to consider a\none-stop solution for all your data management needs. It should offer data\ndiscovery, data quality monitoring, data enrichment and data mastering across\nlegacy ECC systems.\n\n**3.  Consolidating ERP systems**: Some multi-national organizations have\ntheir critical data stored across multiple SAP ECC systems or other legacy ERP\nsystems due to their siloed operating nature or historical mergers and\nacquisitions. SAP modernization presents an advantageous opportunity for them\nto consolidate their data across legacy ERP systems, provide their global\nusers with a consistent message and streamline their operations.\n\nThese require data integration from multiple legacy platforms to transform the\ndata to a common standard. Then, they need to migrate that data to S/4HANA\nwhile making sure that legacy systems are also maintained for the whole\nmodernization period. With the change data capture (CDC) capability, data\nreplication can help automate the migration of all new data coming from legacy\nsystems to the new and modernized SAP system.\n\nData integration services are also critical to connect the modernized SAP\nsystem with other systems. This includes existing or new systems, both within\nand outside the organization. And it can help ensure a seamless data flow and\nend-to-end business processes.\n\n**4.  Democratizing data in S/4HANA:** Data scientists, data analysts and line\nof business leads often need access to enterprise data to fuel their key\ninitiatives. These stakeholders may spend most of their time finding the data\nthey need rather than leveraging required datasets.\n\nFinding the right data can be a complicated and expensive affair if all data\nrequests are forwarded to data engineers. An IT department flooded by\nindividual requests from many stakeholders will not be able to cater to their\nneeds.\n\nInstead, create a common data marketplace and automate the full process of\nrequesting data, managing approval workflows, data provisioning and data\ndelivery. This will enable you to create a data sharing culture and better\nmeet the expectations of your data consumers.\n\n**5\\. Driving adoption of a modernized SAP System** : A technology investment\nis only as good as its adoption. It will not deliver value to you if it is not\nbeing used by most of your intended consumers. Let\u2019s consider the two\ndifferent aspects of S/4HANA adoption. The first is around creating a robust\nchange management strategy. You should provide comprehensive training to all\nstakeholders to ensure they are proficient in using the new SAP system. A\nrobust change management strategy will facilitate the adoption of a new SAP\nplatform. It will also cater to any resistance from various stakeholders.\n\nYou also must focus on the intended use of upgraded systems and work towards\naddressing any challenges that may have an adverse impact on the expected\nbusiness outcome. In-memory computing in SAP S/4HANA enables real-time data\nprocessing. This allows users to access and analyze real-time data for faster\ndecision-making.\n\nHowever, a critical parameter to consider is to ensure you have clean and up-\nto-date data in S/4HANA. Data processing operations based on inconsistent and\nstale source data degrade its quality. This renders futile and ineffective\ninsights. Having clean and up-to-date data in SAP systems enterprise-wide\nhelps inspire confidence in the insights derived from that data.  \n\nEffective data management helps ensure that data is kept up-to-date and\nsynchronized across various modules in S/4HANA. This provides users with\naccurate and reliable information to make informed decisions. By ensuring data\nconsistency and data integrity, organizations can generate insightful reports\nand dashboards. This empowers users to gain a deeper understanding of business\noperations and make decisions faster.\n\nPay attention to these five key factors to deliver tangible benefits with a\nsuccessful SAP modernization effort. And here is a bonus tip: focus on\nautomating most of your data management tasks. Leverage augmented data\nmanagement capabilities to improve the performance of these tools.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFor your SAP migration to cloud, the Informatica Intelligent Data Management\nCloud (IDMC) provides a one-stop-shop for virtually all the data capabilities\nan enterprise needs.
