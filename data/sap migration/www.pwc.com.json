with SAP\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\nMark Shields  \nSAP S/4HANA and Cloud Transformation Leader, Partner PwC US\n\nRajdeep Sarma  \nDirector, PwC US\n\nRISE with SAP is designed to be a powerful\u2014but simple\u2014way to migrate to SAP\nS/4HANA and the cloud, without the overhead involved in a typical ERP business\ntransformation. By utilizing this streamlined Business Transformation as a\nService offering, customers are able to quickly engage with a subscription-\nbased version of the SAP platform, giving them painless, turnkey access to the\nlatest cloud technologies and features.\n\nBut while RISE with SAP represents a singular end result, there are a few ways\nto get to the finish line. With PwC\u2019s SAP transition framework, our goal is to\nhelp customers understand their options for adopting RISE with SAP and to help\nthem choose the migration approach that works for their particular needs.\n\nFunctionally, we look at three broad transition methodologies:\n\n  * Greenfield: Building a completely new installation of SAP S/4HANA, essentially starting from scratch and defining a wholly new operating model.\n\n  * Brownfield: Commonly referred to as \u201clift and shift,\u201d brownfield approaches preserve existing enhancements, customizations and data as much as possible by approaching the process as a system and data conversion rather than a replacement.\n\n  * Hybrid: A spectrum of options that create a vast middle ground, often replacing some systems outright while renovating and refreshing others. This approach uses strategies such as selective data migration and selective process renovation and transformation\u2014leveraging the best aspects of both greenfield and brownfield approaches.\n\n#### Key factors that influence the S/4HANA transformation journey\n\nDetermining which of these approaches is right for a customer requires\nanalysis, which we begin by analyzing the strategic needs of the enterprise.\nSome of the top factors that inform that analysis include the degree to which\nthe customer wishes to make processes easier or simpler, the desire to reduce\ncosts and improve return on investment and the need to improve reporting and\ndecision-making. We look at a total of nine strategic and tactical factors as\npart of our recommendation process. Here are some of the top factors that\ninfluence a company\u2019s transition decision:\n\n  \n  \n\n#### PwC benchmark results: Factors influencing the transformation journey to\nS/4 HANA\n\n  \n\nMake processes easier and simpler\n\n%\n\nImprove return on investment (ROI) / Reduce costs\n\n%\n\nImprove reporting and decision making\n\n%\n\nAutomation of controls, security operational risk\n\n%\n\nEnable restructuring of business operation and / or maximize shared service\norganizations\n\n%\n\nImprove cash flow\n\n%\n\nAttract / retain talent with digital work experience\n\n%\n\nImprove tax management and reimbursable processes\n\n%\n\nEnable or streamline Mergres, Acquisition and / or Disestiture\n\n%\n\n  \n\nSource: The Journey Guide to SAP S/4HANA\n\nWhen we examine the responses customers provide when asked about these\nfactors, we are able to hone in on the ideal transition methodology for that\ncustomer. Customers who want to support a future-friendly digital workforce or\nwho wish to simplify the enterprise data model (or operating structure) and\nreduce the total number of business processes used are more likely to benefit\nfrom a greenfield implementation approach. On the other hand, customers who\nwish to minimize the business risk of making organizational changes or want to\nreduce implementation costs are more likely to benefit from a brownfield or\nhybrid approach to adopting RISE with SAP.\n\n#### Typical transition scenarios  \n\nWhat does a RISE with SAP transition look like? Here are a few scenario\narchetypes that fall into our various frameworks:\n\n  * **Greenfield deployment:** A classic greenfield transition offers the greatest opportunity for process improvement and simplification, allowing the enterprise to align its operating structure with leading practices in the market. We generally recommend this option when the quality of data in the existing ERP system is low, or when the current enterprise data model (or operating model) and processes are archaic and inefficient. The goal with a greenfield deployment is to simplify operations by leveraging as many of SAP\u2019s out-of-the-box features as possible, with a focus on standardization and consistency. These deployments generally take the longest, making greenfield the costliest type of transition.\n\n  * **Brownfield deployment:** If an organization has effective existing processes and requires all (or most) of its historical data to be migrated intact\u2014generally for compliance reasons\u2014brownfield often makes sense. We generally recommend this approach when the total amount of data to be migrated is smaller, or when the organization simply has no appetite for change. Brownfield migrations can be done quickly, with minimal disruption to the business, but the overall benefits of SAP tend to be more limited once the transformation is complete.\n\n  * **Hybrid deployment (selective process and data transformation):** While PwC offers a range of hybrid solutions, a typical configuration might include one that maintains 30 to 50% of existing business processes and replaces the remainder with more efficient alternatives, selectively transitioning data as necessary. This type of transition is often recommended when multiple ERPs\u2014some working, some not\u2014are being consolidated on a global scale, giving the customer the flexibility to be selective about which processes and which data are worth keeping. It\u2019s less expensive and costly than a full-scale greenfield transition, balancing migration speed with ROI.\n\nThese are just a few examples of our recommended RISE with SAP migration\ntactics. Additional hybrid frameworks may land closer to a greenfield solution\nfor organizations that want to define a new operating model while leveraging\nexisting capabilities, or closer to a brownfield solution for organizations\nthat desire a quick transition\u2014making fewer architectural changes in order to\nbuild the foundation for a future transformation.\n\n#### How does PwC S/4HANA industrialization help organizations choose the\nright transition approach and execute for RISE with SAP?\n\nOur assessment framework, tools and industry benchmarks are designed to\nilluminate the many considerations every enterprise faces when it comes to an\nSAP S/4HANA transition, weighing numerous criteria to help guide the\norganization on the optimal strategic direction it should take as it begins\nits transformation process.\n\nIn order to help you get on the path to S/4HANA, PwC developed the S/4 Journey\nGuide, a survey-based assessment that can help you quickly determine which\nmigration option may be best for your business.\n\nPwC provides a customized transition offering to help organizations embark on\nthe RISE with SAP journey. Our program includes a vast collection of industry-\nleading frameworks, methodologies and toolsets, plus automation routines for\ncustom code remediation, selective data transition and business downtime\noptimization. Our goal at PwC is to help organizations reap the benefit of\nRISE with SAP in an expedited manner while minimizing overall risk.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about how PwC can help guide your\ntransformation and increase value as you implement RISE with SAP, contact us\nusing the form below.\n\n## Related content\n\nLoading...\n\n24/07/20\n\n####  PwC\u2019s S/4 Journey Guide\n\nReimagine your business and transform your enterprise\n\n11/06/21\n\n####  Unlocking business value through RISE with SAP\n\nWith our comprehensive support for RISE with SAP, PwC is ready to lead clients\nas they transition to SAP S/4HANA and unlock the value of the cloud.\n\nLoading...\n\nFollow us\n\nTrust solutions Consulting Tax services Newsroom Alumni US offices Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2017 \\- 2024 PwC.
