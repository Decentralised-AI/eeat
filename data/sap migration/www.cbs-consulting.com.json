But, if you are using the right tool and approach, we don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019ll be any problem with it.\n\nFor instance, you won\u2019t accidentally end up deleting your data, get inaccurate\ninformation, or anything as such. However, for that, you need to know what\ntools you need to use.\n\nLet\u2019s learn more about it.\n\n##\n\n## **How to Choose a Data Migration Tool?**\n\nThe technique of data migration usually depends on the requirement of a\nbusiness. Hence, the approach or the usage of tools would change in accordance\nwith it as well.\n\nFor example, SAP S/4HANA can help a business in reducing its IT expenses by\nstreamlining the SAP landscape it\u2019s using. Hence, to use it properly, your\nbusiness may prioritize financial data migration first to speed up the\nprocess.\n\nOnce it\u2019s done, then you can move your legacy data to complete the entire\nprocedure. This, in turn, will ensure that you are not losing any data or\ninformation in any manner.\n\nBefore you choose a data migration tool, here are a few things that you need\nto keep an eye on \u2013\n\n###\n\n### **1: Reliability  **\n\nWhen it comes to reliability, using a cloud-based tool will be perfect for you\nfor two reasons. Firstly, it can ensure an 100% uptime thanks to the redundant\narchitecture they come with.\n\nAnd secondly, they are much faster and efficient than a normal, efficiency-\nfocused tool. So, it can be ideal for you to complete the migration process\nwithin the given deadline.\n\n###\n\n### **2: Security**\n\nAfter all, the data migration tool will delve deeper with your organization\u2019s\npersonal data. So, it\u2019s better to opt for something with a higher level of\nsecurity, so that you don\u2019t lose anything.\n\nWhen it comes to security, you should also consider how you want to set up the\ntool too. You can either use a third-party tool with it or keep the tool as\nis. Either way works.\n\n###\n\n### **3: Scalability and Performance**\n\nThe cloud-based tools again trump most of the others in this aspect owing to\ntheir excellency in speed, accuracy, and meticulousness.\n\nIt can also help them scale down or up the needs of a user through a single\nclick or two. This, in turn, might improve how you are thinking about\napproaching your migration.\n\n###\n\n### **4: Data Destination and Source**\n\nThe source and destination of your data will solely be based on your needs.\nFor example, all of the self-scripting solutions tend to offer support to\nalmost any source or destination.\n\nBut, they won\u2019t be scalable enough. Due to this reason, they are considered to\nbe perfect for a small project.\n\nMost of the on-premise and cloud-based tools, conversely, can take care of\nseveral tools all at once. Therefore, they can be used while handling a larger\nand more time-consuming project.\n\n###\n\n### **5: Pricing**\n\nThe pricing of a tool can be varied due to the features it comes with. Apart\nfrom this, it might also get affected by some other factors, including the\nfollowing \u2013\n\n  * Service level, \n  * The source of destination, and \n  * The quantity of data being migrated through it.\n\nWhen it comes to using a SAP-based tool, you might not have to spend any\nadditional money if you\u2019ve bought their package. However, if you have any\nconfusion regarding anything, don\u2019t forget to go to their help center and ask\nthem about it.\n\n##\n\n## **Why Should You Opt for a SAP Toolset?**\n\nThere\u2019re several reasons that prompts most people to go for the SAP migration\ntoolset instead of something else. Keep reading to know more about them.\n\n  * There are more than one tool set available with SAP for both cloud and an on-premise environment. \n  * These tools usually follow the build and execution methodology, which can be driven with what you want to achieve with it.\n  * These tools are perfect for analyzing your data migration progression while it\u2019s being done. So, even if some issue occurs, you can always take care of it accordingly.\n\n##\n\n## **The Data Migration Tools of SAP**\n\nThere are several data migration tools available in SAP. Nonetheless, only\nthree among them are used more commonly. Here\u2019s what you need to know about\nthem.\n\n###\n\n### **1: SDS and SIS**\n\nOtherwise known as SAP Information Steward (SIS) and SAP Data Services (SDS),\nthis type of migration tool is generally used when you are \u2013\n\n  * Working with huge data volumes.\n  * Taking care of complex transformation requirements, such as de-duplication.\n  * Integrating a large number of targets and data sources.\n\nBesides, it\u2019ll also be needed when you are trying to create a report on data\nquality, either as a continuous or an one-off activity.\n\n**Note:** SAP Information Steward is a tool that\u2019s usually used for dashboard\nreporting, profiling and data analysis. Hence, it\u2019s commonly used and\nintegrated with SAP DS when a project has quality-related tasks and data\nassessments.\n\n###\n\n### **2: SMC or SAP Migration Cockpit**\n\nSMC, in essence, is a relatively new application launched by SAP. And it\u2019s\nbeen embedded in SAP S/4HANA too \u2013 both on-premise and cloud version. It\u2019s\nalso been positioned to use in the loading and transformation of data. So,\nthere\u2019s no need to integrate it all over again.\n\nSAP Migration Cockpit can take data held within a predefined data template\nformat. And, it is usually done in a staging database or a spreadsheet, and\nprovides value mapping and technical validation. Besides, it can report to any\ntechnical validation problems as well.\n\nSome of the core features of SAP Migration Cockpit may include \u2013\n\n  * Replaces the LSMW within an SAP S/4HANA target environment.\n  * Can load information by using the .XML format for the smaller data volumes.\n  * Doesn\u2019t require any kind of separate infrastructure, as it works on the same ecosystem as the data that will be loaded. SAP Transaction LTMC can start up the SMC.\n\nFurthermore, SAP Migration Cockpit can also load data by using a specific HANA\nschema. It is only used for larger data volumes, though.\n\n###\n\n### **3: SAP Agile Data Preparation**\n\nThe SAP ADP is a web tool, specifically developed by SAP, that can incorporate\nsimplified or unraveled versions of SAP DS. It, in turn, helps it to enable\nprofiling, deduplication, and data preparation properly. Moreover, it can also\noffer an extract and transform tool to complement the core loading\nfunctionality of SAP MC and works pretty well with limited data volume.\n\n**Note:** Most people think that SAP ADP and SAP tend to compete with each\nother, given their features and how they function in a system. However, it\u2019s\nuntrue.\n\nSAP IS, on one hand, is a full-fledged data prep tool and data quality\nmonitoring system that\u2019s installed on-premises. If you have the need for a\nmonitoring tool or data quality assessment, it might be best to invest in SAP\nIS.\n\nHowever, if the specific data migration procedure seems less complicated with\nminute data volumes, SAP ADP can be the poison of choice for them. The tool\nwill correspondingly boost the data and improve its quality accordingly.\n\n###\n\n### **Bonus: Smart Data Quality and Smart Data Integration**\n\nThe SDQ and the SDI are SAP HANA-based tools that can replicate and transform\ndata in an instance through remote sources. All of these are generally done\ninto SAP HANA and, hence, aren\u2019t really usable with the SAP S/4HANA version at\nall.\n\nSome of the features of the tool may include the following \u2013\n\n  * It can support loading to the HANA systems within a public cloud environment.\n  * There\u2019s no requirement of any separate or specific infrastructure, as it can run on the same HANA ecosystem.\n  * As a native HANA product, Smart Data Quality can process large volumes of data and information quite easily.\n\n**Note:** SDQ is primarily used to proffer reports on the quality of data and\nto auto-correct and enrich it. It can also be deployed alongside SDI to ensure\nthat you are integrating the data in a proper manner within your system.\n\n##\n\n## **The Bottom Line**\n\nMigrating a new set of data or something that existed previously on a SAP\nnetwork or system can be quite difficult. That\u2019s why using a data migration\ntool in a system will be a must.\n\nHopefully. we could provide as much information as you needed to make a\ndecision on your own. However, if there\u2019s still something else that you want\nto know, don\u2019t forget to talk with a consultancy service regarding the same.\n\nThey\u2019re more knowledgeable in this context and, hence, can offer more\ninformation through a call or a professional meet-up.\n\n## further articles\n\n#### Strategic Master Data Management\n\n__\n\nRead more\n\n#### cbs.zero: What are the European Sustainability Reporting Standards\n(ESRS)?\n\n__\n\nRead more\n\n#### cbs Innovation Award: Transforming Challenges into Real Added Value\n\n__\n\nRead more\n\nShow sitemap __ Close sitemap __\n\n  * Contact\n  * Imprint\n  * Data privacy\n  * GTC\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\nShow sitemap __ Close sitemap __\n\n  * NEXT ONE\n  * Innovation zur\u00fcck\n    * **NEXT ONE Business Solutions**\n    * Sustainable Supply Chain & Manufacturing\n    * Corporate Finance, Steering & Compliance\n    * Customer Journey Management\n    * Human Experience Management\n    * cbs.zero\n    * **NEXT ONE Business Technologies**\n    * Enterprise Integration\n    * Business Intelligence & Analytics\n    * Business Technology Platform\n    * Industry Applications\n  * Transformation zur\u00fcck\n    * SAP S/4HANA zur\u00fcck\n      * Transform to the Cloud\n      * Pre-Study\n      * New Implementation (Greenfield)\n      * Selective S/4HANA Transition\n      * S/4HANA Conversion (Brownfield)\n      * Public Sector Conversions\n    * Landscape Transformation\n    * Business Process Management\n    * Transformation Software\n    * Method M-cbs\n    * Change Management\n    * Mergers, Acquisitions, & Divestitures\n  * Expertise zur\u00fcck\n    * Business\n\nzur\u00fcck\n\n      * Application Management Services\n      * Business Process Management\n      * CRM with Salesforce\n      * E-Invoicing\n      * Finance\n      * Global SAP Rollouts\n      * Global Trade Services\n      * Human Experience Management\n      * Logistics\n      * Master Data Management\n      * Supply Chain Planning\n    * Technology\n\nzur\u00fcck\n\n      * Authorizations\n      * Business Technology Platform\n      * Business Intelligence\n      * Enterprise Integration\n      * Industry Applications\n      * SAP Basis\n      * System Landscape Transformation\n      * Technology Consulting\n      * UX & UI\n  * About cbs zur\u00fcck\n    * cbs\n    * Cloud Partners\n    * Customers\n    * CSR\n    * News & Blog\n    * Events & Webinars\n    * ONE.CON\n    * Locations\n  * Career zur\u00fcck\n    * Get to know cbs\n\nzur\u00fcck\n\n      * Our spirit\n      * Our culture \u2013 The Power of Orange\n      * Development Platform\n      * Education and Training\n      * Modern working environment\n      * Space for exchange\n      * Summer Summit 2023\n      * Careers at cbs\n    * Job areas\n\nzur\u00fcck\n\n      * Overview\n      * Career in IT Technology Consulting\n      * Career in Business Consulting\n      * Career in Inhouse Consulting\n      * Corporate Functions\n    * Young Professional Academy\n    * Job Openings\n    * Application process\n\nData protection preferences\n\nWe need your consent before you can continue to visit our website.If you are\nunder the age of 16 and wish to give your consent to optional services, you\nmust ask your parent or guardian for permission.
