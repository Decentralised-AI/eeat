They range from the\nintroduction of new software to the digitization of analog processes or\ncomplete technology changes. However, all data migrations have one thing in\ncommon: In order to make a data transfer successful, existing information must\nbe adapted to a new data structure.\n\nData migrations are not only a necessary evil, but also offer great\nopportunities for business. They represent an ideal opportunity to clean up\nand tidy up old data stocks and, if necessary, to enrich them with external\ninformation.\n\n## Strategy and goals\n\nNo matter what the exact reason for a data migration is, it's usually about\nimproving performance and competitiveness. But you have to get it right. Less\nsuccessful data migrations can result in inaccurate data with redundancies and\nimponderables. This can happen even with fully usable and appropriate source\ndata. In addition, problems that were already present in the source data can\nhave an increased impact when migrating to a new, more complex system.\n\nWith a comprehensive strategy, you can ensure that a data migration runs\nsmoothly and that problems are considered and resolved in advance.\n\n## A strategic data migration plan should consider the following factors:\n\n  * **Perform data migrations as a separate project**  \nA data migration must be carried out gradually and systematically as an\nindependent project. If a data migration is treated as an independent project,\ntools and methods are usually available to correctly plan, control and monitor\nprocesses.\n\n  * **Involve departments**  \nNobody knows their data better than the user - the specialist department. No\nmigration can therefore be carried out by IT staff alone. Specialist\ndepartments should be involved in processes and informed about them from the\nvery beginning. They can also take responsibility for the quality of the data.\nProblem cases and subsequent analyses can be prevented or at least limited.\n\n  * **Knowledge of the data**  \nPrior to data migration, the source data must be subjected to a complete\ncheck. If this step is omitted, unexpected problems may occur. It is therefore\nadvisable to schedule the time of the data check correctly.\n\n  * **Cleanup**  \nIf you have identified problems with the source data, they must be corrected.\nThis may require additional software tools and resources.\n\n  * **Maintenance**  \nData gets worse and worse over time and therefore unreliable. Therefore,\ncontrols must be in place to maintain data quality.\n\n  * **Governance**  \nData quality tracking and reporting are important because they provide a\nbetter understanding of data integrity. The processes and tools used to\nprovide this information should be user-friendly and include automated\nfunctions.\n\n\n\n## Typical procedures for a data migration\n\nThere are different migration types and tools (like Data Services, Migration\nCockpit or other ETL tools) to extract and migrate data from source systems.\nWhich tool is the better choice depends strongly on your personal situation.\n\n  * Is it an initial load?\n  * Do data from multiple systems need to be consolidated?\n  * Should the data be enriched with external data?\n  * Is a duplicate check necessary?\n  * etc.\n\n\n\n## More information and offerings on data migration\n\nBlog\n\n### What companies need to do for successful data migration\n\nWhen companies implement new business software such as an ERP system, they\nneed to move their data from the old system to the new one. Often, however,\ninsufficient attention is paid to data migration \u2013 resulting in project\ndelays, higher costs and a negative impact on day-to-day operations.\n\nRead more\n\nBlog\n\n### 5 tips for a successful data migration: How to make the move a success\n\nData is invaluable to companies in the digital age. In the complex IT\nlandscapes of companies, they are available in different formats, on different\ndata storage devices and in various data systems.\n\nRead more\n\nBlog\n\n### Quality comes first: Challenges in data maintenance\n\nData is the most important raw material of the 21st century. Everyday business\nlife is full of situations in which data plays a central role. When\nintroducing new software based on master data, business partners, customer\naddresses and the material master must be properly maintained so that the\nsubsequent processes run smoothly.\n\nRead more\n\n###\n\n**Are you currently thinking about how you can migrate your data quickly and\nsecurely?**\n\n## Our offer for you:\n\n  * Pre-analysis workshops\n  * Extraction of data from source systems\n  * Data validation\n  * Data Enrichment\n  * Data cleansing\n  * Data migration test system\n  * GoLive\n  * Delta Load\n  * Hypercare\n  * Fullservice Data migration\n\n## Interested?\n\nSimply fill out the form and submit it.
