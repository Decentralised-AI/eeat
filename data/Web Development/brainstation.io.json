It may, however, also include web\ndesign, web programming, and database management.\n\nWeb development is closely related to the job of designing the features and\nfunctionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved\nfor the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming\nof sites).\n\nThe basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and\nJavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to \u201cmanage\u201d or\nfacilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done\n\u201cfrom scratch\u201d by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS)\nfall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and\nAdobe Experience Manager, among others.\n\n## What Exactly is Web Development?\n\n  \nWeb development is closely related to the job of designing the features and\nfunctionality of websites and apps (often called \u201cweb design\u201d), but the \u201cweb\ndevelopment\u201d term is usually reserved for the actual construction and\nprogramming of websites and apps.\n\nThink of all the web pages you have used over the years \u2013 Web Developers built\nthose sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that\nallowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines\nof code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the\ntasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.\n\n## Web Development vs. Web Design\n\nThough there is overlap, there are also key differences between web\ndevelopment and web design. Let\u2019s take a closer look:\n\n**Web Designers:**\n\n  * Create everything a user sees on a website or software product, including all visual, color, typography, and usability elements\n  * Work directly with a client to create designs or work as part of a team to develop client vision\n  * May need knowledge of a programming language or some coding skills, or at least some level of familiarity with widely used languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript\n  * Create wireframes and prototypes to test design ideas, offer input on design logos, branding, company style guides\n\n**Web Developers:**\n\n  * Write the code that makes a website function, whether they work on the front end or back end (server-side)  \n\n  * Create or implement designs demanded by a client or created by a design team\n  * Need expert-level knowledge of a variety of programming languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries\n  * Rarely create mockups, select typography, or pick color palettes\n\n## What Are the Most Common Programming Languages?\n\nThe most common programming languages involved in web development are:\n\n  * HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)\n  * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)\n  * JavaScript\n\n## Types of Web Development\n\nThere are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end\ndevelopment, and full-stack development.\n\n## What Is Front-End Development?\n\nFront-end development involves the \u201cclient-facing\u201d side of web development.\nThat is to say usually, front-end web development refers to the portion of the\nsite, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-\nEnd Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks\nand \u201cfeels,\u201d which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.\n\nFront-End Web Developers focus on translating website design and visual ideas\ninto code. A front-end Software Developer takes the design ideas created by\nothers on web development teams and programs them into reality, acting as a\nbridge between design and technology.\n\nFront-End Developers will usually need to possess a solid understanding of\nprogramming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as\nframeworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS.\nResponsibilities of a Front-End Developer would include creating responsive\nwebsites (that look and function well on any device), conducting website\ntesting and fixing any bugs detected along the web development process, and\nensuring site structure follows SEO best practices.\n\n### Front-End Development Jobs\n\nUnlike back-end development, there are a number of job titles that cover\ndifferent skill sets and experience levels within front-end development,\nincluding:\n\n  * Front-End Developer\n  * Front-End Engineer\n  * CSS/HTML Web Developer\n  * Front-End Web Designer (this usually denotes a role that involves more visual and interaction design requirements)\n  * Front-End User Interface Developer (covering interaction design skills)\n\n  * Mobile Front-End Web Developer\n  * Front-End SEO Expert (usually denoting a Developer with experience incorporating SEO strategy)\n  * Front-End Accessibility Expert\n  * Front-End Dev Ops\n  * Front-End QA (involving unit testing, functional testing, user testing, and A/B testing)\n\n## What Is Back-End Development?\n\nIf Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-\nEnd Developers are focused on how it works. A Back-End Developer creates the\nbasic framework of a website before maintaining it and ensuring it performs\nthe way it should, including database interactions, user authentication,\nserver, network and hosting configuration, and business logic. Working behind\nthe scenes \u2013 or server-side \u2013 Back End Developers are concerned with the\nsystems and structures that allow computer applications to perform as desired.\n\nThe primary responsibility of Back-End Developers is to ensure the\nfunctionality of the site, including its responsiveness and speed. To do that,\nBack-End Developers have to know how to build servers with modern frameworks\n(while developing custom APIs and serving static websites and files), and how\nto manage databases and data on a web server.\n\nTypically, Back-End Developers use server-side programming languages,\nincluding PHP, Ruby, and Python, as well as tools including MySQL, Oracle, and\nGit.\n\n## What Is a Full-Stack Developer?\n\nA Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end\ndevelopment. Full Stack Developers usually understand a wide variety of\nprogramming languages and because of their versatility, they might be given\nmore of a leadership role on projects than developers who specialize. They are\ngeneralists, adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of\ndevelopment. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers \u2013\naccording to an Indeed study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.\n\nIf the title is contentious, it\u2019s in the generalist nature of the position.\nDevelopers who specialize in the front-end or back-end often bristle at the\nnotion that someone could be equally adept at both \u2013 the expression \u201cjack-of-\nall-trades, master of none\u201d comes to mind.\n\n\u201cMy defensive tendencies are normally put on high alert when I hear that magic\nphrase (\u2018full-stack\u2019),\u201d wrote Front-End Developer Andy Shora. \u201cStacks are a\nlot bigger than what they used to be, and being able to claim one has acquired\nrefined skills at every layer of web development is certainly not a small\nclaim. Does this mean you have a broad range of skills or you specialize in\neverything?\u201d\n\nWhile that perception persists, there still is an increasing number of tech\nprofessionals who consider themselves Full-Stack Developers. According to a\nrecent Stack Overflow survey of Developers, 48.2 percent consider themselves\nFull-Stack Developers.\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is whether Developers are now expected to possess a broader\nskillset, or if Developers are taking it upon themselves to understand\nfunctions at both the front-end and back-end. Either way, it\u2019s becoming\nincreasingly important for aspiring Developers to have a foundation in both.\n\n\u201cFor most people hoping to break into web improvement, you should center\naround working up an establishment in both front-end and back-end advancement\nfirst,\u201d recommended Software Engineer and Tech Writer Muhammad Anser. \u201cAt that\npoint, you can float towards a claim to fame later on.\u201d\n\nAnd with demand for Developers expected to grow 15 percent by 2026 (for 24,400\nnew jobs), much faster than the U.S. average rate of job growth, there may not\nbe a better time to dive in and learn more about all the layers of Web\nDevelopment.\n\nPrevious\n\nWeb Developer\n\nNext\n\nWhat Does a Web Developer Do?\n\nGET STARTED\n\n## Kickstart Your Web Developer Career\n\nWe offer a wide variety of programs and courses built on adaptive curriculum\nand led by leading industry experts.\n\n  * Work on projects in a collaborative setting\n\n  * Take advantage of our flexible plans and scholarships\n\n  * Get access to VIP events and workshops\n\nSpeak to a Learning Advisor\n\n### RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR WEB DEVELOPER\n\nBootcampWeb Development Bootcamp\n\nThe Web Development bootcamp is an intensive, hands-on learning experience,\ndesigned to introduce the skills and concepts required to build modern web\napplications.\n\nCertificateWeb Development Course\n\nThe part-time Web Development course is designed to provide a crash course in\nweb development, with introductions to HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.\n\nWe use cookies to improve your experience on our site, and to deliver\npersonalized content.
