Rollups\n\n## Published on:\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nA Deep Dive into Rollups-as-a-service (RaaS)\n\n######  Dr. Ravi Chamria\n\n  * September 15, 2023 \n\n## Share\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\nThere has been a great buzz around Rollups-as-a-service in the blockchain\nspace. That\u2019s because RaaS empowers web3 enterprises to easily build Rollups\nchains with increased transaction speed and lower costs. Further, Rollup-as-a-\nservice platforms do not require heavy infrastructure and extensive resources\nto launch Rollups; instead, they offer a quick build and deployment approach\nthrough Rollup SDKs and plug-n-play tools.\n\nAs we know, the blockchain space is hampered by the biggest trilemma\u2014\nscalability. For example, we have witnessed the situation of the Crypto\nKitties congestion crisis that occurred due to over 2-4 billion transactions\noccurring in a single day, which led to the freezing of 30,000 transactions.\nNow that the demand for innovative decentralized applications (dApps)is\ngrowing significantly, this scalability issue of Layer-1 blockchains becomes a\nbarrier to adoption.  \n\nThat\u2019s why Layer-2 scaling solutions\u2013 Rollups existed and they are now rising\nin demand. Knowing this, numerous web3 infrastructure providers have started\noffering Rollups-as-a-service, simplifying the creation, deployment, and\nmanagement of Rollup-based chains. Let\u2019s dive deeper into the Rollups-as-a-\nservice (Raas) concept to understand its advantages, types, working mechanism,\nuse cases, and more.\n\nHowever, to understand Rollups-as-a-service, you must be familiar with the\nconcept of Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains and AppChains. If you want to learn\nabout these concepts, read our all-inclusive guide below:\n\n**Also Read:Comprehensive Guide on Layer 2, Sidechains and AppChains **\n\n## Understanding Rollups and Its Advantages\n\nRollups are the scaling solution designed to tackle the scalability issues of\nLayer-1 blockchain networks, enabling a faster, cheaper, and highly\nsustainable blockchain ecosystem for dApps. Rollups process the bulk of\nblockchain transactions on a separate faster network (Layer-2s), bundle the\ntransactions into a single rollup, and then port the bundled transactions back\non the main blockchain (Layer-1) at a minimal gas fee cost.\n\nThis approach of computing transactions off-chain could be beneficial for a\nlot of web3 applications in many ways. For example, it increases the\ntransactions throughput capacity of the parent chain, and provides a more\neconomical and sustainable ecosystem for dApp development while maintaining a\nhigh degree of security and full decentralization on Layer-2 by inheriting the\nsecurity from the main Layer-1 chain.\n\nPolygon zkEVM, zkSync, and Scroll are the top projects offering Rollups to\nscale Layer-1 blockchains. Most Rollup solutions are Ethereum-compatible,\nallowing seamless integration with existing dApps and smart contracts.\n\n## What is Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS)?\n\nRollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a comprehensive stack that allows web3\nenterprises and dApp projects to build, deploy, and maintain their customized,\nproduction-grade Rollup chains and AppRollups (application-specific Rollups)\nin a less complex and hassle-free way.\n\nRaaS essentially provides an abstraction layer over the complex approach of\nlaunching Rollups using SDKs and frameworks. RaaS works similarly to software-\nas-a-service products that do not require users to manage complex hardware and\nsoftware infrastructure or need hosting of any service on their end.\n\nLikewise, rollup-as-a-service products are created to eliminate the\ncomplexities of building AppRollups from scratch using SDKs and frameworks,\nwhich include infrastructure management, operating nodes, or programming heavy\ncodes. Instead, developers are provided with a dashboard-like platform and\nadvanced tooling that enable the launch of custom Rollups within a few clicks\nwith no reliance on intensive engineering or gathering technical expertise\nabout complicated Rollups stack.  \n\n## Types of Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS)\n\nThere are two main types of Rollups-as-a-Service \u2014 Optimistic rollups and ZK-\nRollups that are widely adopted by blockchain projects. Both these Rollups\noffer unique benefits, hence, enterprises can choose one that aligns perfectly\nwith their project requirements.\n\nOptimistic Raas refers to the stack that Layer-1, L2, and Appchains use to\nimplement Optimistic Rollup on their blockchain ecosystem. Transactions in the\ncase of Optimistic are processed on a separate Layer-2 network, and then\nbatched transactions are submitted to Ethereum or Layer-1 mainnet, assuming\nthat the transactions are valid. Here, two parties are involved\u2013 one that\nsubmits the rolled-up transaction on mainnet and another that submits fraud-\nproof for those transactions. Both these parties have their token staked on\nthe main network. If any invalid transactions are spotted, a dispute\nresolution will be conducted using their tokens. However, the chances of\ninvalid transactions are rare in Optimistic Rollup since it adopts a dual-\nvalidation model. Popular optimistic rollup solutions are Arbitrum, Optimism,\nand Boba network.\n\n ZK-Raas refers to a solution that allows the implementation of zkRollups for\nblockchains and AppChains. Unlike Optimistic, zkRollups does not offer a\ndispute resolution mechanism. Instead, it is based on advanced cryptography\ntechnology\u2014 Zero-Knowledge proofs. Within this model, the batches of rolled-up\ntransactions include a cryptographic proof called SNARK ( Succinct Non-\nInteractive Argument of Knowledge ), which is undertaken and verified by\ncontract deployed on the main L1 blockchain. This means that a validity proof\nof transactions must be submitted on the main network, making Rollups quicker\nand more efficient. Prominent zero-knowledge rollup solutions are Polygon\nHermez, Starkware, zkSync, and Loopring.\n\n## How Does Rollups-as-a-Service Work?\n\nRaaS offers a complete set of scaling services that allows web3 developers to\ncreate and implement custom Rollups. Following is a simplified overview of how\nRollups-as-a-Service typically works:\n\n  * **Projects onboarding** : Web3 projects can quickly sign up with a RaaS platform and gain access to their complete stack of SDKs, templates, and plug-n-play tools.\n  * **Customization:** Rollupus-as-a-service platform supports full customization of Rollups chains based on project\u2019s specific needs. Customization can include adjusting the security parameters, increasing the transaction processing capacity, setting transaction fees, and modifying the performance standards.\n  * **Integration of tools and frameworks** : Rollups-as-a-service platforms allow for seamless integration tools, libraries, and SDKs that web3 projects can use within their dApps or Rollup-based networks.\n  * **Monitoring and Maintenance** : RaaS providers offer monitoring and maintenance services to ensure the optimal performance and security of the Rollup solution.\n  * **Scaling and upgrade:** As a project expands, RaaS platforms allow developers to scale the Rollup network according to the changing requirements.\n\n## How Web3 Projects Can Utilize Rollups-as-a-Service\n\nWeb3 projects can leverage RaaS in a variety of ways to increase transaction\nprocessing speed, reduce network congestion, and thereby, increase the overall\nefficiency of their blockchains, applications, and services.\n\n### Application to Layer-1 and Layer-2 Networks\n\nMany Layer-1 blockchain networks, including Ethereum, are actively exploring\nRollup solutions to improve scalability. Ethereum web3 projects can utilize\nRollups-as-a-service stack to seamlessly launch their custom Rollups-based\napplications without the heavy lifting of infrastructure management and\ngetting the components such as nodes, wallets, explorers, etc. If not Rollups,\nthese projects have to migrate to any Layer-2 network to improve speed and\nperformance, which requires cost, time, effort, and advanced tooling &\ninfrastructure. Similarly to Layer-1, Layer-2 blockchains can use RaaS to\nbuild and implement use case-specific Rollups and operate it as Layer-3 chain\nto process and validate transactions off-chain and send them to L2 mainnet.\n\n### Alternative to Application-specific blockchains\n\nAs we know, AppChains or Application-Specific Blockchains are standalone\nblockchains that manage large dApps on their ecosystem instead of sharing\ninfrastructure with multiple dApps. While AppChains are a great way to achieve\nscalability, they may not be viable for every web3 project due to cost,\ninfrastructure management, etc. Such dApps can instead launch Rollups for\ntheir network\u2019s ecosystem using Rollups-as-a-service platforms with access to\nhigh-end developer tools, plugins, and ready-to-use frameworks. However, web3\nprojects should do a detailed analysis of whether they need Rollups or an\nAppChain ecosystem. The comparison can be done on various parameters such as\nTPS, decentralization, interoperability requirements, customization, and cost-\neffectiveness. ** _ _**  \n\n### Rollups implementation for existing web3 projects\n\nLarge Gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) projects that manage millions of\nactive users may face scalability issues due to increasing network congestion\nand huge transaction processing. These projects can launch Rollups-based\ncustom chains and migrate from their existing infrastructure, achieving high\ntransaction speed, congestion-free environment, and highly secure\ninfrastructure. Again, launching Rollups-based chains becomes easy for NFT and\ngaming web3 projects with Rollups-as-a-service platforms with ready-to-use\nstack, tools, and Rollups SDKs.\n\n## How Zeeve can help you launch your Rollup Chain?\n\nWith Zeeve\u2019s Rollups-as-a-service platform, enterprises, web3 projects, and\nindependent developers can launch the application-specific Rollup rapidly and\nat a fraction of cost.
