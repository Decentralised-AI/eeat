Because these networks add data to the blockchain\nin blocks of a fixed, maximum size, they can only process a limited number of\ntransactions per second. For decentralized applications and Web3 games that\ndemand low latencies and frequent interactions, these limitations can be\ncrippling.\n\nRollups have emerged as one of the most promising solutions to this problem.\nThey record transactions off-chain and only commit them to the blockchain in\nbulk, ensuring many more can be processed at the same time. In this way,\nRollups improve the scalability of blockchains.\n\n## What Are Rollups?\n\nRollups address the blockchain\u2019s scalability problem by offloading\ntransactions onto a second, higher network layer rather than processing them\nall on the main chain. Rollups are Layer-2 protocols that sit on top of an\nexisting network such as Ethereum, recording summaries of transactions as\nthey\u2019re performed. Rollups then take batches of transactions and record them\nonto the main blockchain with minimal on-chain data, in order to record the\nstatus updates that result from those transactions, without overwhelming the\nnetwork.\n\nRollups come in two main flavors. First, there are Optimistic Rollips, which\nassume transactions are legitimate until proven otherwise. They operate with a\n\u201cchallenge period\u201d during which anyone is able to submit that a rollup\ntransaction is invalid. If no challenges are submitted during this period, the\nnetwork will then assume the transactions are valid and process them on the\nmain blockchain.\n\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that users are unable to withdraw their\nfunds immediately, and must wait until the challenge period has expired.\n\nAdvertisement  \n\nTo overcome this limitation, ZK Rollups use a cryptographic technique called\nzero-knowledge proofs in order to demonstrate that its state updates are\nvalid. ZK-proofs, as they\u2019re known, make it possible to prove a transaction is\nvalid without revealing the full details about that transaction. These proofs\nmean it\u2019s possible to validate an entire batch of transactions without\naccessing the complete transaction data on-chain. Due to this, there\u2019s no need\nfor a challenge period, meaning users can withdraw their funds immediately.\n\nThere are a number of dedicated Rollup platforms available for developers to\naccess, including Starknet and zkSync. Developers can build on these L2\nplatforms to record their transactions off-chain, enabling their dApps to\nscale with ease.\n\n## ZK Rollup Frameworks\n\nThere are limitations to building on an existing ZK Rollup platform. For\ninstance, the developer has no say in things such as the transaction\nstructure, and the rate at which they\u2019re verified on-chain, and these factors\nmay not fit with the specific needs of their dApp. Additionally, existing ZK\nRollapp platforms still face limits on the number of transactions they can\nprocess, even if these limits are far higher than the underlying L1.\n\nTo get around this, developers can build their own ZK Rollup L2 using\nframeworks such as Arbitrum Orbit, Rollkit, and OP Stack, which provide all\nthe tools needed to do this. Because ZK Rollups are implemented using open-\nsource smart contracts, they can be modified to create a custom ZK Rollup that\nbest meets the needs of their application.\n\nOn the downside, these Rollup frameworks are not easy to use. Developers must\nhave deep technical knowledge of the smart contract programming language in\norder to modify the smart contracts that govern their Rollups.\n\nA second problem with ZK-Rollups is that they require diverse hardware\nresources, including ZK-proof computational power, data storage and packaging\nnodes. The costs of maintaining these hardware resources can quickly add up,\nmeaning ZK Rollups are an inappropriate solution for scaling many kinds of\ndApps.\n\n## ZK Rollups-as-a-Service\n\nThe complexity of building customized ZK Rollup layers is unfortunate because\nthey have shown themselves to be one of the best solutions for blockchain\nscaling in terms of speed and security. Luckily, the industry has responded to\nthis with a fresh concept known as ZK Rollups-as-a-Service, or ZK-RaaS, which\nhandles many of the complexities involved in creating and customizing a ZK\nRollup L2. Using ZK-RaaS platforms, developers are free to focus on\ncustomizing essential features such as payment fees, data availability and\ntransaction fees, without worrying about the complexity of doing this\nthemselves.\n\nOne of the most notable pioneers of ZK-RaaS is Lumoz, which recently rebranded\nfrom Opside. It has created a hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake network that\nfacilitates ZK-proof mining and enables developers to quickly generate a\ncustomized zkEVM L2 chain in just a few clicks.\n\nOne of the advantages of Lumoz is that its network handles all of the\nprocessing requirements, incentivizing a huge community of miners to provide\nthe computational power necessary to run its zkEVMs. The main objective of\nLumoz is to encourage the wider adoption of ZK Rollups by making them as\nsimple as possible to deploy. It enables developers to create and deploy a\nzkEVM across multiple chains.\n\n## ZK-RaaS Advantages\n\nZK-RaaS makes it possible for any dApp to operate its own Rollup network to\naddress scalability challenges. With their own ZK Rollup, dApps can process\nmany more transactions than would be possible on the L1 network or even on a\nshared ZK Rollup layer, where they are forced to compete with other dApps.\n\nThis means that dApp developers can offer their users almost instantaneous\ntransaction processing times. With ZK-RaaS, developers have full control of\nparameters such as the frequency at which batches of transactions are written\nto the blockchain and confirmed.\n\nAnother benefit is that developers are free to create their own fee\nstructures, balancing this against the frequency at which transactions are\nprocessed. The more transactions that are bundled together as one, the cheaper\nthe transaction costs will be. This provides a lot of flexibility to dApps\nthat may not need immediate transaction processing, enabling them to entice\nusers with lower costs.\n\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of all is that dApps can continue to take\nadvantage of Ethereum\u2019s strong security. While many dApp developers are\nbuilding atop alternative, more scalable blockchain networks, those L1s cannot\nmatch Ethereum\u2019s level of security. By using a ZK-RaaS on Ethereum, dApps can\nbe built atop the most secure smart contract blockchain in existence. And it\ngoes without saying that developers don\u2019t require specialist skills to do any\nof this, as they instead rely on third-party expertise.\n\n## ZK Rollups Are Ready For Prime Time\n\nZK Rollups are one of the most promising scalability solutions around for\nblockchain networks, but the concept has not yet been widely adopted due to\nthe complexity of creating them. With ZK-RaaS now reaching maturity, it has\nnever been easier to implement ZK Rollups. Developers can build a fully\ncustomized scaling solution in a matter of minutes, and they can do so at a\nlow cost as there\u2019s no need to concern themselves with hardware maintenance.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n         \n\n  \n\n  \n\n      Ads by Cointraffic    \n\n\n\nPrevious articleFanton Fantasy Football Announces significant initial\ninvestment from TONcoin.Fund\n\nNext articleMulti-chain Trading Platform zkLink Announces Integrated Support\nfor Bitget Wallet\n\nLivine Sanchez\n\nLivine Sanchez is an Avid Crypto Lover and Passionate writer.
