The goal is to create a network of interconnected blockchains\nusing zero-knowledge proofs that exist as Layer 2s alongside, or Layer 3s\nrunning on top of, the zkSync Era chain.\n\nAnkr clients can now use its RaaS to create dedicated blockchains to serve\nspecific use cases, though functionality to deploy the Hyperchains is\ncurrently confined to a testnet environment.\n\n## 'Distinctive scalability'\n\n######  THE SCOOP\n\n##  Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi\nwith a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro\n\nBy signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nEMAIL\n\nAlso receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are\nFREE\n\nBy signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Hyperchains from ZK Stack have the potential to become one of the most\npowerful rollup options available for developers,\" Ankr Senior Product Manager\nKev Silk said. \"The distinctive scalability and security features, in addition\nto the seamless customization and deployment from Ankr\u2019s Rollup as a Service,\nwill make Hyperchains an important evolution for the Layer 2 space as a\nwhole.\"\n\n\"Ankr's Rollup-as-a-Service will reduce development time for projects and\nenterprises looking to deploy Hyperchains and allow teams to focus on their\nunique use cases enabled through ZK Stack while simultaneously speeding up\ntime to market,\" Matter Labs SVP of Business and Operations Marco Cora added.  \n\nIn October, hybrid crypto exchange GRVT said it would launch the first\nHyperchain in the zkSync ecosystem.\n\n  \n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news,\nresearch, and data.
