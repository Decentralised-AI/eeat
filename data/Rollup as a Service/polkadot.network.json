Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with\na wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network.\n\nEconomic & transactional scalability\n\nPolkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set\nof validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional\nscalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.\n\nEasy blockchain innovation\n\nCreate a custom blockchain in minutes using the Substrate\u2197 framework. Connect\nyour chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one.\nThis ease of development helps Polkadot\u2019s network grow.\n\nHigh energy efficiency\n\nPolkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional\nblockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS)\nmodel. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year,\nPolkadot has the lowest carbon footprint\u2197 among proof-of-stake protocols\nanalyzed in  recent research\u2197.\n\nSecurity for everyone\n\nPolkadot's novel data availability and validity scheme allows chains to\ninteract with each other in a meaningful way. Chains remain independent in\ntheir governance, but united in their security.\n\nUser-driven governance\n\nPolkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a\nvoice. Network upgrades are coordinated on-chain and enacted autonomously and\nwithout forking the network, ensuring that Polkadot\u2019s development remains\nfuture-proof and community-driven.\n\n## Learn more about Polkadot\u2019s technology\n\nDiscover Polkadot\n\n## Powering the Polkadot network\n\nThe DOT token serves three distinct purposes:  \ngovernance over the network, staking and bonding.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All\nprivileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners will be given to\nthe Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional\nevents such as protocol upgrades and fixes.\n\nStaking\n\nToken holders keep the network secure and collect rewards by staking DOT.\nPolkadot\u2019s advanced staking system is designed for maximum decentralization\nand fair representation, rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors to\nensure network security.\n\nBonding\n\nNew parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains\nare removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.\n\n### Learn more about DOT and staking\n\nDiscover DOTLearn staking\n\n### An open-source protocol built for everyone\n\nPolkadot is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation\u2197.\n\nWeb3 Foundation has commissioned five teams and over 100 developers to build\nPolkadot, including:\n\nChainSafe\n\nParity Technologies\n\nPolkadot JS\n\nSoramitsu\n\n### Founded by some of the blockchain industry\u2019s foremost builders\n\nLearn more\n\n## From the blog\n\nPolkadot Blockchain Academy\n\nPolkadot Blockchain Academy: Targeted Education for Builders and Founders\n\nPolkadot Blockchain Academy, which celebrates its second birthday later this\nyear, is already meeting the needs of two distinct Web3 groups.\n\nEcosystem\n\nPolkadot Showcases Industry-Leading Scalability in Positive End to 2023\n\nPolkadot\u2019s final quarter of 2023 featured sustained organic growth, with\npronounced spikes in transactional data in late December.\n\nBlockchain\n\nPolkadot 2023 Roundup\n\nPolkadot founder Gavin Wood reflects on the key events within the ecosystem\nduring 2023, and provides a vision of how 2024 might pan out.\n\n### Want to get involved?\n\nJoin the community\n\nor learn about how to build on Polkadot.\n\nEcosystem\n\n  * Community\n  * Jobs\n  * Wallets\n  * Dapps\n  * Brand Hub\n  * Telemetry\u2197\n  * Treasury\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Technology\n  * DOT token\n  * Parachains\n  * System parachains\n  * Staking\n  * XCM\n  * Auctions\n  * OpenGov\n  * Blockspace\n\nDevelopment\n\n  * Documentation\n  * Grants\u2197\n  * Bounties\u2197\n  * Blockchain Academy\n  * Build\n  * Substrate\u2197\n  * Developer Heroes Program\n\nAbout\n\n  * About Polkadot\n  * Blog\n  * Newsroom\n  * Roadmap\n  * Whitepaper\n  * Wiki\u2197\n  * FAQ\n  * Support\u2197\n  * Contact\n\nNewsletter\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter to hear about Polkadot updates and events.\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * \u00a9 2024Web3 Foundation\u2197\n  * Legal Disclosures\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy\n  * Manage Cookies\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n",
