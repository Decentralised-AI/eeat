It\nis decentralized and operates independently of a central bank.  \nUnlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a physical\ncommodity or government, and their value is determined by market demand and\nsupply. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, transfer\nfunds, and trade in markets. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin,\nEthereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Cronos.  \nMany cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are created through a process called\nmining, which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate and\nrecord transactions on a blockchain. This mechanism is also called Proof of\nWork (PoW). Another consensus mechanism that has increased in popularity \u2014 as\nit is more energy efficient \u2014 is Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of mining, PoS\nrelies on network participants validating transactions. Ethereum, the second-\nlargest cryptocurrency, uses this consensus mechanism.\n\n### What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. It\nwas created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi\nNakamoto. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, and it has\ngained significant popularity and value since its creation.  \nUnlike traditional fiat currency, which is controlled by central banks and\ngovernments, Bitcoin operates independently of any central authority.\nTransactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain, which is a\ndistributed ledger that maintains a permanent and transparent record of all\ntransactions.  \nBitcoin can be bought, sold, and exchanged on various cryptocurrency\nexchanges, and it can be used to purchase goods and services from merchants\nthat accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. The supply of bitcoins is limited to\n21 million units, and new bitcoins are created through mining, which involves\nusing specialized computer hardware to solve complex mathematical equations.  \nBitcoin is known for its high volatility, and its value can fluctuate rapidly\nin response to market conditions, news events, and other factors. Many\ntraders, including institutional investors, see Bitcoin as a store of value\nand a way to participate in the growing cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n### Where to buy crypto?\n\nThere are several ways to buy cryptocurrencies, including:  \n\n  1. Brokerage services: Crypto brokers allow users to simply buy and sell cryptocurrencies. A popular example is the Crypto.com App, trusted by over 80 million users.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces: These are platforms where buyers and sellers can directly trade cryptocurrencies without the involvement of a third-party exchange. This is also known as DeFi, short for decentralized finance. Multiple P2P crypto marketplaces can be accessed all in one app via the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet.\n\nIt is important to perform proper research and choose a reputable platform to\nbuy cryptocurrencies.
