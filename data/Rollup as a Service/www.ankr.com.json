This is the question\nthat Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers are seeking to answer. Layer-2s are\nbecoming increasingly important for scaling Web3 to handle any amount of\ntraffic. RaaS makes it easier than ever to launch a layer 2 rollup to provide\ndedicated infrastructure for a dApp so developers can focus on creating better\nexperiences for the end user without worrying about network congestion or gas\nfees.\n\n## What Are Rollup-as-a-Service Providers?\n\nRaaS providers are companies that offer a platform for developers to deploy\nand manage their own custom rollups. This produces a dedicated blockchain for\ntheir dApp or project to run on, meaning they don\u2019t have to compete for\ntraffic from the hundreds or thousands of other dApps running on public\nblockchains like Ethereum or Polygon. RaaS platforms typically provide a\nvariety of features and services to make it easier for developers to launch\nand manage their rollups, such as:\n\n  * **Rollup infrastructure:** RaaS providers launch and operate the underlying node infrastructure needed to run a rollup, such as full nodes, validators, sequencers, and aggregators.\n  * **Development tools:** RaaS providers often provide development tools and frameworks to help developers build their rollups, such as SDKs and other tools.\n  * **Security and auditing:** RaaS providers can help developers secure their rollups and have them audited by third-party security firms.\n  * **Engineering services:** Some providers may provide complete engineering and deployment of the rollup for a hands-free and easy experience.\n  * **Ongoing support:** RaaS providers can provide ongoing support to developers, such as troubleshooting, performance optimization, and continued node operations.\n\nRaaS platforms can help lower the barrier to entry for developers who want to\nlaunch their own rollups. By providing the necessary infrastructure and tools,\nRaaS platforms can make it easier for developers to focus more on building\ntheir applications and less on the technical challenges of running a rollup.\n\n**Some examples of blockchain Rollup-as-a-Service providers include:**\n\n  * Caldera\n  * Conduit\n  * AltLayer\n\nRaaS platforms are a relatively new development in the blockchain space, but\nthey have the potential to play a major role in the future of scaling. By\nmaking it easier for developers to launch their own rollups, RaaS platforms\ncan help to bring the benefits of rollups to a wider range of applications and\nusers.\n\n## What Are Sidechain-as-a-Service Providers?\n\nSidechains, or AppChains as they are sometimes called, are a different type of\nblockchain scaling solution architecture. One of the key differences between\nsidechains and layer-2 chains is that sidechains have their own security model\nand validator infrastructure, while layer-2 chains inherit the security and\ndecentralization of the layer-1 blockchain. This means that sidechains are\nmore independent and flexible, but lack some of the benefits inherited from\nL1s like Ethereum.\n\nSidechain-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers are companies that offer a platform\nfor developers to deploy and manage their own sidechains. Examples of SaaS\nproviders include:\n\n  * Ankr\n  * Kaliedo\n  * Horizen Labs\n\n## Zero-Knowledge vs. Optimistic Rollups: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nZero-knowledge (ZK) rollups and optimistic rollups are two types of layer-2\nscaling solutions that are designed to improve the throughput and scalability\nof Ethereum. Both types of rollups work by bundling transactions together and\nprocessing them off-chain, but they differ in how they verify the validity of\ntransactions.\n\nZero-knowledge rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to verify the validity of\ntransactions without revealing any underlying data. Since the data relayed in\nthese proofs is much smaller and more efficient than including all of the\ntransaction info, it makes for a faster and more affordable means of\nverification.\n\n**Examples of ZK Rollups:**\n\n  * zkSync\n  * StarkNet\n  * Polygon zkEVM\n\nOptimistic rollups assume that all transactions are valid until proven\notherwise, hence the \u201coptimism.\u201d This allows optimistic rollups to process\ntransactions very quickly and cheaply, but it also introduces a risk of fraud.\nIf a fraudulent transaction is submitted to an optimistic rollup, anyone can\nsubmit a fraud-proof to challenge it.\n\n**Examples of Optimistic Rollups:**\n\n  * Optimism\n  * Arbitrum\n  * Boba\n\n## Why Should Developers Launch Their Own Rollup?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Web3 developers should consider launching\ntheir own Layer 2 (L2) rollup:\n\n  * **Improve scalability and performance:** Rollups can significantly improve the scalability and speed of decentralized applications, enabling developers to onboard nearly any number of users \u2013 something very important for large enterprises entering the space.\n  * **Reduce transaction fees and improve efficiency:** Rollups can process more transactions at a lower cost by bundling them for processing off-chain. This means your users will have a much better experience with low or even zero gas fees.\n  * **Tailor the rollup to the specific needs of the application:** Developers can tailor their rollup to the specific needs of their application. This can include things like supporting custom smart contracts, transaction types, and security features.\n  * **Capture value:** Developers who launch their own rollup can capture value from the network by charging fees for transactions and data storage, launching their own on-chain assets, and other opportunities that otherwise go to public chains like Ethereum.\n  * **Build a community:** Launching a rollup can help developers to build a community around their project. This can lead to more users, developers, and investors supporting the project.\n\n## Join the Conversation on Ankr\u2019s Channels\n\nTwitter | Telegram Announcements | Telegram English Chat | Help Desk | Discord\n| YouTube | LinkedIn | Instagram | Ankr Staking\n\nReturn to blog\n\nFind on\n\n  * Products\n\n    * Web3 API\n\n    * Staking\n\n    * Scaling Services\n\n    * Automate\n\n    * Enterprise Solutions\n\n    * Block Explorer\n\n    * Ankr Network\n\n    * Ankr Token\n\n  * RPCs\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * See All\n\n  * Staking\n\n    * Ethereum\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * Avalanche\n\n    * Binance Smart Chain\n\n    * Polkadot\n\n    * Fantom\n\n    * See All\n\n  * Case Studies\n\n    * BNB Chain\n\n    * Chiliz\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * SushiSwap\n\n    * Meta Apes\n\n    * Mantle Network\n\n    * See all case studies\n\n  * Resources\n\n    * Docs\n\n    * Tutorials\n\n    * Github\n\n    * Ankr Whitepaper 2.0\n\n    * Brand Assets\n\n  * Company\n\n    * About Us\n\n    * Blog\n\n    * Press\n\n    * Careers\n\n  * Socials\n\n    * Twitter\n\n    * Telegram\n\n    * Discord\n\n    * Medium\n\n    * Reddit\n\n    * Instagram\n\n    * YouTube\n\n    * LinkedIn\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ankr All rights reserved     info@ankr.com\n\n  * Terms of service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n",

Big Savings On High Performance RPC Services\n\nKevin Dwyer\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\n4 min read\n\nWhen it comes to choosing how to connect their projects with blockchain data,\nmost developers want the option that provides the highest performance possible\n\u2013 but for projects with a limited budget, it helps if that service comes with\nan affordable price tag. Ankr provides all services with our community of\ndevelopers in mind first and foremost. This is why we\u2019ve positioned our core\nRPC service to be **the highest quality and most affordable option available\nto Web3 builders.**\n\n## Predictable Pay-As-You-Go Pricing Ensures You Never Overpay\n\nMost RPC/API service providers have a pricing system based on daily request\nlimits with a monthly subscription plan. Often, the price of each RPC request\ncall is estimated differently in how much processing power it consumes in\n\u201ccompute units,\u201d making it difficult to anticipate how quickly your monthly\ncompute unit allotment will run out. If it does run out, you will most likely\nneed to pay overages which can be quite costly (in addition to your\nsubscription). This all leads to a customer experience that makes it more\nconfusing for builders in knowing what their monthly costs will be as they\nfrequently pay for more than they use.\n\n**However, Ankr\u2019s Premium RPC plans are much more predictable, powerful, and\naffordable.**\n\n  * Pricing per request method is the same for all EVM-compatible chains\n  * Pay-As-You-Go per RPC request ensures no overpayment from a subscription\n  * Option to pay in crypto for any service tier\n  * 1,500+ requests per second regardless of compute units (upgradeable on request)\n  * No limit to how many of your apps use the service\n  * Option to sign in with a Google account or Ethereum Wallet and pay with a credit card\n\n**Visit ourpricing page for more info.**\n\n## Pay Less for Flexible Plans That Scale With You\n\nAnkr has created our pricing system to be as stable and cost-effective as\npossible for our users. The price of Ankr\u2019s API Credits is always pegged to\nUSD. And when using ANKR tokens for Pay-As-You-Go plans, ANKR automatically\ncalculates API Credits at the latest ANKR/USD exchange rate. However, many\nusers like the simplicity of credit card payments, and you can see prices in\nUSD clearly in the chart below.\n\nIn either payment method (ANKR or USD), it is much easier to anticipate what\nyour daily, weekly, and monthly costs will be. That\u2019s because request type\nprices are greatly simplified, and users will be able to gauge their usage\ncosts easily once they know their average daily requests per EVN/ non-EVM\nchains. **And the best part is, if your usage is down, your costs will fall as\nwell. You won\u2019t have a set monthly cost or additional fees waiting for you.**\nAnd no worries, if you run out of credits \u2013 your account wouldn\u2019t be\nsuspended, it will just convert to the free plan, and your Premium benefits\nwill be reactivated immediately after the payment.\n\nOur PAYG pricing model:\n\n0.10 USD = 1M API Credits\n\n**Learn more about our pricing in theAnkr Docs.**\n\n## Affordable, Developer-First Pricing Saves You Money\n\nAnkr provides developer-first pricing for Premium RPC services at competitive\nrates across all supported chains (more than any other provider). More than\nthat, we are transitioning to a model that shares all RPC revenue with\nindependent node providers, creating a more collaborative and decentralized\nway to serve blockchain traffic.\n\nThe graph above shows a price comparison of how much it would have cost\nSpiritSwap to make 8,590,000,000 requests using each provider (a real monthly\nfigure for their usage of Ankr\u2019s RPCs). We used SpiritSwap as an example\nbecause their large scale of multichain traffic makes it especially important\nfor them to save on infrastructure. You can see that Ankr charges drastically\nlower rates than our main competitors.\n\n_Estimated price comparison from May 2022_\n\n## Easier Payment Methods Save You Time and Effort\n\nAnkr is a Web3-native organization, but many of our users will love the\nsimplicity that comes with logging on via their Google account. New users can\nsign up and log in with Google authentication as an easy way to get started\nand top up their account balances with a credit card. Additionally, those who\ncreate an account with a wallet like MetaMask now use credit cards as a\npayment method.\n\n  * Create an account easily with Google\n  * Pay using your credit card (accepting the most common global credit and debit cards)\n  * Access all the ease of use and security features of Google\n\n**Create a new account in two clicks with Google.**\n\n## Never Sacrifice Performance for Affordability\n\nAnkr isn\u2019t just leading the pack in pricing. Our RPC services have\nconsistently outperformed the competition in every area developers care about:\n\n  * Latency\n  * Reliability\n  * Supported Blockchains\n  * Global Distribution\n  * User Experience\n  * Decentralization\n\n**We\u2019ve broken all of it down here \u2013 seewhere Ankr stands in performance.**\n\n## Join the Conversation on Ankr\u2019s Channels\n\nTwitter | Telegram Announcements | Telegram English Chat | Help Desk | Discord\n| YouTube | LinkedIn | Instagram | Ankr Staking\n\nReturn to blog\n\nFind on\n\n  * Products\n\n    * Web3 API\n\n    * Staking\n\n    * Scaling Services\n\n    * Automate\n\n    * Enterprise Solutions\n\n    * Block Explorer\n\n    * Ankr Network\n\n    * Ankr Token\n\n  * RPCs\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * See All\n\n  * Staking\n\n    * Ethereum\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * Avalanche\n\n    * Binance Smart Chain\n\n    * Polkadot\n\n    * Fantom\n\n    * See All\n\n  * Case Studies\n\n    * BNB Chain\n\n    * Chiliz\n\n    * Polygon\n\n    * SushiSwap\n\n    * Meta Apes\n\n    * Mantle Network\n\n    * See all case studies\n\n  * Resources\n\n    * Docs\n\n    * Tutorials\n\n    * Github\n\n    * Ankr Whitepaper 2.0\n\n    * Brand Assets\n\n  * Company\n\n    * About Us\n\n    * Blog\n\n    * Press\n\n    * Careers\n\n  * Socials\n\n    * Twitter\n\n    * Telegram\n\n    * Discord\n\n    * Medium\n\n    * Reddit\n\n    * Instagram\n\n    * YouTube\n\n    * LinkedIn\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ankr All rights reserved     info@ankr.com\n\n  * Terms of service\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n"
