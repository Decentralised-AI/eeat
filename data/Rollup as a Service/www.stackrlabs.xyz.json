Implement deterministic state machines\nfor logic in any programming language like Python or Javascript.\n\n# Build sufficiently decentralized apps\n\nInstead of putting the entire application on-chain, many developers are opting\nto decentralize just the bits that matter most (e.g. Farcaster).\n\n## Usecases\n\nThe capacity of rollups to validate any offchain computation represents a\nremarkable superpower that can be harnessed to create highly effective and\nefficient use cases for distributed computing.\n\n### Games\n\nConstruct fully immersive interactive games in languages you love.\n\n### Off-chain multi-nodal networks\n\nDevelop comprehensive distributed applications. Provide novel on-chain\nservices to users by enabling nodes to interact with each other through a\nrollup network.\n\n### Decentralized Databases\n\nCreate a fully-fledged decentralized database system.\n\n### Permissioned enterprise applications\n\nBuild powerful private and semi-private applications with robust data access\ncontrols.\n\n### Oracles and real world data\n\nThis design also enables the efficient and seamless integration of off-chain\ndata sources such as social graphs, user credit scores, and KYC and identity\nsystems.\n\n### DeFi and NFT applications\n\nBridge assets from mainnet and run an offchain orderbook matching engine to\nfacilitate trades for users.\n\n### No limits\u2026\n\nWe are just unlocking the potential of rollups for distributed computing\napplications. Build secure and reliable communication infrastructure with\ncustom L2s.\n\n# News\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\n## Announcing Stackr and Introducing Micro-rollups\n\nRead more\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\n## Value accrual for Rollup frameworks and RaaS\n\nRead more\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\n## Announcing Stackr's $5.5M Seed Fundraise\n\nRead more\n\nSitemap\n\n  * Home\n  * Blog\n  * Community\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Mirror\n\nWebsite by Designatives\n\n",
