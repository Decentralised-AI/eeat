With the\nlaunch of Rollup-SDKs, one-click rollup solutions, and Rollup Sequencer-as-a-\nService (RSaaS) solutions, RaaS is becoming increasingly popular, and more\nsolutions are likely to be introduced.\n\nThe modular blockchain thesis proposes that a blockchain can be separated into\nthree distinct components: _settlement_ , _data availability_ , and\n_execution_ {{It's job\n\n# Sign-up to Nansen to get unrivalled crypto coverage\n\nSign up\n\nAlready have an account?
