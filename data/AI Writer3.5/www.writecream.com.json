We\nbelieve the best way to make our emails stand out from the hundred\u2019s cold\nemails that our target recipient receives is through personalized first liners\nthat connect with the reader\u2019s mind\n\nThis is easier said than done because cold emailing requires special attention\nto detail. You have to learn about their business and come up with an opener\nthat would make it seem authentic rather than using a general template \u2014\nsomething that can be time-consuming and difficult without the help of a\ncopywriter.\n\nThat's why, when we saw Writecream on Appsumo, we immediately decided to use\nthe WriteCream AI copywriter tool to help us with our process.\n\nImagine being able to generate ice breaking emails that are custom-made for\nthe recipient just by supplying a website URL or LinkedIn profile.\n\nThat way, we were able to spend more time focusing on leads and moving closer\nto closing deals.\n\nBrilliant! And that\u2019s just one feature.\n\nEvery feature from personalized introductions for LinkedIn outreach, to Blog\nHeading Expander (which turns a single line into a full paragraph) has been\npolished to perfection with WriteCream\n\nCheers to the WriteCream team, and please, guys, don't stop. You are literally\non your way to redefine the future of the AI copywriting market!\n\n**H\u00fcppe Keith** Founder, TimeKeeper\n\n__________\n\n**Blown away! It really is the cream of the crop for AI writing tools.**\n\nI have a few different AI writing tools, but when I tried Writecream for the\nfirst time I was just blown away.\n\nWritecream really pushes the limits of what AI writing can do. For example,\npersonalized introductions by just giving the AI a website URL to work with. I\nread through 4 or 5 introductions that were better than what I could have\nwritten myself. I knew at this point I was a customer for life.\n\nThe AI out put will save your company so much time and money. You will look\nlike a big shot marketing guru by using this tool to write for you.\n\nCustomer support is also very responsive. I had a few conversations through\ntheir live chat to ask some questions about my account and get clarity.\n\n5 Stars because: AI output is the best out of all the AI tools I have tried\nand because customer support has live chat to talk to an agent when you\nencounter any problems.\n\n**Hugo Sanguino** ERP Developer\n\n__________\n\n**Spanish? Buy now!**\n\nIt only took me 3 minutes to decide to buy it. I have tried almost every\nsingle GPT-3/AI on the LTD market, no kidding! but this is the only one that\ngave me the correct output for my products and brand in Spanish language.\nAlso, UI is simple and clean, including the long form editor (beta)' that is\nimportant to me, the founder (Krittin) has been very active in the FB groups\nwith a nice attitude and very responsive, that is good sign!. It was a\nsurprise how fast Writecream is. I hope it stays as fast as it is now!\n\n**Frank Didszuleit** Founder, Didszuleit\n\n__________\n\n**Writecream is MY Game Changer!**\n\nWritecream is a game-changer for me. Writecream1 creates high converting copy\nfor me, allowing me to focus on the important tasks that require your time and\nattention.\n\nWritecream is a huge time saver for people like me, who need to generate\ncontent for multiple platforms, and at the same time, cannot spend all day\ndoing that. Writecream is able to generate unique and engaging content based\non my ideas. I love how it can even generate customized content based on my\ncustomers and projects!\n\nThe best thing about Writecream is that there is no work on my end. The tool\ndoes all the magic for me - creating blog posts, making Facebook ad copies,\nwriting landing pages, product descriptions, and even writing my next angel\nfunding email. Really - it's like magic!\n\n**Gennady Batrakov** Founder, Blogely\n\n__________\n\n**Amazing app -**\n\nExactly what I was looking for - personalization with AI. I tested on LinkedIn\nand it came out perfect. It would take me an hour to do like 15-20\npersonalization. I find this staff difficult... Surprisingly, when I do it\nmyself, my brain quickly loses its cool.\n\nI wanted to hire someone to do just that all day long. However, I doubt that a\nhired person would achieve this level of success.\n\nLove it. So, thank you for saving me a time and money.\n\nNo question - big 5 tacos.\n\nI hope the company will specialize just on that, and they will do very well.\n\n**Calle** Business Owner\n\n__________\n\n**A content marketers secret weapon!**\n\nThis tool is perfect for people who are looking for a way to automate their\nmarketing. I love that I can automate my emails. This has helped me reach out\nto leads and prospects more efficiently. I'm able to create personalized\nemails for my leads and prospects and keep them interested in my messaging.\nDesigning emails is an important part of marketing, and I love that I can do\nit all through this tool.\n\n\u25d8 That was written VIA the product review generator!\n\nAs you can see, it's simply amazing at what it does. I'm looking forward to\nthe content rewrite tool, but as it stands it's truly fantastic and makes\ngetting a website off the ground and reviews (which I do many of) a piece of\ncake, it's as easy as... a click of a button!\n\n**Nicholas Scalice** Founder, Earnworthy\n\n__________\n\n**A solid tool that does what it says**\n\nThis is a no-brainer 5 Taco deal. While AI-powered tools are all the rage\nright now, finding one that can especially help with specific use cases like\ncold email outreach and intros is rare. I didn't think it would work as well\nas it did, but so far, the intros and personalization text I've generated with\nit has been spot on. Better than what I could have come up with and so much\nless hassle.\n\n**Ankit S J B Rana** Marketing Director, Filma\n\n__________\n\n**A different type of AI Copywriting Tool**\n\nWritecream is unique and different from other AI writing tools out there.\n\n1) The results are better, more relevant, and is on topic\n\n2) Its got a unique set of tools for emails and outreach\n\n3) It is pretty fast and again, the output is super relevant\n\nThe following is a real example to create a meta description for a blog post -\n\nInput:\n\nTopic - Setup and Configure WordPress Website\n\nDescription -\n\nAfter years of working in WordPress and improving countless websites, I made a\npersonal list of things I check every time.\n\nThis blog is the list of over 23 essential things that I set up and configure\nto get the most out of a WordPress website.\n\nBest Output-\n\nWordPress is a great platform for building a website, but it can be a\nchallenge to get the most from your website. This blog includes 23 essential\nthings that you should configure to get the most from your website.\n\nI'd say the results are pretty good and am going to be testing it out quite a\nbit\n\n**Sebestian Ong** Global SMM Specialist, Swiss Post Solutions\n\n__________\n\n**Great tool for content creators**\n\nWritecream is particularly useful in providing a structure for your blog if\nlongform content is one of your challenges.

It\nsearches over 150 million companies, 250, 000 news sites, a billion social\nprofiles, and more, to provide you with the resources needed to scale your\nbusiness. Seamless AI, as the name suggests is an AI-powered tool that lets\nyou search for leads that are relevant as well as help you organize them.\n\nSeamless AI is a relative newcomer to the B2B market, but it has been able to\nsuccessfully attract a number of businesses owing to its reasonable price.\nAlong with the pricing, another aspect of the tool that has worked wonders for\nthe brand is the various options it provides when it comes to searching,\nsorting, and saving contacts. Saearching profiles whether it be companies or\nindividuals couldn\u2019t get more advanced as Seamless AI comes with the options\nto filter your search according to the industry, size of the company,\nlocation, and title of the person. Of course, similar to other tools in the\nmarket, revealing a contact requires credits which are initially provided for\nfree. The stand-out feature here would be the research option which allows you\nto gather additional information about your prospects.\n\n\n\nNaturally, once you are done with your research and prospecting, you would\nprefer to save the contacts that you believe are a good fit for your\nrequirements. Seamless AI does a good job of making this part of your\nprospecting as simple as possible with the option to sort your contacts into\ndifferent lists and also export them outside the tool. Exporting contacts can\nbe done in two different approaches \u2013 you can export raw data, which is done\nin an excel type document with all the details that you might want to use in\nthe future. The other option is to export clean data which is essentially the\ninformation you are most likely going to use i.e. contact details and links.\n\n\n\n### **Features:**\n\n  * **_Find Contact Social_** : Seamless AI is an excellent tool when it comes down to finding leads on social media. You don\u2019t need to have a Premium LinkedIn account to make use of this feature as it can be utilized in the free version of LinkedIn as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n  * **_Lists_ :** As mentioned earlier, Seamless AI lets you organize your contacts by adding them to a created list. There is absolutely no limit to the number of lists that you can create and it even comes with the option to filter your lists. Categorizing your contacts is an indispensable part of keeping your lead prospecting organized and structured. Another cool feature is that the created lists are also downloadable and can be exported to other tools.\n\n\n\n  * **_Finding companies_** : If you are looking to land companies as clients instead of individuals, Seamless AI helps you achieve this by letting you find the right people within the business to contact. Searching companies according to the number of employees, estimated revenue, location, and keywords is also a great feature that adds to the value of this tool.\n\n\n\n  * **_Lead Enrichment_** : This feature utilizes Artificial intelligence to research more into specific contacts and adds new relevant information that it collects from the internet to its database. This is a step ahead of other tools as most B2B Software rely solely on updating pre-existing data which doesn\u2019t really add much value since effective prospecting requires more than just contact details.\n\n\n\n  * **_Chrome Browser Extension_** : Seamless AI offers this unique feature that allows it to be run as an extension. This is beneficial especially when it comes to finding leads on LinkedIn as it can gather information much more effectively. Not having to run separate windows is probably a big advantage as many other tools do not provide this feature.\n\n\n\n  * **_Tracking goals_** : The tool lets you set your sales targets and with the help of details about your commission targets it calculates the worth of every sale. With a few simple calculations, it helps you determine the number of leads you need to contact in a period of time to meet your sales goals.\n\n\n\n  * **_Lead Analysis_** : The stand-out feature of Seamless AI is its ability to select leads based on the company\u2019s and the user\u2019s profile. Through various factors like lead scoring and market interactions, and analyzing patterns, the AI selects relevant data and presents it to the user. This spares the user from long hours of finding leads manually and makes the most of its sophisticated AI model.\n\n\n\nIf you take a deeper look into the above features, it is quite evident that\nSeamless AI is loaded with features that are sometimes not available in other\ntools even if they cost more. This alone could be a reason why Seamless AI\nmight be the right tool for you. If you are new to the world of sales, this\ntool will essentially play the role of guiding and assisting you through the\nconfusing maze of prospecting leads.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Generate personalized emails, blog articles, product descriptions, and ads\nin seconds using the power of A.I\n\n\n\n### **Pricing**\n\nSeamless AI has three different plans according to the user\u2019s requirements.\nAlthough it does come with a free trial, it offers limited features and unless\nyou upgrade your plan, you won\u2019t be able to make the most of its amazing\nfeatures.\n\n  1. **_Basic plan_** : Starting at $147 / Mo, you get 250 credits per month along with a host of other features that include CRM Integrations, Technographics, and Direct Dials among others. For this plan, customer support via email and knowledge base is also available but it is limited to a single user, unlike the pro and enterprise plans.\n  2. **_Pro plan_** : At a discounted price of $99, the pro plan gives 1000 credits per day/user and it can be accessed by 5 users at a time. It comes with a Salesflix Sales Library and Advanced Org Management along with chat support to resolve your queries. This segment is the most popular among current users and features like autopilot and saved searches are to be added soon as per the company website.\n  3. **_Enterprise_** : This plan is for users who want a custom plan as per their requirements. The usual features available in the pro plan are included in this plan as well and a dedicated account manager is also available for support.\n\nThe basic features that are included in all the plans include a search engine\nfor researching contacts available in the database. Collecting phone numbers,\nand email IDs and integrating them into other CRMs is also a common feature.\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, Seamless AI is a great option if you want a new and more\nsophisticated approach to generating leads online. The host of features that\nit comes with makes life simpler for a prospector and I believe it is a great\noption if you wish to move to another tool or more so if you are new to the\nworld of sales prospecting. It costs nothing to take a free trial and if you\ndo find it worth your investment, you can always go for the basic or the pro\nplan. I would suggest if you are new to sales, Seamless AI is the perfect tool\nto kickstart you career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Join Writecream for FREE!\n\nIn just a few clicks and under 30 seconds, generate cold emails, blog\narticles, LinkedIn messages, YouTube videos, and more.\n\nStart Writing For Free  \n\nIt's free, forever!\n\n## Leave A Comment\n\nCancel reply\n\nComment\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\u0394\n\n### Related Posts\n\nThe Best SaaS Deals For Black Friday & Cyber Monday 2023!\n\nGallery\n\n#### The Best SaaS Deals For Black Friday & Cyber Monday 2023!\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nAI4Chat: Unleashing the Potential of AI-Powered Communication\n\nGallery\n\n#### AI4Chat: Unleashing the Potential of AI-Powered Communication\n\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nB2B Link Building Strategies\n\nGallery\n\n#### B2B Link Building Strategies\n\nAugust 16, 2023|0 Comments\n\n __\n\n __\n\n**Contents**\n\nFeatures:\n\nPricing\n\nConclusion\n\nJoin Writecream for FREE!\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nRelated Posts\n\nThe Best SaaS Deals For Black Friday & Cyber Monday 2023!\n\nAI4Chat: Unleashing the Potential of AI-Powered Communication\n\nB2B Link Building Strategies\n\nToggle Navigation\n\n  * Login\n  * Terms\n    * ToS\n    * Privacy\n    * Refunds\n  * Earn \ud83d\udcb0\n    * Affiliate Program\n    * Influencer Program (Recommended)\n  * Roadmap\n    * Submit a Feature Request\n    * Planned Features\n    * Share Feedback\n  * Tutorials\n\n __24\u00d77 Support\n\nGet Started\n\n## Create content in minutes, not weeks.\n\nGet Started \u2013 FREE!\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 Writecream | All Rights Reserved\n\nGet Started For Free\n\nPage load link\n\nGo to Top\n\n\u00d7\n\n### Wait!
