All of your payment information is handled by Stripe, a trusted payment processor. We do not store any of your payment information on our servers. When you checkout or manage your plan, you will be redirected to a secure Stripe-hosted page which means we couldn't access any of your sensitive payment information even if we wanted to.\n\nDo you offer refunds?\n\n    Yes. If you aren't satisfied just contact us and we can provide a refund. However, if there is substantial usage of the service we reserve the right to deny the refund request.\n\nIs it easy to cancel my plan?\n\n    Yes. You can cancel your plan at any time by clicking on the 'Open Customer Portal' button on the 'Account' page when you are logged in.\n\nIs there a free trial available?\n\n    Yes. Just start using our services and you will see how much available usage you have left. Currently the free trial is limited to 5,000 words and 25 chat messages.\n\nDoes unused usage carry over to the next month?\n\n    No. Unused words, chat messages, API credits, or Google Sheets credits will not carry over to the next month. However, you can upgrade your plan at any time to increase your monthly usage limits.\n\nDo I own the output generated by KoalaChat and KoalaWriter?\n\n    Yes. You retain all rights to the input you provide to our services and we assign you all rights to the AI-generated output. You can read more about this in our Terms of Service.\n\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\n\n    Currently we accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, and China UnionPay card payments worldwide. We also accept Apple Pay, Google Pay, US bank transfers, and Canadian bank transfers. We are not able to accept PayPal at this time.\n\nHow do I change my plan?\n\n    You can change your plan at any time from this page by buying a new plan. When you buy a new plan it will reset your subscription date and automatically cancel your old subscription. Your leftover credits will rollover. Upgrades are not prorated since you receive the full amount of credits when buying the new plan.\n\nHow many API calls and Google Sheet formulas are allowed?\n\n    On all plans, Google Sheets Integration and API Access is counted towards the KoalaChat limit. So for example, on the Professional plan you can use a total of 1,000 KoalaChat messages, API calls, and Google Sheets formulas combined.\n\nContact\n\nSupport\n\nAffiliates\n\nBlack FridayNew!\n\nBlog\n\nAPI\n\nStatus\n\nFree Tools\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Koala AI.
