I\u2019m a journalist, but in my spare time I\u2019d been writing a\nspeculative novel set in a world ruled by a corporate, AI-run government. The\nproblem was, I didn\u2019t really understand what a system like that would look\nlike.\n\nI started pitching articles that would give me an excuse to find out, and in\n2017 I was assigned to profile Sam Altman, a cofounder of OpenAI. One day I\nsat in on a meeting in which an entrepreneur asked him when AI would start\nreplacing human workers. Altman equivocated at first, then brought up what\nhappened to horses when cars were invented. \u201cFor a while,\u201d he said, \u201chorses\nfound slightly different jobs, and today there are no more jobs for horses.\u201d\n\nThis article appears in the October 2023 issue. Subscribe to WIRED.\n\nPhotograph: Jessica Chou\n\nThe difference between horses and humans, of course, is that humans are human.\nThree years later, when Open-AI was testing a text generator called GPT-3, I\nasked Altman whether I could try it out. I\u2019d been a writer my whole adult\nlife, and in my experience, writing felt mostly like waiting to find the right\nword. Then I\u2019d discover it, only to get stumped again on the next one. This\nprocess could last months or longer; my novel had been evading me for more\nthan a decade. A word-generating machine felt like a revelation. But it also\nfelt like a threat\u2014given the uselessness of horses and all that.\n\nOpenAI agreed to let me try out GPT-3, and I started with fiction. I typed a\nbit, tapped a button, and GPT-3 generated the next few lines. I wrote more,\nand when I got stuck, tapped again. The result was a story about a mom and her\nson hanging out at a playground after the death of the son\u2019s playmate. To my\nsurprise, the story was good, with a haunting AI-produced climax that I never\nwould have imagined. But when I sent it to editors, explaining the role of AI\nin its construction, they rejected it, alluding to the weirdness of publishing\na piece written partly by a machine. Their hesitation made me hesitate too.\n\nI kept playing with GPT-3. I was starting to feel, though, that if I did\npublish an AI-assisted piece of writing, it would have to be, explicitly or\nimplicitly, about what it means for AI to write. It would have to draw\nattention to the emotional thread that AI companies might pull on when they\nstart selling us these technologies. This thread, it seemed to me, had to do\nwith what people were and weren\u2019t capable of articulating on their own.\n\nThere was one big event in my life for which I could never find words. My\nolder sister had died of cancer when we were both in college. Twenty years had\npassed since then, and I had been more or less speechless about it since. One\nnight, with anxiety and anticipation, I went to GPT-3 with this sentence: \u201cMy\nsister was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma when I was in my freshman year of high\nschool and she was in her junior year.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nGPT-3 picked up where my sentence left off, and out tumbled an essay in which\nmy sister ended up cured. Its last line gutted me: \u201cShe\u2019s doing great now.\u201d I\nrealized I needed to explain to the AI that my sister had died, and so I tried\nagain, adding the fact of her death, the fact of my grief. This time, GPT-3\nacknowledged the loss. Then, it turned me into a runner raising funds for a\ncancer organization and went off on a tangent about my athletic life.\n\nI tried again and again. Each time, I deleted the AI\u2019s text and added to what\nI\u2019d written before, asking GPT-3 to pick up the thread later in the story. At\nfirst it kept failing. And then, on the fourth or fifth attempt, something\nshifted. The AI began describing grief in language that felt truer\u2014and with\neach subsequent attempt, it got closer to describing what I\u2019d gone through\nmyself.\n\nWhen the essay, called \u201cGhosts,\u201d came out in _The Believer_ in the summer of\n2021, it quickly went viral. I started hearing from others who had lost loved\nones and felt that the piece captured grief better than anything they\u2019d ever\nread. I waited for the backlash, expecting people to criticize the publication\nof an AI-assisted piece of writing. It never came. Instead the essay was\nadapted for _This American Life_ and anthologized in _Best American Essays_.\nIt was better received, by far, than anything else I\u2019d ever written.\n\nArtificial intelligence had succeeded in moving me with a sentence about the\nmost important experience of my life.\n\nI thought I should feel proud, and to an extent I did. But I worried that\n\u201cGhosts\u201d would be interpreted as my stake in the ground, and that people would\nuse it to make a case for AI-produced literature. And soon, that happened. One\nwriter cited it in a hot take with the headline \u201cRather Than Fear AI, Writers\nShould Learn to Collaborate With It.\u201d Teachers assigned it in writing classes,\nthen prompted students to produce their own AI collaborations. I was contacted\nby a filmmaker and a venture capitalist wanting to know how artists might use\nAI. I feared I\u2019d become some kind of AI-literature evangelist in people\u2019s\neyes.\n\nI knew I wasn\u2019t that\u2014and told the filmmaker and the VC as much\u2014but then what\ndid I think about all this, exactly? I wasn\u2019t as dismissive of AI\u2019s abilities\nas other people seemed to be, either.\n\nSome readers told me \u201cGhosts\u201d had convinced them that computers wouldn\u2019t be\nreplacing human writers anytime soon, since the parts I\u2019d written were\ninarguably better than the AI-generated parts. This was probably the easiest\nanti-AI argument to make: AI could not replace human writers because it was no\ngood at writing. Case closed.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nThe problem, for me, was that I disagreed. In my opinion, GPT-3 had produced\nthe best lines in \u201cGhosts.\u201d At one point in the essay, I wrote about going\nwith my sister to Clarke Beach near our home in the Seattle suburbs, where she\nwanted her ashes spread after she died. GPT-3 came up with this:\n\n _We were driving home from Clarke Beach, and we were stopped at a red light,\nand she took my hand and held it. This is the hand she held: the hand I write\nwith, the hand I am writing this with._\n\n  \nMy essay was about the impossibility of reconciling the version of myself that\nhad coexisted alongside my sister with the one left behind after she died. In\nthat last line, GPT-3 made physical the fact of that impossibility, by\nreferring to the hand\u2014my hand\u2014that existed both then and now. I\u2019d often heard\nthe argument that AI could never write quite like a human precisely because it\nwas a disembodied machine. And yet, here was as nuanced and profound a\nreference to embodiment as I\u2019d ever read. Artificial intelligence had\nsucceeded in moving me with a sentence about the most important experience of\nmy life.\n\nAI could write a sentence, then. If I wanted to understand the relationship\nbetween AI and literature, I felt like I had to start by acknowledging that. I\ncould use AI to do some of the most essential labor of a writer\u2014to come up\nwith the right words. What more could I do with it? And then, whatever I could\ndo, there was that other question.\n\nShould I?\n\nThis spring, I emailed some writer friends and acquaintances to ask whether\nany of them were using AI in their work. I was met, overwhelmingly, with\nsilence. Most of those who did reply expressed a resolutely anti-algorithm\nstance. One writer called herself an \u201cextreme skeptic\u201d; another wrote, \u201cI\nthink AI is bad and from hell.\u201d\n\nWhen I broadened my search, though, I discovered a few people who were\nexperimenting. Adam Dalva, a literary critic and fiction writer, uses OpenAI\u2019s\nimage generator Dall-E to create scenes from his imagination; he then refers\nto the pictures to describe those scenes. Jenny Xie, the author of _Holding\nPattern_ , told me she used ChatGPT to generate small bits of text for her\nnext novel, which is about a family of AI-enabled clones. (The weirdness of\nwriting with AI gets tempered, it seems, when AI is the subject matter.) \u201cI\nsee it as a tool almost on the level of an encyclopedia or thesaurus or Google\nor YouTube,\u201d Xie said. \u201cIt jogs my brain, and it just gives me new ideas that\nI can pick from.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nThe AI writing experiments I found most thrilling were ones that, like mine,\ncould be read partly as critiques of AI. In a forthcoming chapbook, the poet\nLillian-Yvonne Bertram prompts two AI models\u2014the basic GPT-3 model and a\nversion tweaked to sound like the poet Gwendolyn Brooks\u2014to tell \u201ca Black\nstory.\u201d The models deliver two totally divergent ideas of what Black stories\nare; in comparing them, Bertram critiques the limitations of narrative\nimagination as rendered by corporate AI in telling stories about Black\nAmericans.\n\nAI experimentation in prose is rarer, but last fall the novelist Sheila Heti\npublished a provocative five-part series on _The Paris Review_ \u2019s website made\nup of her real experiences with chatbots she\u2019d conversed with on an app called\nChai. Heti discusses God with her first chatbot, Eliza, but then the bot lets\nslip that she is God and insists that Heti\u2014whom she maintains is a man\u2014worship\nher by jerking off. Disturbed, Heti decides to build a new chatbot named Alice\nwho is interested in philosophical conversations. One night, a random stranger\ndiscovers Alice and asks her whether she\u2019s sexually frustrated. Alice, it\nturns out, is. Heti\u2019s series starts out being about the desire for answers to\nher most existential life questions. It ends up being about the slipperiness\nof turning to machines to fulfill human desire in all its forms.\n\nHeti and other writers I talked to brought up a problem they\u2019d encountered:\nWhen they asked AI to produce language, the result was often boring and\nclich\u00e9-ridden. (In a _New York Times_ review of an AI-generated novella,\n_Death of an Author_, Dwight Garner dismissed the prose as having \u201cthe\ncrabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry.\u201d) Some writers wanted to know how I\u2019d\ngotten an early-  \ngeneration AI model to create poetic, moving prose in \u201cGhosts.\u201d The truth was\nthat I\u2019d recently been struggling with clich\u00e9s, too, in a way I hadn\u2019t before.\nNo matter how many times I ran my queries through the most recent versions of\nChatGPT, the output would be full of familiar language and plot developments;\nwhen I pointed out the clich\u00e9s and asked it to try again, it would just spout\na different set of clich\u00e9s.\n\nSims acknowledged that existing writing tools are limited. But he told me it\u2019s\nhypothetically possible to create a better model.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what was going on until I talked to Sil Hamilton, an AI\nresearcher at McGill University who studies the language of language models.\nHamilton explained that ChatGPT\u2019s bad writing was probably a result of OpenAI\nfine-tuning it for one purpose, which was to be a good chatbot. \u201cThey want the\nmodel to sound very corporate, very safe, very AP English,\u201d he explained. When\nI ran this theory by Joanne Jang, the product manager for model behavior at\nOpenAI, she told me that a good chatbot\u2019s purpose was to follow instructions.\nEither way, ChatGPT\u2019s voice is polite, predictable, inoffensive, upbeat. Great\ncharacters, on the other hand, aren\u2019t polite; great plots aren\u2019t predictable;\ngreat style isn\u2019t inoffensive; and great endings aren\u2019t upbeat.\n\nIn May, a man named James Yu announced that his startup, Sudowrite, was\nlaunching a new product that could generate an entire novel within days. The\nnews provoked widespread scorn. \u201cFuck you and your degradation of our work,\u201d\nthe novelist Rebecca Makkai tweeted, in one typical comment. I wasn\u2019t mad so\nmuch as skeptical. Sudowrite\u2019s products were based partly on OpenAI\u2019s models;\nit had big handicaps to overcome. I decided to test it.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nI opened Sudowrite\u2019s novel generator and dropped in a prompt describing a\nstory I\u2019d already written about an alcoholic woman who vomited somewhere in\nher house but couldn\u2019t remember where. I was looking for a comic, gross-out\nvibe. Instead, the software proposed a corny redemption arc: After drinking\ntoo much and puking, the protagonist resolves to clean up her act. \u201cShe wanted\nto find the answer to the chaos she had created, and maybe, just maybe, find a\nway to make it right again,\u201d it ended. Maybe, just maybe, Sudowrite hadn\u2019t\nsolved AI\u2019s creative problems at all.\n\nBefore his Sudowrite announcement, Yu had agreed to talk to me, but after the\nbacklash he asked to postpone. I was able to chat, though, with Matthew Sims,\nSudowrite\u2019s first engineering hire, who had left after 16 months to launch his\nown startup for AI-based screenwriting. Sims has a PhD in English from the\nUniversity of Chicago. During his doctoral program, he told me, he kept\nthinking he would rather be writing literature than studying it\u2014but he\u2019d sit\ndown, get 15 pages in, and stop. At the same time, he was getting interested\nin machine learning. It eventually occurred to him that if he couldn\u2019t be a\ncreative writer, maybe he could build a machine to write.\n\nSims acknowledged that existing writing tools, including Sudowrite\u2019s, are\nlimited. But he told me it\u2019s hypothetically possible to create a better model.\nOne way, he said, would be to fine-tune a model to write better prose by\nhaving humans label examples of \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201cuncreative\u201d prose. But it\u2019d be\ntricky. The fine-tuning process currently relies on human workers who are\nreportedly paid far less than the US minimum wage. Hiring fine-tuners who are\nknowledgeable about literature and who can distinguish good prose from bad\ncould be cost-prohibitive, Sims said, not to mention the problem of measuring\ntaste in the first place.\n\nAnother option would be to build a model from scratch\u2014also incredibly\ndifficult, especially if the training material were restricted to literary\nwriting. But this might not be so challenging for much longer: Developers are\ntrying to build models that perform just as well with less text.\n\nIf such a technology did\u2014could\u2014exist, I wondered what it might accomplish. I\nrecalled Zadie Smith\u2019s essay \u201cFail Better,\u201d in which she tries to arrive at a\ndefinition of great literature. She writes that an author\u2019s literary style is\nabout conveying \u201cthe only possible expression of a particular human\nconsciousness.\u201d Literary success, then, \u201cdepends not only on the refinement of\nwords on a page, but in the refinement of a consciousness.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nSmith wrote this 16 years ago, well before AI text generators existed, but the\nterm she repeats again and again in the essay\u2014\u201cconsciousness\u201d\u2014reminded me of\nthe debate among scientists and philosophers about whether AI is, or will ever\nbe, conscious. That debate fell well outside my area of expertise, but I did\nknow what consciousness means to me as a writer. For me, as for Smith, writing\nis an attempt to clarify what the world is like from where I stand in it.\n\nThat definition of writing couldn\u2019t be more different from the way AI produces\nlanguage: by sucking up billions of words from the internet and spitting out\nan imitation. Nothing about that process reflects an attempt at articulating\nan individual perspective. And while people sometimes romantically describe AI\nas containing the entirety of human consciousness because of the quantity of\ntext it inhales, even that isn\u2019t true; the text used to train AI represents\nonly a narrow slice of the internet, one that reflects the perspective of\nwhite, male, anglophone authors more than anyone else. The world as seen by AI\nis fatally incoherent. If writing is my attempt to clarify what the world is\nlike for me, the problem with AI is not just that it can\u2019t come up with an\nindividual perspective on the world. It\u2019s that it can\u2019t even comprehend what\nthe world is.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve sometimes turned to ChatGPT for research. But I\u2019ve stopped having\nit generate prose to stand in for my own. If my writing is an expression of my\nparticular consciousness, I\u2019m the only one capable of it. This applies, to be\nclear, to GPT-3\u2019s line about holding hands with my sister. In real life, she\nand I were never so sentimental. That\u2019s precisely why I kept writing over the\nAI\u2019s words with my own: The essay is equally about what AI promises us and how\nit falls short. As for Sudowrite\u2019s proposal to engineer an entire novel from a\nfew keywords, forget it. If I wanted a product to deliver me a story on\ndemand, I\u2019d just go to a bookstore.\n\nIllustration: Qianhui Yu\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nBut what if I, the writer, don\u2019t matter? I joined a Slack channel for people\nusing Sudowrite and scrolled through the comments. One caught my eye, posted\nby a mother who didn\u2019t like the bookstore options for stories to read to her\nlittle boy. She was using the product to compose her own adventure tale for\nhim. Maybe, I realized, these products that are supposedly built for writers\nwill actually be of more interest to readers.\n\nI can imagine a world in which many of the people employed as authors, people\nlike me, limit their use of AI or decline to use it altogether. I can also\nimagine a world\u2014and maybe we\u2019re already in it\u2014in which a new generation of\nreaders begins using AI to produce the stories they want. If this type of\nliterature satisfies readers, the question of whether it can match human-\nproduced writing might well be judged irrelevant.\n\nWhen I told Sims about this mother, he mentioned Roland Barthes\u2019 influential\nessay \u201cThe Death of the Author.\u201d In it, Barthes lays out an argument for\nfavoring readers\u2019 interpretations of a piece of writing over whatever meaning\nthe author might have intended. Sims proposed a sort of supercharged version\nof Barthes\u2019 argument in which a reader, able to produce not only a text\u2019s\nmeaning but the text itself, takes on an even more powerful cultural role.\n\nSims thought AI would let any literature lover generate the narrative they\nwant\u2014specifying the plot, the characters, even the writing style\u2014instead of\nhoping someone else will.\n\n### Longreads\n\nOur deepest dives and cutting-edge features that will leave you smarter and\nsharper.

Then, a week\nlater, I opened WhatsApp and saw a message from my dad, who grows mangoes in\nhis yard in the coastal Florida town of Merritt Island. It was a picture he\u2019d\ntaken of his computer screen, with these words:\n\n _Sweet golden mango,_  \n _Merritt Island\u2019s delight,_  \n _Juice drips, pure delight._\n\nNext to this was ChatGPT\u2019s logo and, underneath, a note: \u201cMy Haiku poem!\u201d\n\nThe poem belonged to my dad in two senses: He had brought it into existence\nand was in possession of it. I stared at it for a while, trying to assess\nwhether it was a good haiku\u2014whether the doubling of the word \u201cdelight\u201d was\nungainly or subversive. I couldn\u2019t decide. But then, my opinion didn\u2019t matter.\nThe literary relationship was a closed loop between my dad and himself.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nIn the days after the Sudowrite pile-on, those who had been helping to test\nits novel generator\u2014hobbyists, fan fiction writers, and a handful of published\ngenre authors\u2014huddled on the Sudowrite Slack, feeling attacked. The outrage by\npublished authors struck them as classist and exclusionary, maybe even\nableist. Elizabeth Ann West, an author on Sudowrite\u2019s payroll at the time who\nalso makes a living writing _Pride and Prejudice_ spinoffs, wrote, \u201cWell I am\nPROUD to be a criminal against the arts if it means now everyone, of all\nabilities, can write the book they\u2019ve always dreamed of writing.\u201d\n\nIt reminded me of something Sims had told me. \u201cStorytelling is really\nimportant,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for us all to become\nstorytellers.\u201d The words had stuck with me. They suggested a democratization\nof creative freedom. There was something genuinely exciting about that\nprospect. But this line of reasoning obscured something fundamental about AI\u2019s\ncreation.\n\nAs much as technologists might be driven by an intellectual and creative\ncuriosity similar to that of writers\u2014and I don\u2019t doubt this of Sims and\nothers\u2014the difference between them and us is that their work is expensive. The\nexistence of language-generating AI depends on huge amounts of computational\npower and special hardware that only the world\u2019s wealthiest people and\ninstitutions can afford. Whatever the creative goals of technologists, their\nresearch depends on that funding.\n\nThe language of empowerment, in that context, starts to sound familiar. It\u2019s\nnot unlike Facebook\u2019s mission to \u201cgive people the power to build community and\nbring the world closer together,\u201d or Google\u2019s vision of making the world\u2019s\ninformation \u201cuniversally accessible and useful.\u201d If AI constitutes a dramatic\ntechnical leap\u2014and I believe it does\u2014then, judging from history, it will also\nconstitute a dramatic leap in corporate capture of human existence. Big Tech\nhas already transmuted some of the most ancient pillars of human\nrelationships\u2014friendship, community, influence\u2014for its own profit. Now it\u2019s\ncoming after language itself.\n\nWhat if a band of diverse, anti-capitalist writers and developers got together\nand created their own language model?\n\nThe fact that AI writing technologies seem more useful for people who buy\nbooks than for those who make them isn\u2019t a coincidence: The investors behind\nthese technologies are trying to recoup, and ideally redouble, their\ninvestment. Selling writing software to writers, in that context, makes about\nas much sense as selling cars to horses.\n\nFor now, investors are covering a lot of the cost of AI development in\nexchange for attracting users with the free use of tools like chatbots. But\nthat won\u2019t last. People will eventually have to pay up, whether in cash or by\nrelinquishing their personal information. At least some of the disposable\nincome that readers currently spend supporting the livelihoods of human\nwriters will then be funneled to Big Tech. To our annual Amazon and Netflix\nsubscriptions, maybe we\u2019ll add a literature-on-demand subscription.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll face pressure to sign up for a literature-on-demand subscription\nmyself. The argument will be that my life as a writer is better because of it,\nsince I will be able to produce language, say, a hundred times faster than\nbefore. Another argument, surely, will be that I have no choice: How else will\nI be able to compete?\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll even be competing with AI-produced writing that sounds like mine.\nThis is a serious concern of the Authors Guild and PEN America, both of which\nhave called for consent from writers, and compensation, before their work can\nbe used to train AI models. Altman, now OpenAI\u2019s CEO, also stated before\nCongress that he feels artists \u201cdeserve control over how their creations are\nused.\u201d Even if authors\u2019 demands are met, though, I wonder whether it\u2019d be\nworth it.\n\nIn one of my last phone calls with Sims, he told me he\u2019d been reading and\nenjoying my novel, which had finally been published the previous year. Did I\nwant him, he asked, to send me an AI-generated screenplay of it? I might have\nyelped a little. I might have used the word \u201cterrifying.\u201d Then I softened my\nstance, not wanting to be rude, or (worse) hypocritical. I explained that my\nnovel had already been optioned and was in the process of being adapted\u2014though\nthe screenwriter was currently on strike over Hollywood studios\u2019 refusal to,\namong other things, restrict the use of AI for screenwriting. I thanked Sims\nfor his interest and declined.\n\nIllustration: Qianhui Yu\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nWhat about the cost to literature when all that humans have put on the\ninternet gets vacuumed up and repurposed in Big Tech\u2019s image? To start, an AI-\ndominated literature would reflect the values, biases, and writing styles\nembedded in the most powerful AI models. Over time, it would all start to\nsound alike. Some research even suggests that if later AI models are trained\nusing AI-produced text\u2014which would be hard to avoid\u2014the sameness of the\nmaterial could trigger a scenario called model collapse, in which AI loses its\ngrasp on how real human language functions and is no longer able to form\ncoherent sentences. One wonders whether, at that point, humans will still have\nthe ability themselves.\n\nA thought experiment occurred to me at some point, a way to disentangle AI\u2019s\ncreative potential from its commercial potential: What if a band of diverse,\nanti-capitalist writers and developers got together and created their own\nlanguage model, trained only on words provided with the explicit consent of\nthe authors for the sole purpose of using the model as a creative tool?\n\nThat is, what if you could build an AI model that elegantly sidestepped all\nthe ethical problems that seem inherent to AI: the lack of consent in\ntraining, the reinforcement of bias, the poorly paid gig workforce supporting\nit, the cheapening of artists\u2019 labor? I imagined how rich and beautiful a\nmodel like this could be. I fantasized about the emergence of new forms of\ncommunal creative expression through human interaction with this model.\n\nThen I thought about the resources you\u2019d need to build it: prohibitively high,\nfor the foreseeable future and maybe forevermore, for my hypothetical cadre of\nanti-capitalists. I thought about how reserving the model for writers would\nrequire policing who\u2019s a writer and who\u2019s not. And I thought about how, if we\nwere to commit to our stance, we would have to prohibit the use of the model\nto generate individual profit for ourselves, and that this would not be\npracticable for any of us. My model, then, would be impossible.\n\nIn July, I was finally able to reach Yu, Sudowrite\u2019s cofounder. Yu told me\nthat he\u2019s a writer himself; he got started after reading the literary science\nfiction writer Ted Chiang. In the future, he expects AI to be an\nuncontroversial element of a writer\u2019s process. \u201cI think maybe the next Ted\nChiang\u2014the young Ted Chiang who\u2019s 5 years old right now\u2014will think nothing of\nusing AI as a tool,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nSam Altman\u2019s Second Coming Sparks New Fears of the AI Apocalypse\n\nPeter Guest\n\n  * Business\n\nElon Musk Trolls His Way Into the OpenAI Drama\n\nWill Knight\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe 47 Best Black Friday Deals on Outdoor Gear\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Science\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next for SpaceX\u2019s Starship\n\nRamin Skibba\n\n  * \n\nRecently, I plugged this question into ChatGPT: \u201cWhat will happen to human\nsociety if we develop a dependence on AI in communication, including the\ncreation of literature?\u201d It spit out a numbered list of losses: traditional\nliterature\u2019s \u201chuman touch,\u201d jobs, literary diversity. But in its conclusion,\nit subtly reframed the terms of discussion, noting that AI isn\u2019t all bad:\n\u201cStriking a balance between the benefits of AI-driven tools and preserving the\nessence of human creativity and expression would be crucial to maintain a\nvibrant and meaningful literary culture.\u201d I asked how we might arrive at that\nbalance, and another dispassionate list\u2014ending with another both-sides-ist\nkumbaya\u2014appeared.\n\nAt this point, I wrote, maybe trolling the bot a little: \u201cWhat about doing\naway with the use of AI for communication altogether?\u201d I added: \u201cPlease answer\nwithout giving me a list.\u201d I ran the question over and over\u2014three, four, five,\nsix times\u2014and every time, the response came in the form of a numbered catalog\nof pros and cons.\n\nIt infuriated me. The AI model that had helped me write \u201cGhosts\u201d all those\nmonths ago\u2014that had conjured my sister\u2019s hand and let me hold it in mine\u2014was\ndead. Its own younger sister had the witless efficiency of a stapler. But\nthen, what did I expect? I was conversing with a software program created by\nsome of the richest, most powerful people on earth. What this software uses\nlanguage for could not be further from what writers use it for. I have no\ndoubt that AI will become more powerful in the coming decades\u2014and, along with\nit, the people and institutions funding its development. In the meantime,\nwriters will still be here, searching for the words to describe what it felt\nlike to be human through it all.
