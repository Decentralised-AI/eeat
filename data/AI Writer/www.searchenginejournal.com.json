Can you tell which is the AI writer?\n\nSEJ STAFF Shelley Walsh\n\n  * May 10, 2022\n  * \u22c5\n  * 13 min read\n\nSEJ STAFF Shelley Walsh ShelleyWalsh.com\n\nBio\n\nFollow\n\n  *   *   * \n\n  * 367\n\nSHARES\n\n  * 134K\n\nREADS\n\nAI Content creation tools are becoming more widely available since the\ndevelopment of GPT-3 (and its release through Open.ai) has made AI much more\naccessible.\n\nTo see just how good AI writers are, we selected 10 of the best content\ngenerators and road-tested them by comparing their output on the same topic.\n\nWe ran our own mini Turing Test while testing the AI content generators.\n\nWe asked our audience if they could tell the difference between machine and\nhuman-generated content through social media polls.\n\nAre machines taking over the content industry? Read on and find out!\n\n## How GPT-3 Is Shaking Up Content Creation\n\nGPT-3, the language prediction model, was introduced in May 2020 and is widely\navailable for public use through Open AI.\n\nThe quality of GPT-3 output was a huge leap forward from GPT-2 toward asking a\nmachine to write intelligible cohesive content.\n\nThe downside to the development of GPT-3 and vastly improved content creation\ntools: How do you keep pace with the output of a machine?\n\nGoogle has been looking at solving the potential issues of the predicted\nexplosion of AI content to ensure their search results don\u2019t become swamped\nwith low-quality content.\n\nThey recently restated that AI content is against their guidelines and updated\ntheir webmaster guidelines documentation.\n\nHow can they distinguish between a machine and just badly written human\ncontent?\n\nThe progress and development of AI writers and content tools is only just\ngetting started.\n\nPrivate investment in AI more than doubled last year to $93.5 billion in 2021.\n\nThis means that more machine learning tools are being developed that will\nbecome more integrated into the tools we use as marketers and SEO\nprofessionals.\n\nMeta recently announced a new research project into next-generation AI.\n\nThey aim to create an AI that processes data like humans and would be\nindistinguishable from a human.\n\nWhen that might be available is not known.\n\nMachine domination aside, in this article, we will review a selection of the\ncurrent best content creation tools to see how they compare.\n\nAnd consider how they can help us do a more efficient job.\n\nWill AI take over the content creation industry? Let\u2019s look at the results of\nthe tools we tested.\n\n## AI Content Creation Tools Compared\n\nWe fed all the content generator tools we tested were fed the same subject\nmatter to generate a similar length of output.\n\nWith a meta self-referential irony, we used the simple phrase, \u201cAI content\ncreation.\u201d\n\nWe compared the use of the tool and the quality of the content output. You can\nsee that output in each of the screenshots below.\n\nAs part of the comparison, we also ran all the content through Copyscape to\ncheck for plagiarism. Only one content generator was flagged with issues.\n\nThe difference in styles was most surprising about comparing the output from\nall the tools.\n\nWe half expected more similar results when running the same key phrase through\nan AI tool, but clearly, every generator has its own variables for how content\nis written. Much like a variety of human writers.\n\n_Screenshot from Writesonic, May 2022_\n\n## 1\\. Writesonic\n\n  * Free version up to full unlimited price plans.\n  * Paid version reasonably priced.\n  * 24 languages.\n\nWritesonic is built on GPT-3 and claims the machine is trained on the content\nthat the brands using the tool produce.\n\nThe generator is based around facilitating marketing copy, blog articles, and\nproduct descriptions. The generator can also provide content ideas and\noutlines and has a full suite of templates for different types of content.\n\nWe found Writesonic very easy to use and it didn\u2019t take much work to get a\nfull article straight out of the box.\n\nThe free plan is an option to try the basic tool with the choice to upgrade to\nget access to full functionality.\n\n_Screenshot from Frase, May 2022_\n\n## 2\\. Frase\n\n  * Paid only.\n  * Cheap plans, but the credits are expensive.\n\nFrase is a content assistant and targeted to content marketers and SEO\nprofessionals for faster and better productivity.\n\nThe tool is structured around a framework of content brief, content writing,\ncontent optimization, and content analytics.\n\nThe tool excels for research and brief outlines and the talking points tool is\nuseful for structuring an article. A content brief can be prepared in minutes.\n\nFor content writing, the generator doesn\u2019t produce a full article straight out\nof the box, and it needs some work to get the results. But, the quality of\ncontent output is high.\n\nFrase is a useful tool for content marketers that can help to reduce the\namount of time spent on writing with a competent writer in charge.\n\n_Screenshot from Copy.ai, May 2022_\n\n## 3\\. Copy.ai\n\n  * Free plan and paid unlimited.\n  * Paid plans very cheap.\n  * 25 languages.\n\nDesigned to be an antidote to writer\u2019s block, Copy.ai is a cheap and easy-to-\nuse content generator.\n\nCopy.ai provides templates across various content types such as blogs, ads,\nsales, websites, and social media. The generator also provides translation\ninto 25 languages.\n\nAn unusual addition to their range of tools includes a baby name generator,\nbut we didn\u2019t manage to get any usable results for a baby name.\n\nAlthough easy to use, it\u2019s a tool for anyone producing volume content up to an\naverage level but not for high-end content production.\n\nThe free plan is an option to try before you buy.\n\n_Screenshot from AI Writer, May 2022_\n\n## 4\\. AI Writer\n\n  * Free trial and paid plans.\n  * Flagged in plagiarism checks.\n\nAI Writer pitches itself as SEO-friendly, producing fresh and relevant copy\nthat can save you 50% of your writing time.\n\nFrom our test, AI Writer is an easy tool to use, and you get an article\nwritten within minutes.\n\nHowever, it was the only tool we tested that our Copyscape plagiarism check\nflagged.\n\nThe articles from the writer were not the most fluid or cohesive, and felt\nmuch like an article spinner.\n\nOut of all content generators tested, this tool didn\u2019t feel like it was at the\nsame standard of output as the others.\n\n_Screenshot from Hyperwrite, May 2022_\n\n## 5\\. Hyperwrite\n\n  * Free.\n  * Chrome extension.\n\nHyperwrite\u2019s claim is to use the most advanced AI generator. It\u2019s one of the\nmost basic tools to use and generate content and the only tool that is fully\nfree to use.\n\nFrom our test, we found the output to be surprisingly cohesive and fluid.\n\nA useful part of the tool is that it can rewrite a sentence or make paragraphs\nlonger to quickly restructure and build out content where needed.\n\nThe text output from Hyperwrite was the one that most people chose as being\nhuman written in our Turing Test on social media.\n\nIt\u2019s also a free tool that offers some of the better quality of all the tools\ncompared and is the perfect tool to test the ability and constraints of AI\ncontent generation.\n\n_Screenshot from INK, May 2022_\n\n## 6\\. INK\n\n  * Free version and full paid plans.\n  * Chrome extension.\n\nINK is another AI-powered tool targeted at content marketers and SEO experts\nas a content assistant for faster output and optimized content.\n\nINK has 60 templates based around advertising, growth, website, and writing,\nincluding YouTube, pain agitation, catchy subjects, and listicles.\n\nThere\u2019s a focus on SEO and getting content to rank with tools that support\noptimization and a tool scoring system to rate how well your article is\noptimized.\n\nIn the hands of a professional writer, INK can be a useful tool to support\noutput, but it won\u2019t do the job for you.\n\nThe tool took some work to get the final output, which was sometimes\nquestionable.\n\nINK generously offers up to 10 articles free in a month, which provides plenty\nof scope to try before you buy.\n\n_Screenshot from Rytr, May 2022_\n\n## 7\\. Rytr\n\n  * Free plan to unlimited plan.\n  * Cheap price plans.\n  * 30 languages.\n\nRytr is a full AI content generation tool built on GPT-3, emphasizing\ngenerating content that converts.\n\nThe tool has over 30 templates for marketing copy, blogs, and product\ndescriptions. It also incorporates AIDA and PAS formulas to get the best\nresults for copywriting.\n\nThe tool was quick and easy to use and we had a reasonable quality article in\nfive minutes.\n\nRytr has a free plan with access to all the tools with a limit of 5,000\ncharacters a month. The paid plans start very cheap if you want to progress\nand take more advantage of the tool.\n\n_Screenshot from Smart Copy, May 2022_\n\n## 8\\. Snazzy (Now Smart Copy By Unbounce)\n\n  * Free plan to paid unlimited version.\n\nSnazzy is powered by GPT-3 and their own proprietary machine learning to\ncreate a tool focused on landing page generation.\n\nUnbounce acquired Snazzy and rebranded as Smart Copy and is now structured to\ncomplement and support Unbounce for seamless landing page creation.\n\nA full range of tools are available, such as outlines, ad copy, product\ndescriptions, and social media copy. But, the tool is pitched toward\ngenerating sales-led persuasion copy.\n\nThe results generated in our test for \u2018AI content generation\u2019 were somewhat\nunpredictable and not intelligible enough for an article. However, we didn\u2019t\ntest specifically for landing page copy.\n\nSnazzy/Smart Copy offers a free plan with up to five credits a day to try to\nsee if it works for you.\n\n_Screenshot from Long Shot, May 2022_\n\n## 9\\. Long Shot\n\n  * Free version up to unlimited version.\n  * Eight Languages.\n\nLong shot pitches itself as an AI-powered long-form content assistant to\nproduce SEO-friendly content built on a combination of GPT-3 and custom AI\nmodels.\n\nIt includes over 30 tools for keyword research, rephrasing, and fact-checking,\nand you can write in eight languages.\n\nFrom our test, we found Long Shot easy to use to produce reasonable quality\ncontent.\n\nOne interesting point: When comparing all the content output from the range of\ntools we tested, this was the only generator that included any brand names\nsuch as Google\u2019s RankBrain and Buzzsumo.\n\nThis detail made the content output quite believable that it could be human-\nwritten.\n\nLong Shot offers a free plan with up to 10 credits a day.\n\n_Screenshot from Jasper, May 2022_\n\n## 10\\. Jasper\n\n  * Paid plans only.\n  * 25 languages.\n\nJasper (previously Jarvis) claims it will help you write faster, beat writer\u2019s\nblock, and rank better with SEO-optimized content.\n\nThey also claim to have consulted with SEO professionals and direct marketing\nexperts to perfect how the AI generator writes content.\n\nJasper has over 50 templates for producing content, including AIDA, PAS,\nblogs, social media, and marketing.\n\nFrom our experience, Jasper is another writing support tool and not one that\nwrites full articles without input. With guidance, the content generated from\nthe tool is very good.\n\nThe tool is easy to use and the quality was good; however, we found the\ncontent generated was limited to short articles.\n\nJasper doesn\u2019t offer any free plans, but it offers a free trial for five days.\n\nBe aware you have to input your credit card and you will get charged if you\nforget to cancel.\n\nPackages are not cheap, so you would have to max out the five-day trial to see\nif it was worth the investment.\n\n## The Results Of Our AI Content Turing Test\n\nThe test we ran was a simple short poll to gauge opinion and not a\nstatistically significant result of large numbers. But, the results we found\nand the comments were surprising.\n\nWe provided three examples of 100 words of content, all based on \u201cAI content\ncreation\u201d and created from some of the tools above. We wrote the fourth\nsnippet.\n\nWe asked our audience, \u201cCan you tell which one is human-generated?\u201d\n\nThe short result is that no one could distinguish between AI-generated content\nand the human-written paragraph.\n\nThe reasons that people offered to justify those (incorrect) choices were\nquite interesting:\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\nOut of all the comments, only a few guessed that number 4 was the human-\ngenerated copy:\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\n_Image from Twitter, May 2022_\n\nSee the full Twitter thread here.\n\nFrom all responses across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, most people thought\nthat number 1 was the human-written text.\n\nThe second text had the least amount of responses. Not surprising as this was\nnot the best quality snippet of generated content.\n\nThe actual human-generated text was number 4 and came in third place in votes.\n\n## How You Can Use AI In Content Marketing\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of experimentation happening with GPT-3 with plenty of fun tools\nbeing produced. But, look past these novelty applications to see where they\ncan really have an impact.\n\nYes, you can machine generate your Twitter feed, but social media is about\ninteraction and engagement.\n\nYes, you can write an article, but is it good enough to put your name to or\nrepresent your brand?\n\nWhat needs to be considered with AI content generation is that a tool is only\nas good as the person operating it.\n\nThey are excellent for productivity and speeding up content production. But,\nyou need someone who knows their subject and is a good writer behind the wheel\nto get results worthy of using.\n\nA content marketer can take advantage of AI as an efficiency tool to make\nrepetitive tasks easier and output faster.\n\nIn those terms, AI will become more and more seamlessly integrated into\nmarketing.\n\n### Where AI Content Does Work\n\n  * For product descriptions at scale.\n  * For meta descriptions at scale.\n  * Sports results broadcasting.\n  * To support a writer\u2019s productivity.\n\n### Where AI Content Doesn\u2019t Work\n\n  * Producing well-researched content.\n  * Creating data-driven content.\n  * Having innovative and fresh ideas.\n  * Thought leadership.\n\n## Will AI Take Over Content Creation?\n\nAlthough it\u2019s now almost impossible to tell the difference between human and\nmachine-generated content, the level of that content won\u2019t win any journalist\nawards.\n\nA tool cannot make up for a lack of knowledge or ability. It can only enhance\nit.\n\nThe machine generates content output from what is input; therefore, it only\nregurgitates; it isn\u2019t creating new ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s ideal for some tasks, but not for high-level well-researched content or\nthought leadership. And this is where good researchers and writers will become\nmore valuable.\n\nYou can be assured that content creation will go into overdrive with AI.\n\nYou can also be assured that good quality journalist standard content with\nunique data, thought opinions, and insights will become the only way to get\nvisibility and sustain an audience.\n\nWho\u2019s the winner of that game?\n\n**More resources:  **\n\n  * An Up-to-Date Guide on Good SEO Content vs. Bad SEO Content\n  * What\u2019s In Your Toolkit? 30+ Expert-Approved Content Marketing Tools\n  * Perfectly Optimized Content From Start To Finish\n\n* * *\n\n_Featured Image: ProStockStudio/Shutterstock_\n\nCategory Tools Content Creation\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead Full Bio\n\nSEJ STAFF Shelley Walsh  ShelleyWalsh.com\n\nShelley Walsh is the SEO Content Strategist at SEJ & produces the Pioneers, a\nseries about the history of SEO ...\n\n### Subscribe To Our Newsletter.\n\nConquer your day with daily search marketing news.\n\nPlease provide a valid first name.\n\nPlease provide a valid email.\n\nTopic of interests * *****\n\nSEO\n\nThis checkbox is required.\n\nPaid Media\n\nThis checkbox is required.\n\nContent\n\nThis checkbox is required.\n\nSocial\n\nThis checkbox is required.\n\nThis checkbox is required.\n\nI want to receive the latest search news and updates from SEJ.
