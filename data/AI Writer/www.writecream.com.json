We\nbelieve the best way to make our emails stand out from the hundred\u2019s cold\nemails that our target recipient receives is through personalized first liners\nthat connect with the reader\u2019s mind\n\nThis is easier said than done because cold emailing requires special attention\nto detail. You have to learn about their business and come up with an opener\nthat would make it seem authentic rather than using a general template \u2014\nsomething that can be time-consuming and difficult without the help of a\ncopywriter.\n\nThat's why, when we saw Writecream on Appsumo, we immediately decided to use\nthe WriteCream AI copywriter tool to help us with our process.\n\nImagine being able to generate ice breaking emails that are custom-made for\nthe recipient just by supplying a website URL or LinkedIn profile.\n\nThat way, we were able to spend more time focusing on leads and moving closer\nto closing deals.\n\nBrilliant! And that\u2019s just one feature.\n\nEvery feature from personalized introductions for LinkedIn outreach, to Blog\nHeading Expander (which turns a single line into a full paragraph) has been\npolished to perfection with WriteCream\n\nCheers to the WriteCream team, and please, guys, don't stop. You are literally\non your way to redefine the future of the AI copywriting market!\n\n**H\u00fcppe Keith** Founder, TimeKeeper\n\n__________\n\n**Blown away! It really is the cream of the crop for AI writing tools.**\n\nI have a few different AI writing tools, but when I tried Writecream for the\nfirst time I was just blown away.\n\nWritecream really pushes the limits of what AI writing can do. For example,\npersonalized introductions by just giving the AI a website URL to work with. I\nread through 4 or 5 introductions that were better than what I could have\nwritten myself. I knew at this point I was a customer for life.\n\nThe AI out put will save your company so much time and money. You will look\nlike a big shot marketing guru by using this tool to write for you.\n\nCustomer support is also very responsive. I had a few conversations through\ntheir live chat to ask some questions about my account and get clarity.\n\n5 Stars because: AI output is the best out of all the AI tools I have tried\nand because customer support has live chat to talk to an agent when you\nencounter any problems.\n\n**Hugo Sanguino** ERP Developer\n\n__________\n\n**Spanish? Buy now!**\n\nIt only took me 3 minutes to decide to buy it. I have tried almost every\nsingle GPT-3/AI on the LTD market, no kidding! but this is the only one that\ngave me the correct output for my products and brand in Spanish language.\nAlso, UI is simple and clean, including the long form editor (beta)' that is\nimportant to me, the founder (Krittin) has been very active in the FB groups\nwith a nice attitude and very responsive, that is good sign!. It was a\nsurprise how fast Writecream is. I hope it stays as fast as it is now!\n\n**Frank Didszuleit** Founder, Didszuleit\n\n__________\n\n**Writecream is MY Game Changer!**\n\nWritecream is a game-changer for me. Writecream1 creates high converting copy\nfor me, allowing me to focus on the important tasks that require your time and\nattention.\n\nWritecream is a huge time saver for people like me, who need to generate\ncontent for multiple platforms, and at the same time, cannot spend all day\ndoing that. Writecream is able to generate unique and engaging content based\non my ideas. I love how it can even generate customized content based on my\ncustomers and projects!\n\nThe best thing about Writecream is that there is no work on my end. The tool\ndoes all the magic for me - creating blog posts, making Facebook ad copies,\nwriting landing pages, product descriptions, and even writing my next angel\nfunding email. Really - it's like magic!\n\n**Gennady Batrakov** Founder, Blogely\n\n__________\n\n**Amazing app -**\n\nExactly what I was looking for - personalization with AI. I tested on LinkedIn\nand it came out perfect. It would take me an hour to do like 15-20\npersonalization. I find this staff difficult... Surprisingly, when I do it\nmyself, my brain quickly loses its cool.\n\nI wanted to hire someone to do just that all day long. However, I doubt that a\nhired person would achieve this level of success.\n\nLove it. So, thank you for saving me a time and money.\n\nNo question - big 5 tacos.\n\nI hope the company will specialize just on that, and they will do very well.\n\n**Calle** Business Owner\n\n__________\n\n**A content marketers secret weapon!**\n\nThis tool is perfect for people who are looking for a way to automate their\nmarketing. I love that I can automate my emails. This has helped me reach out\nto leads and prospects more efficiently. I'm able to create personalized\nemails for my leads and prospects and keep them interested in my messaging.\nDesigning emails is an important part of marketing, and I love that I can do\nit all through this tool.\n\n\u25d8 That was written VIA the product review generator!\n\nAs you can see, it's simply amazing at what it does. I'm looking forward to\nthe content rewrite tool, but as it stands it's truly fantastic and makes\ngetting a website off the ground and reviews (which I do many of) a piece of\ncake, it's as easy as... a click of a button!\n\n**Nicholas Scalice** Founder, Earnworthy\n\n__________\n\n**A solid tool that does what it says**\n\nThis is a no-brainer 5 Taco deal. While AI-powered tools are all the rage\nright now, finding one that can especially help with specific use cases like\ncold email outreach and intros is rare. I didn't think it would work as well\nas it did, but so far, the intros and personalization text I've generated with\nit has been spot on. Better than what I could have come up with and so much\nless hassle.\n\n**Ankit S J B Rana** Marketing Director, Filma\n\n__________\n\n**A different type of AI Copywriting Tool**\n\nWritecream is unique and different from other AI writing tools out there.\n\n1) The results are better, more relevant, and is on topic\n\n2) Its got a unique set of tools for emails and outreach\n\n3) It is pretty fast and again, the output is super relevant\n\nThe following is a real example to create a meta description for a blog post -\n\nInput:\n\nTopic - Setup and Configure WordPress Website\n\nDescription -\n\nAfter years of working in WordPress and improving countless websites, I made a\npersonal list of things I check every time.\n\nThis blog is the list of over 23 essential things that I set up and configure\nto get the most out of a WordPress website.\n\nBest Output-\n\nWordPress is a great platform for building a website, but it can be a\nchallenge to get the most from your website. This blog includes 23 essential\nthings that you should configure to get the most from your website.\n\nI'd say the results are pretty good and am going to be testing it out quite a\nbit\n\n**Sebestian Ong** Global SMM Specialist, Swiss Post Solutions\n\n__________\n\n**Great tool for content creators**\n\nWritecream is particularly useful in providing a structure for your blog if\nlongform content is one of your challenges.

There\nis zero wait time \u2013 meaning you don\u2019t have to wait for any approvals. To\nenroll in the program, all you have to do is fill out a simple questionnaire,\nregister an account and then submit your payment details. That\u2019s it!\n\nYou can then copy your unique referral link. ETA to complete all these steps\nis 5 minute, tops!\n\nNow that we have an overview of the enrollment process, let\u2019s take a look at\nthe nitty gritty details, like affiliate commission, how much you can earn,\nthe minimum threshold for payments, when do the payouts take place, and more.\n\n## Affiliate Commission\n\nYou will earn a healthy commission of 35% whenever a customer purchases one of\nour monthly plans using your referral link.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Generate personalized emails, blog articles, product descriptions, and ads\nin seconds using the power of A.I\n\nThe commission isn\u2019t one-time. Rather, you will get the same 35% commission\nevery month until the referred customer is subscribed to our monthly plan.\n\nIf you have any confusion here, it will get resolved in the sections below.\nKeep reading!\n\n### How much can I earn?\n\nWritecream offers the following monthly plans:\n\n  * Standard: $49\n  * Extended: $69\n  * Custom: Cost varies as per user requirements\n\nA big chunk of our users opt for custom plans that can cost anywhere from $100\nto $10,000 (custom plan users primarily include those who want to use our cold\nemail and LinkedIn personalization features excessively, among others).\n\nAs mentioned before, you will earn a 35% commission for every referred\ncustomer. Thus, you can earn as follows for every referred user:\n\n  * Standard: $17.15/month or $205.8/year\n  * Extended: $24.15/month or $289.8/year\n  * Custom: $350/month or $4,200/year (assuming the plan cost as $1000)\n\nYou will continue to earn referral commission from the same user for every\nmonth they renew their plan. If we consider our Standard plan, that means you\nwill earn $17.15 for the first month, $17.15 for the second month (if the user\nrenews their subscription for the second month), $17.15 for the third month\n(if the user renews their subscription for the third month), and so on.\n\nIn the case of Writecream, the user doesn\u2019t have to renew their subscription\nmanually for each month. They are charged automatically again after their plan\nexpires.\n\n## What is the minimum threshold for payments?\n\nThe minimum threshold for payments is $15. That means the affiliate income\nwill be credited to your bank account even if just one person signs up using\nyour referral link.\n\n## When do the payouts take place?\n\nAll the payouts are processed by the 7th of every month.\n\n## How do I register for Writecream\u2019s affiliate program?\n\nPlease follow the steps below to enroll in our affiliate program:\n\n### **Step 1.**\n\nStart by opening the following link: https://writecream.typeform.com/affiliate\n\n### **Step 2.**\n\nA form, as shown above, will open up. After clicking on the Start button, you\nhave to answer four simple questions that include your name, email, and the\nplatforms (such as website, social media, etc) where you will promote\nWritecream\n\n### **Step 3.**\n\nAfter you have filled the form, it\u2019s time to submit your payment details and\ngenerate a referral link. You will get a page as shown above. Click on the\n\u2018Submit Payment Details\u2019 button.\n\n### **Step 4.**\n\nYou will be redirected to our affiliate partner, Reditus\u2019 website. The Reditus\ndashboard will help you keep track of the referral statistics (for example,\nnumber of users who signed up using your link), your affiliate income and the\npayouts.\n\nEnsure **\u2018I am an affiliate\u2019** is selected and then fill your particulars to\ncreate an account.\n\n### **Step 5.**\n\nYou will receive an account verification email. Confirm your account using the\nsame and login.\n\n  *   *   * \n\n### **Step 6.**\n\nYou will be greeted by a short onboarding form that asks for your company and\npayment details. The images above mention all the details you will have to\nfill.\n\n### **Step 7.**\n\nOur next stop is the Reditus dashboard. Here you can view all the statistics,\nincluding number of clicks, sign-ups, the referral income, and more. We have\nexplained statistics in detail in the next section.\n\nNow, we will generate a unique referral link. Click on My Partnerships from\nthe left pane.\n\n### **Step 8.**\n\nA new page, as shown above, will open up. Click on the green Accept button.\n\n### **Step 9.**\n\nThe page will refresh automatically. You will get a \u2018Partnership was\nsuccessfully updated\u2019 message and the Status tab will change from Pending to\nAccepted.\n\nTo obtain your referral link, click on the Copy button besides the green\nAccepted status.\n\n## How do I track my referrals?\n\nThe Reditus dashboard has all the statistics you will need, including:\n\n**1\\. Clicks:** Total number of clicks on your referral link  \n **2\\. Unique clicks:** Number of unique clicks (or cookies placed). The\nnumber of clicks in the first point also counts multiple clicks made by the\nsame user  \n **3\\. Referrals:** Number of users who sign up using your link  \n **4\\. Paid Referrals:** Number of users who purchased a monthly plan using\nyour link  \n **5\\. Total Sold:** Total amount sold  \n **6\\. Commission Earned:** Total commission earned from sales  \n **7\\. Expected MRR:** Expected monthly recurring revenue  \n **8\\. Churned referrals:** Number of users who stopped using the product or\ndidn\u2019t renew their subscription\n\nBesides plain numbers, Reditus also visualises referral statistics for a\nspecific period using graphs.\n\nAs soon as a user signs up using your referral link, ths referral statistics\nin Reditus are updated. There is no delay whatsoever.\n\nYou will also get an email (pictured above) and a notification in the Activity\nLog (pictured below) when a referral signs up or purchases a plan using your\nlink.\n\nWe recommend bookmarking Reditus\u2019 sign in link to keep the referral statistics\na click away:  \nhttps://app.getreditus.com/affiliate/sign_in\n\n## I still have questions.
