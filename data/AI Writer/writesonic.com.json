It\noperates on a separate, pay-as-you-go pricing model. This allows you to\npurchase audio generation minutes according to your specific needs, without\nbundling it into a subscription.\n\n  1. $10 for 40 minutes: Ideal for short projects or initial testing.\n  2. $25 for 100 minutes: Suitable for medium-length audio content needs.\n  3. $50 for 200 minutes: A cost-effective choice for larger projects.\n  4. $100 for 400 minutes: Best value for extensive audio generation requirements.\n\nBy offering Audiosonic separately, we give you the flexibility to choose just\nthe services you need, whether that's content creation, image generation, AI\nchatbot development, or audio production.\n\n### Is Botsonic included in the paid plans of Writesonic?\n\nBotsonic was initially part of Writesonic's subscription plans but has since\nbeen transitioned to its own standalone platform. This move was driven by the\nsignificant interest in Botsonic's capabilities, prompting us to redesign and\nrebuild the platform from the ground up.\n\nThe new architecture focuses on exceptional performance, seamless AI\nworkflows, scalability, and reliability, offering a robust and efficient user\nexperience.\n\nBotsonic now has its own pricing model, separate from Writesonic. You can view\nthe pricing details at Botsonic Pricing. Plans for Botsonic start at\n$49/month.\n\n### I have exhausted my words before the start of the next billing month. How\ncan I get more?\n\nIf your words are exhausted during the month, you can upgrade to the next\nhigher plan, and only the pro-rated difference will be charged based on the\nremaining days in the billing cycle. If you need fewer words next month, you\ncan again downgrade your plan and be charged accordingly.\n\n### Is there any pay-as-you-go plan?\n\nNo. Currently, pay-as-you-go plans are available only for Audiosonic.\n\n### If I subscribe to a monthly plan, will I be charged automatically next\nmonth?\n\nYes, monthly subscription plans charge you automatically every month until you\ncancel or pause them.\n\n### What are the payment methods supported by Writesonic? Is it possible to\npay through PayPal as well?\n\nWritesonic currently accepts debit/credit cards as well as PayPal as payment\nmethods. In countries where our users are more concentrated, we plan to\ngradually add additional payment gateways. Users will be charged in their\nlocal currency for these additional payment methods.\n\n### How do the various quality options differ?\n\nAt Writesonic, we understand that every content requirement is unique. That's\nwhy we offer two quality options to generate content based on your quantity\nand quality needs.\n\nOur Premium quality option runs on GPT-3.5 and our custom-trained models,\nensuring top-notch content output. For even higher quality, our Superior\nquality option runs on GPT-4 and our other custom models.\n\nPremium quality offers 6x more content than Superior quality. So with higher-\nquality models, the quantity will decrease. But the higher the model, the\nhigher the quality and length of the outputs generated.\n\nHowever, for the best quality content, we recommend using the Superior\nquality, where our largest model trained on billions of parameters runs. It\nunderstands your context and generates intelligent content, and the output\nlength is 6000 words at a time against the output length of 3000 words in the\nPremium model.\n\nBut if you require faster content generation with reasonably good quality,\nthen the Premium option is ideal for you.\n\n## Power up your business with AI:\n\nJoin 5M+ professionals & teams\n\nLet Writesonic be the catalyst for your business's transformation.\n\nGet Started Free\n\n## Tools\n\nAI Article and Blog WriterParaphrasing ToolSentence ExpanderText\nSummarizerStory Generator Landing Page Generator\n\n## Free Tools\n\nAI Content Detector\n\n## Products\n\nChatsonic Botsonic Audiosonic Photosonic\n\n## Resources\n\nBlogGuides and TutorialsAPIFree TemplatesStatus\n\n## Company\n\nContact Us About UsCareersHelp CenterWritesonic PricingBotsonic\nPricingAffiliate ProgramCreator Program\n\n\u00a9 2023 Writesonic, Inc.
