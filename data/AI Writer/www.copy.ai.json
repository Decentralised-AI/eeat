However, you can build any\ntext-based message or campaign with Chat. And you can scale any text-based\ncampaign with Workflows.  \n\nWhat are Workflows?\n\nWorkflows by Copy.ai is a brand new AI-powered automation platform that\nempowers teams to automate processes and campaigns at scale. Simply type the\nprocesses you want to automate, verify the results, and run it at scale.\n\nWhat are Workflow credits?\n\nA credit refers to a unit that represents a specific amount of generated\ncontent or access to certain features within the platform for example,\ninternet searches, scanning websites, and more.\n\nWhat is a credit worth?\n\nA credit's value depends on the complexity of the tasks performed within\nCopy.ai, such as generating text, or using the API. Each workflow run might\nhave different credit consumption, depending on the steps and content it\ngenerates.\n\nHow much does a workflow run cost?\n\nHow much a workflow run costs depends on the complexity of the workflow. The\nmore steps and content a workflow generates, the more it'll cost in credits.\nYou can see how much a run costs by opening the side panel and looking at the\n\"Credits used\" for the run.\n\nCan I change my plan later?\n\nYes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. If you choose to upgrade,\nyou'll pay a prorated amount for the rest of the month. If you choose to\ndowngrade, you'll be credited on next month's bill.\n\nWhich plans allow for unlimited words?\n\nUnlimited words are available on Pro, Team, Growth, Scale and Enterprise\nplans.\n\nDo you have a sales team?\n\nYes, you can contact our sales team to book a demo for our Enterprise plans.\n\nPlatform\n\nAI Marketing OS\n\nAI Sales OS\n\nChat by Copy.ai\n\nWorkflow Templates\n\nAI Prompt Library\n\nAI Tools\n\nCopy.ai API\n\nUse Cases\n\nTranslations\n\nBlog Content\n\nSocial Media Posts\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nResources\n\nBlog\n\nCopy.ai Guides\n\nWebinars\n\nWorkflow Tutorials\n\nSecurity at Copy.ai\n\nPress\n\nSupport\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nContact Us\n\nReport a Bug\n\nReport an Outage\n\nRequest a New Feature\n\nCompare\n\nAlternatives\n\nCopy.ai vs Jasper.ai\n\nCopy.ai vs. ChatGPT\n\nCopy.ai vs. Writesonic\n\nCopy.ai vs. Writer\n\n\u00a9 2023 CopyAI, Inc.\n\nCareers\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nTerms of Service\n\nStatus\n\n",
