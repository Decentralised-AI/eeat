It helps creators use\ngenerative AI to break through writer\u2019s block, create original imagery, and\nrepackage content into different formats, tones and languages. Unlike most AI\ntools which are tied to individual tools and can produce pretty generic\noutputs, Jasper can be trained on your brand and called up on any platform you\nuse from email to social media to your website.\n\n\u200d\n\nOver 100,000 businesses small and large use Jasper to scale up content and\nrate their experience 4.8/5 stars in over 10k reviews.\n\nIs Jasper for me?\n\nIf you're on this page, then chances are someone referred you to Jasper, you\nGoogled something related to AI and Marketing, or you saw an ad that caught\nyour attention... so it's not a coincidence that you're reading this right\nnow.\n\n**These 4 key differentiators are why Jasper is the best AI for businesses:**\n\n  1. Jasper is built by Marketers for Marketers, so not only is the AI trained on high-performing copy, the intuitive UI/UX is designed for creating content for all types of campaigns. Whether you are a social media manager, SEO specialist, ads manager, email marketer, or you're in marketing leadership then Jasper will be you're home-base for creating content. \n  2. If staying on-brand is important for you, then Jasper is the only AI solution for you. Other AIs sound generic... like a robot wrote it. Jasper is different. You can upload your brand's writing style guide, or feed Jasper a piece of content, and the AI will analyze that writing style to mimic your tone of voice. Not only does the AI write on-brand, it helps keep everyone on your team writing on-brand as well because we know how important keeping a consistent message is across all channels.\n  3. Productivity is a big reason for looking at AI solutions, but 99% of AIs are siloed in their own app. Jasper has a large partnership ecosystem where we have brought AI into the tools you use everyday. You can also add Jasper to your Chrome or Edge browser to bring your AI writing assistant everywhere you work \u2013 like Gmail, Wordpress, Docs, HubSpot, LinkedIn, or any other tabs you may have open. Jasper's extension is your brainstorming buddy for getting content going, or a friendly editor to review & improve your message before you press send.\n  4. If your company has a team of people creating content, then you'll want an AI platform that enables collaboration while also securing access to certain content. Jasper is a multi-player AI platform where you can assign work, see status updates, and set workspace defaults for AI features like setting your brand-voice, teaching the AI about your products, and setting a language default.\n\nSo in summary, Jasper is for you if you want high-performing content written\nquickly with AI that is factually accurate and always on-brand. You may start\nalone on the Creator or Teams plan, and then upgrade to Business as your team\ngrows and you need access to enterprise-ready features like API access, custom\nAI templates, and hands-on support.\n\nStart your free trial today to see what amazing content Jasper will write for\nyou!\n\nHow much does Jasper cost?\n\nJasper's pricing is transparent and meets your business needs as you grow.\nThere are three plans to choose from:\n\n  *  **Business:** (custom pricing tailored for your company's needs) **  \n**Includes personalized AI features with additional control, security, team\ntraining & tech support.\n\n  * \u200d **Teams:** $99/mo billed yearly at $1188 (Save 20%) or $125/mo billed monthly (cancel anytime).  \nIncludes **** advanced AI features to create content for multiple brands &\ncollaborate on campaigns. **\u200d**\n\n  *  **Creator:** Plan costs $39/mo billed yearly at $468 (Save 20%) or $49/mo billed monthly (cancel anytime).   \nIncludes powerful AI features to create & improve your content everywhere you\nwork online.  \n\nWhen comparing these plans, you'll notice the difference is between the number\nof team seats and feature you get.
