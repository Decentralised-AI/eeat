Jasper is built by Marketers for Marketers, so not only is the AI trained on high-performing copy, the intuitive UI/UX is designed for creating content for all types of campaigns. Whether you are a social media manager, SEO specialist, ads manager, email marketer, or you're in marketing leadership then Jasper will be you're home-base for creating content. \n  2. If staying on-brand is important for you, then Jasper is the only AI solution for you. Other AIs sound generic... like a robot wrote it. Jasper is different. You can upload your brand's writing style guide, or feed Jasper a piece of content, and the AI will analyze that writing style to mimic your tone of voice. Not only does the AI write on-brand, it helps keep everyone on your team writing on-brand as well because we know how important keeping a consistent message is across all channels.\n  3. Productivity is a big reason for looking at AI solutions, but 99% of AIs are siloed in their own app. Jasper has a large partnership ecosystem where we have brought AI into the tools you use everyday. You can also add Jasper to your Chrome or Edge browser to bring your AI writing assistant everywhere you work \u2013 like Gmail, Wordpress, Docs, HubSpot, LinkedIn, or any other tabs you may have open. Jasper's extension is your brainstorming buddy for getting content going, or a friendly editor to review & improve your message before you press send.\n  4. If your company has a team of people creating content, then you'll want an AI platform that enables collaboration while also securing access to certain content. Jasper is a multi-player AI platform where you can assign work, see status updates, and set workspace defaults for AI features like setting your brand-voice, teaching the AI about your products, and setting a language default.\n\nSo in summary, Jasper is for you if you want high-performing content written\nquickly with AI that is factually accurate and always on-brand.
