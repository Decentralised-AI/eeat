High ratings, high praises\n\n> \u201cFor a writing app with a simpler interface [\u2026] check out iA Writer, which\n> has little on-screen clutter like buttons and controls. The app borrows the\n> look and feel of its writing interface from a traditional typewriter,\n> including the font you type in. The app\u2019s cleverest feature is its \u201cfocus\n> mode,\u201d which fades out everything else in your document other than the line\n> or paragraph you\u2019re working on. This works similarly to how your eyes stay\n> focused on the words you have just typed on the paper when using a\n> traditional typewriter. Another clever option with iA Writer is that you can\n> highlight adjectives, nouns, verbs and the like in different colors, which\n> may prevent overdecorating of text. To preview the final result, there is a\n> visually neat mode that shows what the document would look like if printed\n> in a traditional book format. The app also has some traditional word\n> processing tricks like find and replace, and you can export your text in a\n> format that is compatible with other word processors, including Microsoft\n> Word.\u201d **\u2013Now You Can Write the Great American Novel on the Subway**\n\n> \u201cFor writers, whether they be students, professionals, or aspiring authors,\n> nothing is as liberating (or intimidating) as the blank page. iA Writer Pro\n> takes this principle and extends it to the screen, wiping away other apps\n> and menu bars to free users of distractions. But the app doesn\u2019t stop there;\n> it can also help you write more clearly with a syntax feature that\n> highlights adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs and other terms. Cut the\n> modifiers to tighten your prose and sharpen your verbs to make your\n> sentences pop.\u201d **\u2013The 10 Best Apps For Your New Mac**\n\n> \u201cOne of the most successful iPad wordprocessing apps over the past couple of\n> years is iA Writer, a simple tool that gets rid of all the options, font\n> choices, distractions and corrections that come with more elaborate\n> programs. It has won a lot of fans by doing one thing very simply and its\n> creator, Oliver Reichenstein, has likened it to a scalpel in a world of\n> Swiss army knives. iA Writer is an example of how powerful simplicity and\n> accessibility can be for creating commercially successful interfaces,\n> applications or services. This is true even if you\u2019re a newbie up against\n> the software world\u2019s leading heavyweights.\u201d **\u2013Radically simple designs\n> always win**\n\n> \u201cWriter is not, like Pages, a desktop publishing application. It\u2019s not\n> really even a textual editor, in the sense that it supports easy correction\n> or rearrangement of already-typed text. When you put the application in\n> \u201cFocus Mode,\u201d it doesn\u2019t even have spellcheck or cut-and-paste. Instead,\n> it\u2019s all about textual production \u2014 writing this phrase, this sentence, this\n> word at this moment. As the creators note, \u201cthe idea is to activate it when\n> you get stuck, blinding out everything else.\u201d It\u2019s not particularly\n> customizable, but again, that\u2019s the point. Don\u2019t screw around picking out\n> margins or font. We\u2019ve picked it for you \u2014 and it\u2019s already optimized for\n> your screen.\u201d **\u2013Writer for iPad Aims For Focus, Beauty, Simplicity**\n\n> \u201c\u2026 a clean and distraction-free environment\u2026 a plain text editor for\n> Markdown aficionados.\u201d **\u2013Tools That Aid Persuasive Writing**\n\n> \u201cThe main feature of iA Writer is not having many features. The program is,\n> essentially, a white rectangle, where the user can do little else but type\n> in a custom monospaced font. There are no headers, footers, drawing tools,\n> or chatty paper-clip assistants. The bare-bones interface uses special\n> characters in a simple formatting language called Markdown to bold,\n> italicize, or otherwise transform text\u2014a way of encouraging writers to keep\n> their hands on the keyboard and their minds on their work.\u201d **\u2013Can\n> \u201cDistraction-Free\u201d Devices Change the Way We Write?**\n\n### Our customers\n\n## We\u2019ve helped more than 2,000,000 people, just like you, share what\u2019s\nimportant to them since we first launched Writer over a decade ago.\n\n> \u201cMy favorite iOS app for writing in Markdown, without question, is iA Writer\n> iA Writer is just beautiful. To me it\u2019s the gold standard for Markdown\n> syntax styling \u2014 great colors, real italic and bold styling for _italic_ and\n> **bold** spans, and, my very favorite touch, outdented #\u2019s for headings. iA\n> Writer is even so presumptuous as to only use its own custom typefaces:\n> Mono, Duo, and Quattro. But they pull it off \u2014 all three of iA Writer\u2019s\n> typefaces are very good (I\u2019m a Duo man myself). The best way I can put it is\n> that iA Writer is a classy app. BBEdit and MarsEdit are like pint glasses or\n> coffee mugs. Occasionally, though, the mood calls for an elegant champagne\n> flute. That\u2019s iA Writer for me.\u201d **\u2013John Gruber, Creator of Markdown**\n\n> \u201cLike many professional writers, I reluctantly used Microsoft Word, and\n> Apple\u2019s Pages worked slightly better for me, but I still felt that it had\n> too many distractions. When I write, I want to be able to concentrate on\n> ideas, words, phrases and storylines. The last thing I need is software\n> nagging me with features irrelevant to the writing process. Since I\n> discovered iA Writer, I\u2019ve used it as my main writing tool. It has the\n> simplicity of a typewriter, which is why I love it. It\u2019s just letters,\n> sentences and paragraphs that form angles, headlines, narratives, articles\n> and scripts. There\u2019s no noise, no interference and no clutter. There\u2019s also\n> no hiding from what you really need to do, which is to wrestle with words\n> and craft a compelling read.\u201d **\u2013Dimitri Michels, Senior Copywriter,\n> Amsterdam.**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not a professional writer, but I write for recreation and the cleanness\n> of the iA writer platform really helps me get into a mood where writing is\n> relaxing. I used to write in MS Word, Pages and Google Docs. But writing\n> felt very structured and less driven by creativity. After finding iA Writer,\n> writing has become more of a flow. I find I\u2019m not concerned at all by end\n> formatting or choosing a font. And I\u2019m not distracted by menu bars, which is\n> a plus when working on a smaller screen like an iPad Pro.\u201d **\u2013Kenneth Saw,\n> Project Manager, Australia.**\n\n> \u201cMy creative writing work was a disorganized mess of files before iA Writer.\n> Finding iA Writer brought clarity, organization, and regular, focused\n> writing. I have written the best poetry of my life in iA Writer.\u201d **\u2013Dan\n> Knauss, Web Designer, Writer, Canada.**\n\n> \u201cAs a volunteer, I teach a course in programming and general nerdiness to a\n> group of children on the autistic spectrum. It turned out that it wasn\u2019t all\n> that easy to find the right course material and I ended up writing it myself\n> and turning it into something of a proper book. Seeing the children actually\n> use my material and improve themselves, having fun with it, changed\n> something in me, but I think also in those children. Some of them really\n> found their future in what we were teaching them. I doubt that I would\u2019ve\n> undertaken writing that course material if I wasn\u2019t confident that my editor\n> wouldn\u2019t be in my way.\u201d **\u2013David van Gemeren, Creative Director,\n> Netherlands.**\n\n> \u201cBefore I started using iA Writer I was, to put it bluntly, all over the\n> place and too easily distracted. Writer changed all that for me. I\n> immediately fell in love with the beautiful streamlined look and feel of the\n> app. No distractions, a beautiful uncluttered look and an elegant typeface.\n> This all meant that the writing flowed more easily. The year after iA Writer\n> was launched, I used it to write a story which was performed on the radio,\n> and at a literary festival, winning a major radio award here in Ireland.\n> That story pretty much was the real start of my writing life. Since then I\n> have had many short stories, poems and non-fiction articles published and\n> broadcast on national and local radio.\u201d **-Patrick Griffin, Writer,\n> Ireland**\n\n> \u201cBefore iA Writer, I didn\u2019t really write much. But at some point I was\n> looking for a simple Markdown editor. Three years later, I find myself using\n> this editor to think. I write my process, then grind over it to find flaws\n> until I make things clear. The documents I deliver to my team benefit from\n> this too. But the outcome I had never expected was something else. I just\n> began writing fiction. I can not recall why or when, I had not put two words\n> together for pure leisure probably since I was twelve, but suddenly, I felt\n> compelled, there was something inside me trying to get out, and now a\n> monster of hundreds of thousands of words is taking all my free time, and I\n> am happier than ever. I started writing a thriller, spies in the middle of a\n> made-up war in the nineties. But this year real life struck me hard and I\n> switched to romance, looking for something cheerier. Also with spies, of\n> course. One can never get enough spies in a story. I will never know whether\n> iA Writer had anything to do with this or not, but I feel confident it did\n> because I had not felt so comfortable using a piece of software before. It\n> doesn\u2019t get in my way, it is calm but inviting, inspiring in its raw\n> elegance. It just feels right. I dare to say iA Writer helped me see how\n> much I can love writing.\u201d **-Inmaculada Bermejo Salar, UX Designer, Writer,\n> Spain**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m dyslexic, and I found other writing tools such as Pages and Microsoft\n> Word very difficult to use. I also work as a digital designer, so I spent a\n> lot of time instead of writing trying to make the page look pretty \u2013 this\n> was probably a coping mechanic lol. I\u2019ve been using iA Writer for about two\n> years now, and personally, I find it much easier to write. Markdown forces\n> me to focus on my writing, making the process a lot easier for me. I\u2019m no\n> longer worried about fonts, layouts, sizing, etc. I also love the syntax\n> highlighting tool \u2013 it really helps me focus with my dyslexia; as sentences\n> become colourful, each word becomes easier to distinguish. I feel a whole\n> lot more confident writing nowadays now that I have iA writer. I have both\n> the iOS and Mac versions. As both versions work together, I find myself\n> confidently writing on my iPhone / iPad, knowing that I will pick it up once\n> I\u2019m back on my Mac \u2013 it\u2019s great!\u201d **\u2013Rizwaan Akhtar, Digital Designer,\n> United Kingdom**\n\n> \u201cI write academic papers, translations, book chapters, and the like using\n> iAW. Before switching, I wrote much less frequently and in lesser quantities\n> than I do now. The beauty and clarity of the tool imparts a measure of\n> beauty and clarity to my prose. The medium is the message, as Marshall\n> McLuhan said. I think his insight proves true in my particular case insofar\n> as iAW speeds up my thought, declutters my awareness, and draws my\n> attention. The tool itself reminds me of my favorite book on writing: Strunk\n> and White\u2019s _Elements of Style_, particularly Strunk\u2019s rule Omit needless\n> words. By omitting all that is not needed in a writing tool, the tool itself\n> becomes as concise and elegant as the prose that it is meant to capture.\n> Now, even in the midst of academic administrative duties, I find it possible\n> to write at least two serious original conference papers a year, and this\n> year I have already managed to double that productivity. iA Writer is easily\n> one of my most important and beloved tools.\u201d **\u2013Andrew Hayes, Division Dean,\n> Associate Professor, Texas**\n\n> \u201cBefore I found iA Writer I used to write much less and the tools I used to\n> write on my computer were confusing and frustrating. These days, I use iA\n> Writer for absolutely everything: from drafting a short email, making to-do\n> lists, to outlining a major article or book chapter. I can\u2019t begin to\n> describe the pleasure I get from an evening writing session, laptop sitting\n> on my uncluttered desk, iA Writer on full-screen + dark appearance + focus\n> sentence mode. The blue cursor blinking at the centre of my screen triggers\n> a deep desire to put words down, follow a train of thought, elaborate on an\n> idea\u2026 I have been trying to significantly cut down on my screen-time, but I\n> can\u2019t imagine my life without iA Writer; it is an integral part of my\n> workflow as a writer (I\u2019m a professor, so I have to write papers and prepare\n> lectures constantly). iA Writer is the perfect tool to draft a text. It is a\n> pleasure to use, like a perfectly sharp knife. I wrote my entire PhD thesis\n> on iA Writer. It felt like discovering a magical sword on the third-act of a\n> hero\u2019s journey. Thank you for all your work through the years. iA Writer has\n> changed my relationship with writing; I feel the same connection to this\n> software that old-time writers used to feel with their typewriters.\u201d **\u2013Jo\u00e3o\n> Ferreira, Assistant Professor (Design), Portugal**\n\n> \u201cDiscovering iA Writer and Markdown changed my life! It was so clear and\n> simple yet super efficient. I often have problems concentrating for a long\n> period of time and get massive headaches. I found myself writing faster\n> using iA because I\u2019m not bothered by formatting or exporting. I just have to\n> write my stuff and I know it will be fine. I love the minimalist style which\n> is kind with my eyes and focus mode, like a typewriter, reminds me of when I\n> was playing with my grandfather\u2019s. This year I left a job I didn\u2019t like to\n> become a full time freelance writer and you played a great role in this. You\n> help me to stay focused and efficient without distraction. It\u2019s precious\n> nowadays. Because of this, I have more time to spend with my family. My\n> sister lives in Switzerland and my writing best friend in Japan. It makes me\n> smile to see iA is like us.\u201d **\u2013C\u00e9cile Biaudet, Writer, SEO, France**\n\n> \u201cAstonishingly simple. Everything goes away except for the writing\n> experience.\u201d **\u2013 Stephen Fry describing his iA Writer experience in 2010\n> when asked about his favorite apps on the iPad**\n\n  * ### iA Newsletter\n\n  * Subscribe to receive product updates, announcements, and a look behind the scenes.
