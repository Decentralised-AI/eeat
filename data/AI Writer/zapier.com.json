While they aren't _taking over the world_ (yet), they are rapidly\nmaturing and have reached the point where they can absolutely be useful\u2014at\nleast in the right circumstances. Used correctly, these _AI text generators_\ncan help you work better and faster, and create more polished and on-brand\ncopy.\n\nOf course, all AI writing software needs human supervision to deliver the best\nresults. Left to its own devices, it tends to produce _fairly generic and\nfrequently incorrect_ content, even if it can pass for something a human\nwrote. Now that AI tools are increasingly popular, people also seem more aware\nof what bland AI-produced content reads like and are likely to spot it\u2014or at\nleast be suspicious of content that feels like it lacks something.\n\nHow to use OpenAI's GPT to spark content ideas\n\nLearn how\n\nI've been covering this kind of generative AI technology for almost a decade.\nSince AI is supposedly trying to take my job, I'm somewhat professionally\ninterested in the whole situation. Still, I think I'm pretty safe for now.\nThese AI writing tools are getting incredibly impressive, but you have to work\n_with_ them, rather than just letting them spit out whatever they want.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an AI content generator that will help you write\ncompelling copy, publish blog posts a lot quicker, and otherwise take some of\nthe slow-paced typing out of writing, you've come to the right place. Let's\ndig in.\n\n## The best AI writing software\n\n  * Jasper for businesses\n\n  * Copy.ai for copywriting\n\n  * Anyword for assisting you with writing\n\n  * Sudowrite for fiction\n\n  * Writer for a non-GPT option\n\n  * Writesonic for GPT-4 content\n\n  * Rytr for an affordable AI writer\n\n## How do AI writing tools work?\n\nSearch Google for AI writing software, and you'll find dozens of different\noptions, all with suspiciously similar features. There's a big reason for\nthis: 95% of these AI writing tools use the same _large language models\n(LLMs)_ as the back end.\n\nSome of the bigger apps are also integrating their own fine-tuning or using\nother LLMs like _Claude_. But most are really just wrappers connected to\nOpenAI's _GPT-3 and GPT-4_ APIs, with a few extra features built on top\u2014even\nif they try to hide it in their own marketing materials. If you wanted to, you\ncould even create your own version of an AI writing assistant without code\nusing _Zapier's OpenAI integrations_\u2014that's how much these apps rely on GPT.\n\nSee how one writer created an AI writing coach with GPT and other ways you can\nuse OpenAI with Zapier.\n\nNow this isn't to say that none of these AI-powered writing apps are worth\nusing. They all offer a much nicer workflow than ChatGPT or _OpenAI's\nplayground_, both of which allow you to generate text with GPT as well. And\nthe better apps allow you to set a \"voice\" or guidelines that apply to all the\ntext you generate. But the difference between these apps isn't really in the\n_quality_ of their output. With a few exceptions, you'll get very similar\nresults from the same prompt no matter which app you use\u2014even if they use\ndifferent LLMs. Where the apps on this list stand out is in how easy they make\nit to integrate AI text generation into an actual workflow.\n\nAs for the underlying LLM models themselves, they work by taking a _prompt_\nfrom you, and then predicting what words will best follow on from your\nrequest, based on the data they were trained on. That training data includes\nbooks, articles, and other documents across all different topics, styles, and\ngenres\u2014and an unbelievable amount of content _scraped from the open internet_.\nBasically, LLMs were allowed to crunch through the sum total of human\nknowledge to form a deep learning neural network\u2014a complex, many-layered,\nweighted algorithm modeled after the human brain. Yes, that's the kind of\nthing you have to do to create a computer program that _generates bad poems_.\n\nIf you want to dive more into the specifics, check out the Zapier articles on\n_natural language processing_ and _how ChatGPT works_. But suffice it to say:\nGPT and other large language models are incredibly powerful already\u2014and\nbecause of that, these AI writing tools have a lot of potential.\n\n## What makes the best AI text generator?\n\n##### How we evaluate and test apps\n\nAll of our best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their\ncareers using, testing, and writing about software. We spend dozens of hours\nresearching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and\nevaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid\nfor placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site\u2014we value\nthe trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories\nand apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of\nhow we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog.\n\nWe know that most AI text generators rely on the various versions of GPT, and\neven those that don't are using very similar models, so most apps aren't going\nto stand out because of some dramatic difference in the quality of their\noutput. Creating effective, _human-like text_ is now table stakes. It was\nrequired for inclusion on this list\u2014but not sufficient on its own.\n\nAs I was testing these apps, here's what else I was looking for:\n\n  *  **Tools powered by GPT or a similar large language model with well-documented efficacy.** In practice, this means that most but not all of the AI writing tools on this list use GPT to a greater or lesser degree. Many apps are starting to hide what models they use and claim to have a lot of secret sauce built on top (because there's a marketing advantage in being different and more powerful), but the reality is that nine times out of ten, it's the GPT API that's doing the heavy lifting.\n\n  *  **An interface that gives you a lot of control over the text output.** The more options you have to influence the tone, style, language, content, and everything else, the better. I didn't want tools where you just entered a headline and let the AI do the rest; these are all tools that you collaborate with, so you can write great copy quickly. The best AI writing tools also let you set a default brand voice that's always on.\n\n  *  **Ease of use.** You shouldn't have to fight to get the AI to do what you want. With AI writing software like this, there will always be some redoing and reshaping to get the exact output you want, but working with the AI shouldn't feel like wrangling a loose horse. Similarly, great help docs and good onboarding were both a major plus. \n\n  *  **Affordability.** ChatGPT is currently free, and all these tools are built on top of _an API that costs pennies_. There was no hard and fast price limit, but the more expensive tools had to justify the extra expense with better features and a nicer app. After all, almost every app will produce pretty similar outputs regardless of what it costs. \n\n  *  **Apps that weren't designed to make spam content.** Previous text-generating tools could \" _spin_\" content by changing words to synonyms so that unscrupulous website owners could rip off copyrighted material and generally create lots of low-quality, low-value content. None of that on this list.\n\nEven with these criteria, I had more than 40 different AI writing tools to\ntest. Remember: it's relatively easy for a skilled developer to build a\nwrapper around the GPT API, so I had to dig deep into each one to find out if\nit was any good or just had a flashy marketing site.\n\nI tested each app by getting it to write a number of different short- and\nlong-form bits of copy, but as expected, there were very few meaningful\nquality differences. Instead, it was the overall user experience, depth of\nfeatures, and affordability that determined whether an app made this list.\n\n _Zapier's AI Chatbot builder_ lets you build custom AI chatbots and take\naction with built-in automation\u2014no coding required. Try the _writing assistant\ntemplate_ to help you create high quality content, effortlessly.\n\n## The best AI writing generators at a glance\n\n ****\n\n|\n\n **Best for**\n\n|\n\n **Standout feature**\n\n|\n\n **Pricing**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n **Jasper**\n\n|\n\nBusinesses\n\n|\n\nMature and feature-filled AI content generation\n\n|\n\nCreator plan from $49/month; Teams plan from $125/month  \n  \n **Copy.ai**\n\n|\n\nCopywriting\n\n|\n\nActive solicitation of user input, affordable unlimited plan for high-volume\nusers\n\n|\n\nFree plan available (2,000 words/month); Pro plan from $49/month  \n  \n **Anyword**\n\n|\n\nAssisting you with writing\n\n|\n\nEasy inclusion of specific details and SEO keywords, engagement scores for\ncontent\n\n|\n\nStarter plan from $49/month  \n  \n **Sudowrite**\n\n|\n\nFiction writing\n\n|\n\nTailored AI assistance for writing fiction, easy-to-use interface\n\n|\n\nHobby & Student plan from $19/month  \n  \n **Writer**\n\n|\n\nNon-GPT content\n\n|\n\nTransparency regarding AI model, effective as an editor for adhering to style\nguides\n\n|\n\nTeam plan from $18/user/month  \n  \n **Writesonic**\n\n|\n\nGPT-4 content\n\n|\n\nChoice of GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models\n\n|\n\nFree plan available (10,000 GPT-3.5 words/month); Business plan from $19/month  \n  \n **Rytr**\n\n|\n\nAnd affordable option\n\n|\n\nFree and affordable plans\n\n|\n\nFree plan available (10,000 characters/month); Saver plan from $9/month  \n  \n* * *\n\n## Best AI writing generator for businesses\n\n###  _Jasper_ (Web)\n\n **Jasper pros:**\n\n  * One of the most mature and feature-filled options on the list \n\n  * Integrates with Grammarly, Surfer, and its own AI art generator\n\n **Jasper cons:**\n\n  * Expensive given that all the apps use similar language models \n\nJasper (formerly Jarvis) is one of the most feature-filled and powerful AI\ncontent generators. It was among the first wave of apps built on top of GPT,\nand its relative longevity means that it feels like a more mature tool than\nmost of the other apps I tested. It's continued to grow and develop in the\nmonths since I first compiled this list.\n\nIf you have a business and budget isn't your primary concern, _Jasper_ should\nbe one of the first apps you try. It's pivoted to mostly focus on marketing\ncampaigns rather than just generating generic AI content. That's not a bad\nthing, but it means that plans now start at $49/month for individual creators\nand $125/month for teams.\n\nJasper has also moved away from just being a GPT app. It claims to combine\n\"several large language models\" including GPT-4, Claude 2, and PaLM 2, so that\n\"you get the highest quality outputs and superior uptime.\" While I can't say\nthat I noticed a massive difference between Jasper's output and any other\napp's, it does give you a few solid controls so that your content matches your\nbrand.\n\nYou can create a brand _Voice and Tone_ by uploading some appropriate sample\ntext. Based on a few examples of my writing, Jasper created a style that\n\"emphasizes a casual, conversational tone with humor, personal anecdotes,\nlisticles, informal language, expertise in various subjects, and a call to\naction for an engaging and approachable brand voice.\" I don't think that's a\nbad summary of the content I fed in, and its output for a few test blog posts\nlike \"The Enduring Popularity of Top Gun\" felt closer to my writing than when\nI asked it to use a generic casual tone of voice. Similarly, there's a\n_Knowledge Base_ **** where you can add facts about your business and products\nso Jasper gets important details right.\n\nWhile other apps also offer similar features, Jasper's seemed to work better\nand are fully integrated with the rest of the app. For example, you can create\nentire marketing campaigns using your custom brand voice. Put a bit of work\ninto fine-tuning it and uploading the right assets to your knowledge base, and\nI suspect that Jasper really could create some solid first drafts of marketing\nmaterials like blog outlines, social media campaign ads, and the like.\n\nOtherwise, Jasper rounds things out with some nice integrations. It has a\nbuilt-in ChatGPT competitor and AI art generator (though, again, lots of other\napps have both), plays nice with the SEO app _Surfer_, and there's a _browser\nextension_ to bring Jasper everywhere.\n\nYou can also connect Jasper to thousands of other apps using Zapier. Learn\nmore about how to automate Jasper, or try one of the pre-built workflows\nbelow.\n\n### Create product descriptions in Jasper from new or updated Airtable records\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nAirtable, Jasper\n\nAirtable + Jasper\n\nMore details\n\nGenerate content quickly and easily in Airtable by leveraging Jasper's\ntemplate endpoint to create product descriptions. This integration starts\nwhenever there's a new or updated record in Airtable; it calls the Jasper API\nto run the product description template and add it to an Airtable record.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n### Create Jasper blog posts from new changes to specific column values in\nmonday.com and save the text in Google Docs documents\n\nTry it\n\n  *   * +2\n  * \n\nmonday.com, Google Docs, Jasper\n\nmonday.com + Google Docs + Jasper\n\nMore details\n\nHarness the power of Jasper where you work by generating blog post content\nfrom within monday.com. This Zap automatically triggers based on a new change\nto a specific column value in monday.com, making an API call to Jasper to pass\nrelevant content in as inputs to the Create a Blogpost API. Once the text is\ngenerated, it is saved as a document in Google Docs and updates the task in\nmonday.com to mark it as done, set a date, and include a URL to the document.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n### Run Jasper commands and send Slack channel messages with new pushed\nmessages in Slack\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nSlack, Jasper\n\nSlack + Jasper\n\nMore details\n\nSet up this Zap to use Zapier's \"Push to Zapier\" functionality to generate\ncontent using Jasper based on each new pushed Slack message. This Zap, which\ncan be triggered on any Slack message in a public channel, sends the message\nto Jasper's Commands endpoint to generate content. The generated content is\nthen posted as a message in the same Slack channel automatically, allowing you\nto easily summarize content, generate five bullet points for a blog post,\nrewrite content, and more.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n **Jasper pricing:** Creator plan from $49/month with one brand voice and 50\nknowledge assets. Teams plan starts at $125/month for three seats, three brand\nvoices, and 150 knowledge assets.\n\n## Best AI writing app for AI copywriting\n\n###  _Copy.ai_ (Web)\n\n **Copy.ai pros:**\n\n  * Has an affordable unlimited plan for high-volume users \n\n  * Workflow actively solicits your input, which can lead to higher quality content \n\n **Copy.ai cons:**\n\n  * Expensive if you don't produce a lot of content\n\nPretty much anything Jasper can do, Copy.ai can do too. It has brand voices,\nan infobase, a chatbot, and team features (though there isn't a browser\nextension). Consider it the Burger King to Jasper's McDonalds.\n\nAnd like the Home of the Whopper, Copy.ai appeals to slightly different\ntastes. While I could argue that Copy.ai has a nicer layout, the reality is\nit's geared toward a slightly different workflow. While Jasper lets you and\nthe AI loose, Copy.ai slows things down a touch and encourages you to work\nwith its chatbot or use a template that asks some deliberate, probing\nquestions. For creating website copy, _social media captions_, product\ndescriptions, and similarly specific things, it makes more sense. But for\ncontent marketing blog posts and other long-form content, it might annoy you.\n\nThe other big difference is the pricing. While both offer plans for $49/month,\nCopy.ai includes five user seats and unlimited brand voices. For a small team\nworking with multiple brands, it can be a lot cheaper. Also, if you're looking\nfor a free AI writing generator, Copy.ai also offers a free plan that includes\n2,000 words per month.\n\nOverall, there are _more similarities than differences between Jasper and\nCopy.ai_, and both can create almost all the same kinds of text. Even when it\ncame to analyzing my voice, they both came to pretty similar conclusions.\nCopy.ai decided that, to mimic me, it had to \"focus on creating content that\nis both educational and entertaining, using a conversational tone that makes\nreaders feel like they're having a chat with a knowledgeable friend\" and \"not\nto be afraid to inject some humor or personal anecdotes.\" If you're in doubt,\ntry them both out and then decide.\n\nCopy.ai also _integrates with Zapier_, so you can do things like automatically\nsending content to your CMS or enriching leads straight from your CRM. Here\nare a couple examples to get you started.\n\n### Add new blog posts created with Copy.ai to Webflow\n\nTry it\n\n  *   * \n\nCopy.ai, Webflow\n\nCopy.ai + Webflow\n\nMore details\n\nWhen you generate new blog posts using Copy.ai, automatically add them to your\nWebflow CMS. This Zap will monitor your Copy.ai account for new blogs and\nautomatically post them to your Webflow site. Never miss publishing a new blog\npost again and keep your content fresh across platforms. Streamline your\ncontent creation and publishing process with the help of Zapier.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n### Enrich new Salesforce leads with Copy.ai\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nSalesforce, Copy.ai\n\nSalesforce + Copy.ai\n\nMore details\n\nWhen a new lead enters your Salesforce, automatically generate personalized\ncontent for them using Copy.ai. Copy.ai will enrich the lead info and create\nengaging copy tailored to that contact. The generated content is then saved\ndirectly back to the lead record in Salesforce for your sales team to\nleverage, ensuring a great first impression and higher quality conversations.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n **Copy.ai pricing:** Free for 2,000 words per month; from $49/month for the\nPro plan with 5 users and unlimited brand voices.\n\n## Best AI writing assistant\n\n###  _Anyword_ (Web)\n\n **Anyword pros:**\n\n  * Makes it very easy for you to include specific details, SEO keywords, and other important information \n\n  * Engagement scores and other metrics are surprisingly accurate\n\n **Anyword cons:**\n\n  * Can be slower to use \n\n  * Pretty expensive for a more limited set of features than some of the other apps on this list\n\nWhile you can direct the AI to include certain details and mention specific\nfacts for every app on this list, none make it as easy as Anyword. More than\nany of the others, the AI here feels like an eager and moderately competent\nunderling that requires a bit of micromanaging (and can also try to mimic your\nwriting style and brand voice), rather than a beast that you have to tame with\narcane prompts.\n\nTake one of its main content-generating tools: the Blog Wizard. Like with\nCopy.ai, the setup process requires you to describe the blog post you want the\nAI to create and add any SEO keywords you want to target. Anyword then\ngenerates a range of titles for you to choose from, along with a predicted\nengagement score.\n\nOnce you've chosen a title\u2014or written your own\u2014it generates a suggested\noutline. Approve it, and you get the option for it to create an entire\n~2,000-word blog post (boo!) or a blank document where you can prompt it with\nadditional instructions for each section of the outline, telling it things\nlike what facts to mention, what style to take, and what details to cover.\nThere's also a chatbot-like research sidebar that you can ask questions of and\nsolicit input from. While certainly a slower process than most apps, it gives\nyou a serious amount of control over the content you're creating.\n\nAnyword is definitely aimed at marketers, and its other tools\u2014like the Data-\nDriven Editor and the Website Targeted Message\u2014all allow you to target your\ncontent toward specific audiences and give things engagement scores. While I\ncertainly can't confirm the validity of any of these scores, they at least\npass the sniff test. I generally thought the AI-generated content that Anyword\nscored higher was better\u2014and even when I disagreed, I still liked one of the\ntop options.\n\n **Anyword pricing:** Starter plan from $49/month for 1 user and 1 brand\nvoice.\n\n## Best AI writing tool for writing fiction\n\n###  _Sudowrite_ (Web)\n\n **Sudowrite pros:**\n\n  * The only AI tool on the list explicitly aimed at writing fiction \n\n  * Super fun to use if you've ever wanted to play around with fiction \n\n **Sudowrite cons:**\n\n  * It's still an AI text generator, so it can produce nonsensical metaphors, clich\u00e9d plots, incoherent action, and has a short memory for details \n\n  * Very controversial in fiction writing circles\n\nWhen I saw Sudowrite's marketing copy, I didn't think for a second it would\nmake it onto this list. Then I tried it and\u2026I kind of love it. Sudowrite is a\ntotally different tool than all the others on this list because it's aimed at\nfiction writers. And with that, comes a lot of controversy. Sudowrite has been\ncalled \" _an insult to writers everywhere_\" and has been generally dismissed\nas a tool for hacks by a lot of Very Online writers. And while it's true that\nit's nowhere close to replacing a human author, it's fun, functional, and can\ngenuinely help with writing a work of fiction.\n\nThe Story Engine feature, which allows you to generate a full work of fiction\nover a few days by progressively generating each story beat, has attracted the\nmost attention ( _it works but takes lots of hand-holding_ and _your novel\nwill be weird_). But I prefer its assistive tools.\n\nLet's start with Describe. Select a word or phrase, click **Describe** , and\nthe AI will generate a few suggestions for the sight, smell, taste, sound, and\ntouch of the thing, as well as a couple of metaphors. If you're the kind of\nwriter who struggles to add sensory depth to your short stories, it can help\nyou get into the habit of describing things in more interesting ways.\n\nThen there's Brainstorm. It allows you to use the AI to generate possible\ndialogue options, character names and traits, plot points, places, and other\ndetails about your world from your descriptions and cues. If you know you want\na big hairy guy with a huge sword but can't think of a good name, it can\nsuggest a few, like Thorgrim and Bohart.\n\nAnd these are just scratching the surface. Sure, if you over-rely on the AI to\nsolve all your problems, you'll probably end up with an impressively generic\nstory. But if you use it as a writing buddy to bounce ideas off and get you\nout of a rut, it's got serious potential.\n\nBest of all, Sudowrite is super easy to use. The onboarding, tool tips, and\ngeneral helpful vibe of the app are something other developers could learn\nfrom.\n\n **Sudowrite pricing:** Hobby & Student plan from $19/month for 30,000 AI\nwords/month.\n\n## Best AI text generator for a non-GPT option\n\n###  ** _Writer_** **(Web)**\n\n **Writer pros:**\n\n  * Not based on GPT, so free of a lot of the controversy surrounding LLMs\n\n  * Surprisingly capable as an editor, making sure your team sticks to the style guide and doesn't make any wild claims\n\n **Writer cons:**\n\n  * Requires a lot more setup to get the most from\n\nGPT comes with quite a lot of baggage. OpenAI has been less than transparent\nabout exactly what data was used to create the various versions of GPT-3 and\nGPT-4, and it's _facing various lawsuits_ over the use of copyrighted material\nin its training dataset. No one is really denying that protected materials\u2014\n_potentially from pirated databases_\u2014were used to train GPT; the question is\njust whether or not it falls under fair use.\n\nFor most people, this is a nebulous situation filled with edge cases and gray\nareas. Realistically, it's going to be years before it's all sorted out, and\neven then, things will have moved on so far that the results of any lawsuit\nare likely to be redundant. But for businesses that want to use AI writing\ntools without controversy attached, GPT is a no-go\u2014and will be for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nWhich is where _Writer_ comes in.\n\nFeature-wise, Writer is much the same as any of my top picks. (Though creating\na specific brand voice that's automatically used is an Enterprise-only\nfeature; otherwise, you have to use a lot of checkboxes in the settings to set\nthe tone.) Some features, like the chatbot, are a little less useful than they\nare in the GPT-powered apps, but really, they're not why you'd choose Writer.\n\nWhere it stands out is the transparency around its _Palmyra LLM_. For example,\nyou can request and _inspect a copy of its training dataset_ that's composed\nof data that is \"distributed free of any copyright restrictions.\" Similarly,\nPalmyra's code and model weights (which determines its outputs) can be\naudited, it can be hosted on your own servers, and your data is kept secure\nand not used for training by default. As an AI-powered tool, it's as above\nboard as it comes.\n\nIn addition to generating text, Writer can work as a company-specific\nGrammarly-like editor, keeping on top of legal compliance, ensuring you don't\nmake any unsupported claims, and checking that everything matches your style\nguide\u2014even when humans are writing the text. As someone who routinely has to\nfollow style guides, this seems like an incredibly useful feature. I wasn't\nable to test it fully since I don't have a personal style guide to input, but\nWriter correctly fixed things based on all the rules that I set.\n\nIn side-by-side comparisons, Writer's text generations sometimes felt a little\nweaker than the ones from Jasper or Copy.ai, but I suspect a lot of that was\ndown to how things were configured. Writer is designed as a tool for companies\nto set up and train with their own data, not run right out of the box. I'd\nguess my random blog posts were a poor test of how it should be used in the\nreal world.\n\n _Writer also integrates with Zapier_, so you can use Writer to create content\ndirectly from whatever apps you use most. Learn more about _how to automate\nWriter_, or take a look at these pre-made workflows.\n\n### Create new outlines or drafts in Writer based on briefs from Asana\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nAsana, Writer, Google Docs\n\nAsana + Writer + Google Docs\n\nMore details\n\nWant to take the hard work out of starting an outline or a draft? Whether you\ncopy for blog posts, landing pages, or emails, this Zap lets Writer create\ncontent based on a new project that's added in Asana, then sends it straight\nto a Google Doc for you to edit or use.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n### Generate marketing content from project briefs in Trello\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nTrello, Writer, Dropbox\n\nTrello + Writer + Dropbox\n\nMore details\n\nAutomate your content creation process with Zapier and AI. With this workflow,\nyou can send prompts to Writer from a brief in a new Trello project. Zapier\nwill then take the content from Writer and add it to a Dropbox file for you to\nedit and use as you'd like.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n **Writer pricing:** Team from $18/user/month for up to 5 users; after that,\nit's an Enterprise plan.\n\n## Best AI text generator for GPT-4 content\n\n###  _Writesonic_ (Web)\n\n **Writesonic pros:**\n\n  * Allows you to select what GPT model is used to generate text \n\n  * Generous free plan and affordable paid plans \n\n **Writesonic cons:**\n\n  * A touch too focused on SEO content for my taste \n\nWhile almost all the tools on this list use GPT, most are pretty vague about\nwhich particular version of it they use at any given time. This matters\nbecause the most basic version of the GPT-3.5 Turbo API costs $0.002/1K tokens\n(roughly 750 words), while GPT-4 starts at $0.06/1K tokens, and the most\npowerful version costs $0.12/1K tokens. All this suggests that most apps may\nnot use GPT-4 in all circumstances, and instead probably rely on one of the\nmore modest (though still great) GPT-3 models for most text generation.\n\nIf having the _latest and greatest AI model_ matters to you, Writesonic is the\napp for you. _Writesonic_ doesn't hide what AI model it uses. It even allows\nyou to choose between using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, at least on Business plans.\n\nWhether the content you create will benefit from the extra power of GPT-4 or\nnot depends. In my experience using GPT-4 through ChatGPT, the latest model is\nmore accurate and, essentially, more sensible in how it responds. If you're\nchurning out low-stakes copy variations for your product listings, you likely\nwon't see much improvement. On the other hand, for long-form original blog\nposts, it could make a difference. Either way, the transparency in which model\nyou're using at any given time is a huge bonus.\n\nFeature-wise, Writesonic is much the same as any of the other apps on this\nlist, with a Google Docs-style editor, the option to set a brand voice, a few\ndozen copy templates, a chatbot, a browser extension, and Surfer integration.\nIt's cool that you can set reference articles when you're generating a blog\npost, but it introduces the real possibility of inadvertent plagiarism if you\naren't careful with how you use it. (Its most offbeat feature is a\nsurprisingly solid _AI-powered custom chatbot builder_ that's due to be spun\nout into its own app soon.) Overall, it's pretty nice to use and skews more\ntoward SEO-optimized content marketing\u2014but like with all the apps, you can use\nit to generate whatever you want.\n\n _Writesonic also integrates with Zapier_, so you can send new copy to any of\nthe other apps you use in your writing workflow. Learn more about _how to\nautomate Writesonic_, or get started with one of these examples.\n\n### Create a Google Doc with new content from Writesonic\n\nTry it\n\n  *   * \n\nWritesonic, Google Docs\n\nWritesonic + Google Docs\n\nMore details\n\nNever lose your content again: automatically send the content you produce in\nWritesonic to a Google Doc. Then you can easily collaborate with your team by\nhaving all your written content in one place.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n### Generate product descriptions with Writesonic from spreadsheet rows in\nGoogle Sheets\n\nTry it\n\n  *   *   * \n\nGoogle Sheets, Writesonic Bulk\n\nGoogle Sheets + Writesonic Bulk\n\nMore details\n\nThere are a lot of steps that go into getting a new product live on an\neCommerce site. Eliminate one of them by using Writesonic to generate your\nproduct descriptions automatically. As soon as a new row is added to your\nproduct database spreadsheet, Writesonic will draft a product description and\nadd it right back to that same spreadsheet row, ready for you to add to your\neCommerce platform.\n\nDetailsTry it\n\n **Writesonic pricing:** Free for 10,000 GPT-3.5 words per month; Business\nfrom $19/month for 200,000 Premium words or 33,333 GPT-4 words.\n\n## Best free AI writing generator (with affordable upgrades)\n\n###  _Rytr_ (Web)\n\n **Rytr pros:**\n\n  * A solid free plan and a cheap high-volume plan (though Writesonic offers better value for an unlimited plan) \n\n  * It includes a basic AI art generator as part of every plan \n\n **Rytr cons:**\n\n  * The app is more basic than more expensive offerings \n\n  * Unlimited plan isn't very competitive\n\nMost of the apps on this list are aimed at professionals, businesses, and\nanyone else with a budget. The Jasper, Copy.ai, and Anyword plans I considered\nall started at $49/month. That isn't exactly a hobbyist-friendly sum of money,\nso if you want to explore AI text generators without spending as much, give\nRytr a go.\n\nThere's a free plan that's good for 10,000 characters (around 2,500 words) per\nmonth, and it includes a lot of the features, like a plagiarism checker, and a\nfew AI-generated images. The Saver plan starts at $9/month and allows you to\ngenerate 100,000 characters (around 25,000 words) per month. On that plan,\nyou're also able to generate up to 20 images a month, which many other apps\ncharge extra for. (There's also an unlimited plan for $29/month, but at that\npoint, Writesonic is a better value.)\n\nFeature-wise, there are some trade-offs. Rytr is a little less competent at\ngenerating long-form content without you guiding it through the process, and\nthere are fewer templates for specific things. The interface also isn't as\npolished, and there isn't as much hand-holding to get you started. Still, as\nRytr is using GPT like almost all the other apps on this list, you should be\nable to get it to produce substantially similar output.\n\n **Rytr Pricing:** Free plan for 10,000 characters/month and lots of other\nfeatures; Saver plan from $9/month for 100,000 characters; Unlimited plan from\n$29/month.\n\n## Other AI writing tools to consider\n\nWith so many AI text-generating tools out there, a few good ones worth\nconsidering didn't make this list, only because they didn't meet my initial\ncriteria in some way. If none of the AI writers I chose fit the bill for you,\nhere are a few other options worth looking into:\n\n  *  _ChatGPT_ is surprisingly competent and fun to use. And best of all, it's free. ( _Google Bard_ is a little less excellent on the content production side.) \n\n  *  _Wordtune_ and _Grammarly_ are both great tools for _editing and improving your own writing_.  _GrammarlyGO_ just isn't as flexible as my other picks.\n\n  *  _Notion AI_ adds a powerful AI tool directly into Notion. If you already use Notion, it's worth checking out, but it's a lot to learn if you just want a text generator. (Same goes for AI within any other Notion alternative, like _Coda AI_.)\n\n  *  _Surfer_ and _Frase_ are both AI-powered SEO tools. They fell slightly out of scope for this list, but they can both help you optimize and improve your content\u2014AI-generated or not. \n\nAll of the apps on this list offer at the very least a free trial, so I'd\nsuggest trying some of them out for a few minutes until you find the one that\nseems to work best with your workflow.\n\n **Related reading:**\n\n  * How to use OpenAI's GPT to spark content ideas\n\n  * How to create an AI writing coach with GPT and Zapier\n\n  * 8 ways real businesses are using AI for content creation\n\n  * How to detect AI-generated content\n\n  * The best AI marketing tools\n\n _This article was originally published in April 2023.
