It is a valuable resource for those who need to generate content\nquickly but do not have the time or resources to do so themselves. However, it\nis important to note that it is not a replacement for an experienced writer or\neditor.

These integrations are\neasy to use, thanks to the API key offered by the platform.\n\nWhile the platform is a convenient tool for creating content, its output\nquality falls short of expectations. As with any automated system, fact-\nchecking is necessary for the majority of the content offered by the platform.\nThe platform does offer better output quality with customized input. However,\nextensive testing is required, which can quickly exhaust the \"word meter.\"\n\nOverall, Articleforge can significantly expedite the writing process and help\novercome writer's block. It is advisable to test it out and find a balance\nbetween the platform and tailored input to yield superior results. While it\nshould not be relied upon as a sole source of content, using it in conjunction\nwith other resources can help users quickly generate high-quality content.\n\n _Read our full_ _Articleforge AI writer review_ _._\n\n###  Best for long-form writing\n\n(Image credit: Jasper)\n\n### 4\\.

However, it may not be\nsuitable for everyone.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nCheck out our in-depth **AI-Writer review** to see if it's the solution for\nyou.\n\nAI-Writer is a word generator that is easily accessible and is popular among\nfreelancers and bloggers. It may not be as extensive as Anyword or CopyAI,\nwhich are primarily aimed at marketing and sales, but it serves its intended\naudience well.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of AI-Writer is its unparalleled\nsourcing capabilities. It is the only AI content generator that cites sources\nfor \"everything it writes.\" Additionally, it updates its sources frequently,\nensuring that any article generated by it sources the latest information on\nthe subject. This is a significant advantage, particularly for those who are\nwriting about current events or trending topics. With AI-Writer, writers can\ncreate content that is well-researched and accurate, without having to spend\nhours scouring the internet for sources.\n\nAnother significant advantage of AI-Writer is that it recognizes that not all\ntypes of content require sourcing. For instance, op-eds or personal essays\ndon't usually require sources. AI-Writer recognizes this and hides sources and\nlinks from the main results page, making it easier for writers to focus on\ntheir content and not worry about sources.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using AI-Writer is that its extensive sourcing process\ncan cause a minor delay in generating results compared to other AI writing\ntools. Although this may not be a significant issue, the noticeable delay\nshould be mentioned. For instance, alternative tools like GrammarlyGO offer\nresults without hesitation. However, it is worth noting that the issue with\nAI-Writer is primarily due to its thorough sourcing process.\n\nIn conclusion, AI-Writer is an excellent tool for freelancers and bloggers who\nwant to create high-quality content. It excels in sourcing capabilities,\nmaking it a go-to tool for writers who need well-researched and accurate\ncontent. Its ability to recognize when sourcing is not required is also an\nadded advantage. While it may not be the fastest tool on the market, its\nthorough sourcing process is worth the wait.\n\n _Read our full  _ _AI-Writer review_ _._\n\n* * *\n\n(Image credit: INK)\n\n* * *\n\n### TechRadar's AI writer rankings\n\nNumerous AI writing solutions are already available in the market, and we can\nexpect more to arrive in the future.

From data-driven, high-value pieces to conversion-focused\ncontent perfect for marketing campaigns, AI writers can easily create just\nabout any content.\n\nAs AI writing assistants gain exposure to various forms of real-world\ninformation, they gain proficiency in generating natural-sounding output. With\ntheir data coming from human sources, the output created also has a human-like\nquality. Much like how humans rely on existing content to craft something new,\nAI content tools scour the web for relevant data to fulfill the user's\ninstructions, thus creating original content.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, explains what AI writing is and how it functions.\n\n### How to choose the best AI writer for you?\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way. Whichever platform you choose, you will have to\ndo some editing, if you want to create useful texts.\n\nHere are some of the factors you should consider when choosing the right tool\nfor you:\n\n1\\. Ease of use\n\nTools that don\u2019t require technical knowledge or prior experience should be on\nthe top of your list. Investment in good UI means that other aspects of the\ntool are also likely to be of a higher quality.\n\n2\\. Price\n\nWhile this may not be popular with everyone, the price should play a major\nrole in deciding which tool to go for. Some are simply overpriced while not\noffering much more than their lower-priced competition. Pay attention to the\namount of content each price plan offers.\n\n3\\. High-quality output\n\nDespite the fact that, in the end, you will be editing the texts and images\nthe tool creates, having a tool that creates high-quality content will mean\nless time spent on fixing mistakes and editing.\n\n4\\. Integrations\n\nIf you\u2019re running a blog or business and have been doing so for some time, you\nprobably have your set of tools that you use for writing content. Making sure\nthat the new AI platform syncs well with your existing toolbox can be\nessential for how long and how well you utilize the AI tool.\n\nThe list above is not exhaustive, but does offer a great starting point in\nyour quest to find the best AI writing tool for your needs.\n\n## The best AI writers: How we test\n\nDuring our assessment, we\u2019ve evaluated various aspects such as the number of\nwriting templates, categories, recipes, number of languages supported, grammar\ncheckers, etc. Our goal was to create an extensive list of AI writing\nassistants that offer much more than simple rewording features.\n\nWe tested the overall capabilities of the AI software, the tool's interface\nand ease of use, monthly article limits, SEO optimization features, and\npricing, among other aspects.\n\nIn addition, we gave each platform a test article to write for us (a simple\ntopic) and checked its sentence structure and content relevance.\n\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\n\nRound up of today's best deals\n\nGrammarly Premium Annual\n\n$11.66\n\n/mth\n\nView\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\npowered by\n\n## Are you a pro?
