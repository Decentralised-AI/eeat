On average,\nusing RightBlogger\u2019s Article Tool in my own AI writing process has reduced my\ntime investment in long-form content from about ~8 hours to ~2.25 hours per\narticle. _This means I now publish blog posts more than 3x faster than I used\nto_.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of my _old_ content creation process compared to my new\nAI-assisted blogging process:\n\n_This AI article writer helps me publish blog posts more than 3x faster than\nbefore._\n\nAside from waving goodbye to writer\u2019s block while staring at a blank page\nforever, here are some of the highlights of what\u2019s changed in my own content\ncreation process with the addition of AI writing tools:\n\n  * Less time spent researching topics ahead of time (now more on the editing end though)\n  * No time spent on outlining (RightBlogger\u2019s Article Tool generates fantastic outlines)\n  * Very little time spent writing full sections of an article myself\n  * About twice as much time spent editing, adding voice, tone, and style as before\n  * _Important:_ Fact checking is incredibly important with AI content generators\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that AI article writers aren\u2019t going to reliably do\nall the work for us. Make sure you\u2019re always fact checking your AI generated\ncontent during your editing process (because AI can and often does make\nfactual errors & mistakes). You\u2019ll also want to invest more time into adding\n_your_ voice, tone and style into your content\u2014otherwise, it\u2019ll read as pretty\nbland in most cases.\n\n## How to Use this Free AI Writer (Article Generator Tool)\n\nIn case you\u2019re not as experienced (yet) with getting the most out of AI\nwriting tools, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to using this free AI article\nwriter to make sure you\u2019re generating content that\u2019ll meet your quality needs\nand satisfy search engines at the same time.\n\n### 1\\.

This is your opportunity to\ninject your own creative direction into the AI content generator with very\nclear suggestions around how it should write the article.

Select the Length of Your AI Article (Long-Form vs Short-Form) and\nPoint of View\n\nWith the free version of my AI article writer here, you\u2019ll be limited to\ngenerating (high-quality and SEO-optimized) short-form articles from this tool\nthat range from 500 to 1,000 words in length.\n\nInside RightBlogger, however, you\u2019ll have the option to generate long-form\narticles that can range from 1,000 to 3,000+ words depending upon how\nextensive your article\u2019s outline is:\n\n_Inside RightBlogger, you have options for setting article length and the AI\nwriting point of view._\n\nYou\u2019ll also have the option to select which point of view for the article to\nbe written from, choosing from these options:\n\n  * Automatic\n  * First Person (I)\n  * First Person Plural (We)\n  * Second Person (You)\n  * Third Person (They)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set all your options, you\u2019re ready to generate your AI article.\n\n### 5\\. Click \u201cGenerate\u201d to Get an SEO-Optimized AI Blog Article in Seconds\n\nThe moment of truth!

Depending upon the complexity of\nthe topic you\u2019re writing about, the AI writing process can take anywhere from\n30 to 90 seconds (a little over a minute is average for long-form articles\ninside RightBlogger).

AI writing is _not_ perfect on its\nown, it still needs your touch.\n\n### 6\\. Copy (or Download) Your AI Article & Get to Editing\n\nLastly, you\u2019ll need to hit the \u201cCopy\u201d or \u201c.docx\u201d button to grab your AI-\ngenerated content.\n\nThis is important, because this is a free AI article writer tool\u2014you won\u2019t be\nable save this article in an account, so if you navigate away from the page\nbefore saving your content locally, it\u2019ll disappear. Inside RightBlogger, we\nsave all of your AI-generated content to refer back to, edit, repurpose &\nshare with others.

Once you\u2019ve downloaded your article in a Word Doc, you can take to editing right there\u2014or move this properly formatted content into a CMS and get to work.\n\nNow, you\u2019re free to jump into editing & fact checking mode. You\u2019ll most likely\nwant to take a heavy hand to re-crafting an intro & conclusion that better\nsuits your voice, tone & style, as AI writing tools won\u2019t be able to capture\nyour true essence very well. Much of the body content in your article will be\nsturdy as-is, just keep an eye out for double checking any facts and figures.\n\nIf you\u2019re digging this AI writer and want to take your content creation to the\nnext level, come check out the 40+ AI tools we have inside RightBlogger\u2014where\nyou\u2019ll also be able to save all your AI-generated content in a single private\nlibrary.\n\n\u2728 Get **60+** Powerful Blogging Tools\n\nTry RightBlogger today and unlock unlimited access to AI blogging tools\nthat\u2019ll help you create great content, faster.\n\nTry RightBlogger\n\n## The Fundamentals of AI Writing (Using AI Content Generators for\nCopywriting, Blogging, Content Marketing & More)\n\n\u201c _With great power, comes great responsibility.\u201d_ \u2014 Uncle Ben advising the\nyoung Peter Parker (Spider-Man). This adage holds true when it comes to AI\nwriting too.\n\nThese tools are truly revolutionary. They\u2019re very quickly upending the way\nbloggers, content marketers, copywriters have functioned for years. While that\namount of change can sound scary to some, this is actually an incredible\nopportunity to redefine how you function in your business. **AI isn\u2019t taking\nyour job, it\u2019s creating new opportunities for you to grow and evolve.**\n\nHow often do we experience entire industries changing at light speed (like the\nway AI tools are shifting the world of digital content)? Now\u2019s the time to\nembrace using these AI tools to grow your business in new ways. Now, let\u2019s\ntalk about how to successfully use AI content generators in your writing\nworkflow.\n\n### 1\\. AI Article Writers are Tools (Not a Replacement for _You_ )\n\nYour new superpower is that you\u2019re a Certified Human\u2122\ufe0f with a deep well of\nemotional intelligence, heart, soul, feelings, real life experiences,\nexamples, and use cases you can use to make the first draft content you\u2019ll\ngenerate from AI writers, uniquely special & truly yours.\n\nWhile AI article writers can undoubtedly help generate content quickly, it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that they shouldn\u2019t replace your own human expertise\u2014the\nreason you decided to start a blog, pick up writing or launch your business,\nin the first place. These are _tools_ to help you write more content, faster\u2026\nnot completely remove you from your writing workflow (that would be a bad\nidea).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the combination of AI-powered tools and your unique-to-you human\nknowledge can create some of the absolute best, high-quality content that\u2019ll\nresonate with your audience and save you tons of time.\n\n### 2\\. Generate High-Quality Article First Drafts\n\nThink about using AI writing tools to gather ideas, inspiration and to\ngenerate first drafts of your content. I\u2019ll say it again, an AI article writer\nis not a replacement for doing the actual work of bringing forth _your_ unique\ntake on a subject. You\u2019re just changing the order of things in your content\ncreation process a bit\u2014so you\u2019ll now need to inject your humanity into your\narticle _after_ the first draft is generated.\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably noticed that AI-generated content can often sound\npretty bland or devoid of any discernible tone. This is particularly clear\nwhen seeing how AI writes intros and conclusions. That\u2019s because these AI\nalgorithms are learning from damn near everything on the Internet, of course\nit\u2019s not going to get _your_ tone just right.\n\nIt\u2019s _always_ going to be your responsibility to take AI-generated content and\nmake it your version of human, by adding your own expertise, voice, tone,\nstyle and examples to make your articles truly unique & engaging for readers.\n**Your ability to do this well at scale with the help of AI writing tools, is\nthe new superpower when it comes to blogging & content marketing.**\n\n### 3\\. You\u2019ll Become More of an Editor-First When Using an AI Writer\n\nLet me alleviate your existential concerns\u2026 you\u2019re still a writer, even if you\nuse AI writing tools to help with your content creation process. There\u2019s no\nworld in which generating an article with AI and instantly pressing publish\nwill pay off in the long run. Your AI-generated content still needs _you_ in\norder to be useful, relatable and actionable for your audience.\n\nEvery article you write with the assistance of AI, is still uniquely yours.\nYou\u2019ll be adding to the content, removing bits, editing sentences,\nrestructuring the flow, and injecting your humanity into the content with\nvoice, tone, style, examples and expertise.\n\nThose are all very much still the set of actions a writer (or blogger) takes.\nThe biggest change in your writing workflow now, will be getting a solid first\ndraft created by AI\u2014now you have a strong piece of long-form content to work\nwith, edit and massage into being a truly great article (in less time than it\nwould\u2019ve taken you to write that same article from scratch, yourself).\n\nNaturally, AI article writers are best-suited for certain types of jobs. If\nyou want to share a deeply personal story, a hot take on something going on in\nyour industry, or an insight that\u2019s so uniquely your own\u2026 AI writers won\u2019t be\nable to capture the pure essence of that, for you. With content like this, I\nrecommend still writing at least most of it yourself and seeing if there are\nany opportunities where AI tools can supplement creating smaller pieces of\nthat content.\n\n### 4\\. Take Extra Care with SEO-Optimizing & Fact-Checking Your AI Content\n\nWhile we\u2019ve built this AI article writer to generate SEO-friendly long-form\ncontent, it\u2019s not perfect. It never will be. You\u2019ll instantly get content that\nincludes relevant keywords and phrases, but it\u2019s important _not_ to rely\nsolely on AI-generated content for SEO success. Use AI-generated content as a\nstarting point, then use the best SEO tools out there to optimize your content\nfurther with human knowledge and expertise. Always keep an eye on fact-\nchecking for errors or mistakes AI tools may inadvertently make during the\nwriting workflow.\n\nBy finding a balance of combining these powerful AI tools with your human\nexpertise, you\u2019ll make the most out of AI article writing tools when it comes\nto boosting your article output without sacrificing quality. Remember to\nalways review AI-generated content before publishing\u2014and use AI writing\nassistants as a tool in your chest, rather than a replacement for your human\nknowledge & creativity.\n\n## What are the Best Use Cases for Incorporating this AI Writer Tool into Your\nWorkflow?\n\nAs I said at the start, this will forever remain a free AI article writing\ntool (with some usage limits, since it costs us to keep this free). In effect,\nthis is the free plan for our paid AI tool suite, RightBlogger, so you\u2019ll need\nno credit card to use this free tool above.\n\nI strongly believe that once you experience AI writing for yourself, you\u2019ll\ninstantly see just how much these tools can improve your content workflows in\nterms of (1) speed and (2) consistency. Now, let\u2019s talk about some specific\nuse cases for this AI article generator.\n\nThis free AI article writer is best used for generating SEO (search engine\noptimization) friendly blog posts that are designed to rank high in organic\nGoogle search results. That said, here are a few of my favorite related use\ncases you can also use this AI writing tool for:\n\n  * Writing full, SEO-optimized blog articles (long-form content)\n  * Brainstorming for bloggers of all types to get full first drafts of content inspiration\n  * Generating content to fuel posts for your social media calendar (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook & more)\n  * Coming up with creative ad copy to use in product descriptions & landing pages\n  * Crafting wide range of content marketing efforts that can be fueled with a high quality article\n  * Putting together blog post templates and first drafts to share with your content team\n  * Marketing copy to use across your website and even email copy to use in email campaigns\n  * Write articles to pitch as guest posts on other sites to grow your blog\u2019s influence\n  * Transition to AI copywriting for faster creation of product pages\n  * Creating tedious listicles with the click of a button (vs hours of writing & rephrasing)\n  * Content writing of all formats that you wan to outsource to AI writers\n  * Generating multiple versions of articles for A/B testing and increasing conversions\n\nWhile these use cases & ideas may spark some more inspiration for you, there\u2019s\nno real limit on how you can use this AI-generated content\u2014so please go crazy\nand let me know how you\u2019re using this free tool! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n## Ditch Your Writer\u2019s Block for Good: How to Think About AI Text Generators\n_Today_\n\nGone are the days of spending countless hours painstakingly stuck in content\nwriting & copywriting mode. With the rise of artificial intelligence tools\nlike this article writer, you can now generate high-quality content almost\ninstantly.\n\nMore importantly, AI writing tools will _not_ replace humans anytime soon.\nWhile anything is possible in the distant future, even the best AI writing\nassistants are simply reformulating information they\u2019ve found across the\nInternet\u2014and repackaging it into a uniquely written blog article for you. AI\narticle writers function just like my paragraph rewriter tool, just less\nobviously behind-the-scenes. We\u2019ll talk more about how this tool works, later\non.\n\n**AI article writers are a low-cost form of outsourcing parts of your content\ncreation process.** Treat this free tool like an AI writing assistant that\ntakes your guidance and works on your behalf. In essence, you\u2019re outsourcing\nthe time-consuming tasks of researching, outlining and writing your articles\nwhen using a content writer tool like this.\n\nHowever, AI writing isn\u2019t a totally done-for-you solution. Where you\u2019ll save a\nton of time skipping the content writing yourself, you\u2019ll now need to\ncompensate by investing more time into editing, fact-checking and weaving your\nvoice, style & tone into the content to ensure it\u2019s accurate and uniquely\n_yours_.\n\n## Do AI Content Writers Plagiarize? How Do I Know My AI Article Will be\nPlagiarism-Free?\n\nTime to put on your debate cap. **Is AI content plagiarism? The short answer\nis no, because** **no original work is being directly copied.**\n\nThat said, there\u2019s still an ongoing public debate over whether AI-generated\ncontent _should_ be considered plagiarism. Some argue that because the content\nis not created directly by a human, it can\u2019t be considered original\ncontent\u2014and therefore must be plagiarized. On the other side of the aisle,\nmany argue that since AI algorithms are designed to create unique content,\nit\u2019s not technically plagiarism.\n\n_Here\u2019s where I stand:_ I don\u2019t feel AI-generated content constitutes\nplagiarism, because no original work itself is being copied. The language\nprocessing models that power these tools are gathering incomprehensible\namounts of information from across the Internet, to write the content you get\nwhen you generate an article above. AI writers don\u2019t copy any specific\nsources, they\u2019re always learning and uniquely explaining a topic each and\nevery time you use one. For that reason, we don\u2019t have a built-in plagiarism\nchecker in this article writer.\n\nDespite this ongoing debate, it\u2019s important for bloggers and content creators\nto use these AI writing tools responsibly when it comes to content marketing\nefforts. Always fact-check your AI-generated content, be transparent, and\nethical in your use of AI writing tools.\n\n## How Does this AI Article Writer Work Behind-the-Scenes? Advanced\nParaphrasing & Rewording\n\n**This free AI article writer tool is AI-powered and designed to give you SEO-\nfriendly, uniquely written blog content**. Put simply, this is a content\ngenerator tool that\u2019ll take your input instructions & quickly write long-form\ncontent. While this AI-generated content won\u2019t technically be in your own\nwords, you\u2019ll get high-quality content that\u2019s uniquely written\u2014free of\ngrammatical errors.\n\nWe built this online tool using GPT-3 & GPT-4 artificial intelligence\ntechnology from OpenAI\u2019s API (they also run ChatGPT), with a focus on prompts\nwe\u2019ve perfected to generate clever, SEO-friendly, long-form content to use on\nyour blog. GPT-3 is a natural language processing model. In short, this means\nthe underlying technology has what\u2019s called a neural network machine learning\nmodel, that takes input text (like your keyword and outline) then generates\nplagiarism-free content you can use to fuel your blog articles.\n\nThis content generator tool functions similarly to our paragraph rewriter that\nparaphrases content, as well as our blog title generator and free keyword\nresearch tool\u2014they\u2019re all trained to learn from the vast body of information\non the Internet, to spot patterns. We\u2019ve trained our AI article writer with\nthe goal of giving bloggers a faster content writing experience & helping your\nblog posts to rank higher in organic search engine results.\n\n## AI Writer FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions about AI Article Writing)\n\nI get a lot of questions about this AI article writer, so here are answers to\nthose most frequently asked questions.\n\n### Does this free AI article writer work with a companion WordPress plugin or\nhave a Chrome extension?\n\nNo, it does not. To (soon) unlock access to our WordPress plugin and Chrome\nextension that are in development, you\u2019ll need to be a paying customer of\nRightBlogger. For our simple pricing of just $29.99/mo, you\u2019ll get unlimited\nuse of _all_ our 40+ AI tools for bloggers\u2014including the unlimited AI Article\nWriter Tool inside the platform, which has even more customizable options and\nfunctionality.\n\n### How long does this AI writer take to write an article?\n\nDepending upon the complexity of the topic you\u2019re tasking the AI article tool\nto write about & the length of the outline you\u2019ve instructed it with, the AI\nwriting process can take anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds (a little over 1\nminute is average).\n\n### What kind of articles will AI write best?\n\nAI article writers are definitely best-suited for certain types of content\ncreation tasks. They\u2019re best at writing about well-established topics without\nthe need for including personal stories or examples (you\u2019ll have to add those\nin during your editing process).\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to share a personal story, a hot take, or a\ndeep insight that\u2019s unique to you\u2026 AI writing tools won\u2019t be able to capture\nthe true essence of that on your behalf. With this kind of content, I\nrecommend still writing at least most of it yourself and seeing if there are\nany smaller opportunities where AI tools can swing in to support.\n\nWhile this free AI writer isn\u2019t specifically designed to generate things like\ncopy for Facebook ads or social media posts in general (though there is a tool\nfor that inside RightBlogger), it can still generate a useful block of AI-\ngenerated text that\u2019ll help human writers hit the ground running with ad copy\ngeneration. Whether you\u2019re using this AI writer for product descriptions on\nyour eCommerce shop (Amazon store), or to simply find the right words to\nstreamline your blog content\u2014I know you\u2019ll love this tool.\n\n### What are the benefits of AI-generated articles?\n\nThe benefits of AI-generated articles are actually huge in number. For one,\nthey\u2019ll save content creators (like you) a significant amount of time and\neffort. With AI article writers, you can can generate high-quality articles in\na matter of minutes, rather than hours or days. I\u2019ve been able to produce\nexcellent long-form articles in more like 2.5 hours, compared to my previous\naverage closer to 8 hours. This means higher productivity _and_ increased\noutput.\n\nBelieve it or not, AI-generated articles can also improve the overall quality\nof content. With NLP (natural language processing) algorithms, machines can\nanalyze and understand human language, ensuring that the articles they produce\nare coherent, relevant, and engaging. This can lead to higher engagement and\nbetter reader retention on your blog too, ultimately resulting in increased\ntraffic and revenue for content creators.\n\nIn addition to the more time and quality-focused benefits, AI-generated\narticles can also be customized to fit specific needs and preferences. For\nexample, machines can produce articles on hyper-niche topics you may not have\nthe time to get to yourself, and quickly generate SEO-optimized content,\ncreating new opportunities to show up in more search engine results pages\n(SERPs). You can also tailor your AI articles to a specific audience, making\nthem more appealing and engaging to readers.\n\n### What are the pros and cons of using AI article writers?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pros of using an AI article writer in your content\ncreation process:\n\n  * **Saving Time** : AI article writers are great tools for content creators who want to generate articles quickly and efficiently. One of the biggest advantages of using an AI article writer, is that it saves time. You can create high-quality articles based on just a few quick instructions for the tools to work with.\n  * **Idea Generation** : Another advantage of using AI article writers, is that they can help you come up with new ideas for your content. Use my free blog idea generator tool for that. The AI algorithms at play behind-the-scenes will suggest topics and even generate titles for your articles. This can be especially helpful if you\u2019re struggling with writer\u2019s block, or coming up with new ideas for your content.\n  * **Improve Your Writing** : Believe it or not, AI article writers can also help you improve your writing skills. By analyzing _your_ content, an AI writing assistant can identify areas where you can improve and suggest changes to make your writing more engaging and effective.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not all sunshine and roses. Let\u2019s talk about some of the cons of\nusing AI writing tools:\n\n  * **Limitations** : Although AI article writers have many advantages, there are also some limitations\u2014most clearly, they may not be able to produce content that\u2019s unique enough or high-quality enough for your standards. While they\u2019re vastly improving in this department, they\u2019re also not great at capturing the tone and style of your unique voice, which can make your content feel generic and impersonal if you don\u2019t take time to weave your own voice into the content. AI writers can also struggle with more complex topics that require a deeper understanding of the subject matter, making it better to write yourself if you can provide more in-depth and nuanced content.\n  * **Concerns About Inaccuracies** : One of my biggest concerns about AI article writers, is that they can be (intentionally or inadvertently) used to create fake news or misleading content. It\u2019s important to ensure the content produced by any AI text generators you use, is accurate and as unbiased as possible.\n  * **Ethical Implications** : As this technology is so new to the world, there are also ethical implications to using AI in your content process. It\u2019s important to ensure that the use of AI writing tools is transparent, and that readers are aware the content has been generated (at least in part) by an AI algorithm.\n\n### Does this free AI writer use a plagiarism checker?\n\nNo, this free tool does not use a built-in plagiarism checker. However we do\nhave a plagiarism checker (coming soon) inside the full RightBlogger AI\ncontent creation platform, which serves the purpose of illustrating that AI\ncontent doesn\u2019t constitute plagiarism\u2014as it doesn\u2019t \u201ccopy\u201d from any specific\nsources. Rather, AI algorithms are learning from a vast database of almost\neverything on the Internet and synthesizing, paraphrasing, rewording and\nreformulating totally unique answers to your queries every time you generate\nan article. Inside RightBlogger, we have dedicated tools for everything from a\ntext summarizer to an expander & everything in between that\u2019ll help you create\nmore content, faster.\n\n_Tool built by my insanely talented friend,@sup_.\n\n##  From the Blog\n\n  * 57 Best Work From Home Jobs in 2024 (Top WFH Jobs You Can Do From Home)\n  * How to Get High Quality Backlinks for Your Website (12 Strategies)\n  * 13 Best Cheap Podcast Microphones (USB) for Under $100\n  * What is a Blog Link (Permalink)?
