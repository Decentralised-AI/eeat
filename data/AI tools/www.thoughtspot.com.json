in 2024\n\nby Ryan Mattison, Senior Director, Content & Communications\n\nPublished Sep 19, 2023, last updated Jan 9, 2024\n\nIn today's fast-paced and ever-evolving business landscape, staying ahead of\nthe competition has never been more crucial. Often, that comes down to how\nefficient you can make every aspect of your business.\n\nThe biggest efficiency opportunity for businesses this year: Generative AI.\nAfter years of innovation, speculation, and conversation, AI took the leap\nthis year to go mainstream, quickly going from science experiment to an\nessential part of business user\u2019s workflows, improving process efficiency and\nrevolutionizing how teams measure success.\n\nAccording to _Gartner_, the global artificial intelligence market size is\nprojected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023\nto 2030. This growth trajectory indicates that the market is poised to reach a\nstaggering $1,811.8 billion by 2030.\n\nAs the AI market explodes, new tools and capabilities abound, promising to\nreimagine how we work. But which are truly up to the task? Here are ten AI\ntools poised to redefine success in 2024. These resources offer a wide array\nof capabilities, from leveraging machine learning algorithms for _data-driven\ndecision making_ to automating repetitive tasks. By harnessing the potential\nof these cutting-edge AI solutions, businesses can unlock new levels of\nproductivity, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nWhether you're an established enterprise or a budding startup, these game-\nchanging AI tools for businesses are shaping the future of business and\nredefining success in 2024. Here\u2019s our picks:\n\n  1. ThoughtSpot Sage\n  2. ChatGPT\n  3. Google Bard and Duet\n  4. Jasper\n  5. ChatSpot.ai by HubSpot\n  6. theGist\n  7. Fireflies.ai\n  8. Lavender.ai\n  9. Motion\n  10. Frase.io\n\n## 1\\. ThoughtSpot Sage:\n\nWe\u2019ll kick this list off with a shameless plug for our own Generative AI\noffering, _ThoughtSpot Sage_. Sage is built on top of ThoughtSpot's secure and\ngoverned search interface, allowing you to harness the power of large language\nmodels like GPT and Google PaLM for _self-service analytics_ at an enterprise\nscale. ThoughtSpot Sage also uses artificial intelligence to illuminate\nrelevant trends and patterns in your data and present them in an easily\nunderstandable format. That\u2019s right, telling a powerful _data story_ that\ndrives business outcomes just got a whole lot easier.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever waited hours (or days\u2026 or weeks!) for an answer to a data\nquestion, this one\u2019s for you. By empowering frontline business users to search\nand understand their business data using natural language, you can make\ninformed business decisions that translate to tangible value in your bottom\nline\u2014all without compromising confidence and security.\n\n### Core features:\n\n  * AI-powered, natural language search\n\n  * AI-generated answers\n\n  * AI-powered search suggestions\n\n  * Human in the loop feedback system\n\n  * AI-assisted data modeling\n\n **Searching for ways to plug AI into your Microsoft or** _ **Google\nWorkspace**_ **tools?** We\u2019ve got apps for that too.

ChatGPT:\n\nNow, onto the player who acted as a major catalyst to the AI craze way back in\n2022 (oh, how far we\u2019ve come in such a short time) and continues to be a major\ndisrupter today: _ChatGPT_. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a chatbot that\nenables users to leverage conversational AI to ask and answer questions.\n\nThis AI software for business is grounded on an advanced language model that\u2019s\nbeen trained on a diverse array of internet text, powered by innovations in\n_transformer architecture_. The latest model, _GPT-4_ is more advanced than\nprevious versions. However, all versions of ChatGPT deliver response\nhallucinations and introduce security risks. To mitigate these risks, you\nshould ensure your teams have defined use cases for when it is safe to utilize\nany version of the service for business purposes.\n\n### Core features:\n\n  * Natural language understanding\n\n  * Contextual responses\n\n  * Multi-lingual support\n\n  * Knowledge base integration\n\n  * Instructional response customization\n\n## 3\\. Google Bard and Duet:\n\nGoogle has been a long-time, major contributor in the AI race, building a\ncompany synonymous with search. As the AI market heated up, they announced\ntheir own conversational-AI chatbot, _Google Bard_, in February 2023. Since\nthen, Google Bard has been updated with Google's latest and most sophisticated\nlarge language model, PaLM 2.\n\nYou cannot use Google Bard in cloud apps like Sheets, and that\u2019s where Duet\ncomes into the picture. Google Cloud's Duet AI serves as a constant AI\npartner, offering assistance to users across all skill levels exactly where\nit's required. These AI services make cloud platforms across the Google\nworkplace more human-centric, holistic, and helpful.\n\n### Core features:\n\n  * Uses the most sophisticated LLM, PaLM 2\n\n  * Interactive voice assistant\n\n  * Synchronization with other Google products\n\n  * Export code to more places\n\n  * Intelligent document summarization\n\n## 4\\. Jasper:\n\nI may be biased as someone who spends a lot of time creating content, but\nanother AI tool for businesses that should be on your radar is _Jasper_.\nJasper is designed to seamlessly aid content creators, marketers, and\nbusinesses in generating top-notch content using AI. You can utilize Jasper to\ncraft a diverse set of content types\u2014such as blog articles, product summaries,\npromotional text, and emails.\n\nWhat I like the most about Jasper is its brand voice capability. It enables\nusers to incorporate their distinct brand voice into the AI-generated content.\nThis feature helps ensure alignment between the company's brand identity,\ntone, and style across all Jasper-produced content.\n\n### Core features:\n\n  * Engaging content creation\n\n  * Tailored AI for your brand voice\n\n  * Real-time information retrieval\n\n  * Integrate AI directly into your workflow\n\n  * Secure, scalable, and customizable writing assistant \n\n## 5\\.
