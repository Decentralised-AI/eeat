Best practices on\nthe use of AI in human subjects research are not yet well formed, nor is there\ngeneral consensus on appropriate use. Given this fluidity, this guidance is\ntherefore subject to change based on the development of this novel technology\nand best practices for its use. This guidance covers the use of AI, machine\nlearning, deep learning, and related AI techniques used in research\nactivities, as well as other activities that may govern or affect the use of\nAI tools within the context of research.\n\n  2. **AI Use in Human Subjects Research**\n\nWhen conducting research, a researcher may engage an AI tool in human subjects\nresearch when:\n\n  * The AI tool collects data from humans through interaction or intervention;\n  * The AI tool is used to obtain informed consent from human participants;\n  * The AI tool is used to obtain, analyze, or otherwise access identifiable data about human research participants; or\n  * The AI tool acts as an extension or representative of the investigator(s) by answering questions for potential, current, or past human research participants.\n\nThe Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) considers AI tools providing\ntranscription services to be integral to human research. Zoom\u2019s transcription\nservice has been reviewed for privacy, confidentiality, and security by UT\u2019s\nOffice of Information Technology (OIT) and, unless noted during Institutional\nReview Board (IRB) review, is not subject to limitations on transcription that\nare set forth in this guidance.\n\nThe data to which other AI tools have access should be carefully protected.\nUnless clearly stated otherwise by the terms of use of the AI tool provider,\nthere is no guarantee that the information provided to the AI tools will\nremain confidential. Investigators should therefore exercise caution and avoid\nsharing any sensitive or private information when using these tools,\nespecially data that is legally protected. More broadly, the UT HRPP\nrecommends the collection of identifiable participant data be limited to the\nminimum necessary for completion of the research activity, whether used with\nan AI tool or not.\n\n  3. **IRB Review**\n\nWhenever an AI tool is used to interact with or obtain data generated by or\nfrom human research participants, that AI tool is considered engaged in human\nsubjects research and the IRB will review the use of the AI tool in accordance\nwith the applicable ethical and regulatory standards.\n\nWhen research involves the use of an AI tool as described in this document,\nthe HRPP and IRB will follow procedures and Standard Operating Procedures\n(SOPs) related to the review of the overall study, including relevant\nindications in this guidance. This includes the use of certain exemption\ncategories, expedited review procedures, and full board review. When\nnecessary, the IRB will obtain review from outside parties (e.g., consultants)\nsimilar to ancillary reviewers and ancillary review committees employed for\nbiomedical research (e.g., radiation safety and biosafety committees).\n\nFor all research, the HRPP and IRB will review the use of the AI tool in the\nsame context as any other research mechanism. The IRB will review studies that\nuse AI tools under the same criteria for approval used for all other research.\nFor example, non-exempt research that uses AI tools will consider risk\nminimization, data safety monitoring, informed consent, equitable selection of\nsubjects, and the adequate protection of vulnerable populations. As with many\nother contextual issues in a given individual research protocol, the use of\nthe AI tool is subject to the relevant criteria for approval and, as such,\ntemplate protocols for AI research will not be made available by the HRPP.\n\n  4. **Informed Consent**\n\nThe HRPP recommends and, in many cases, will require that investigators notify\nparticipants of the use and context of AI in all consent documents, so that\nparticipants may make their own determination as to whether they wish to\nparticipate in the research. Investigators and consent documents should\nexplain in lay terms the AI\u2019s use in the study in relationship to the points\nlisted in section 2 of this guidance document, including the data to which it\nwill have access. This explanation should include what, if any, limitations\nwill be placed on the AI tool and participants, as well as a description of\nwhat the AI tool will do with any data that it receives as a result of the\nresearch activities. The IRB recognizes that investigators may not fully know\nor understand the scope of the AI tool\u2019s ability to utilize or re-access data\nthat it has been previously provided and, in those cases, the IRB will require\nthat investigators inform potential participants of this information.\nSimilarly, investigators must inform participants in the informed consent if\nand when their data cannot be removed from the AI tool.\n\nThe IRB does not permit AI tools to obtain automatic informed consent from\nparticipants; that is, a human investigator who is listed on the study and has\ncompleted all relevant training(s) must be present. As with all consent\nprocesses, it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure\nthat the appropriate staff are in place and that participants adequately\nunderstand the study in order to provide ongoing and meaningful informed\nconsent. The UT IRB will continue to approve electronic consent processes\n(e.g., the use of Qualtrics to obtain informed consent) so long as the consent\nprocess aligns with applicable regulations and requirements, including those\noutlined in this guidance.\n\nAI tools should not have access to informed consent documents, especially when\nan individual declines to consent in some or part of the research. In\nsituations where informed consent is obtained without an investigator\u2019s direct\ninteraction with participants (e.g., survey research employing Qualtrics to\nobtain informed consent), researchers should have mechanisms in place to\nensure consent is obtained from participants and that consent documents are\nseparated from any research data being provided to the AI tool.\n\nThe IRB will review requests for a waiver of consent as described in the\nfederal regulations or in relationship to an exempt protocol on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\n###  **5\\. Examples of Informed Consent AI Tools**\n\n**Situation 1:**   An investigator intends to collect informed consent for\nsurvey research by using a consent form posted on Qualtrics.\n\n**IRB Response:**   In this situation, the IRB will approve the use of\nQualtrics to deliver the informed consent. The IRB considers electronic\nplatforms that are not connected to an AI tool to be appropriate mechanisms to\nobtain informed consent. The IRB will continue to consider, as appropriate,\nprivacy and confidentiality as it relates to the study.\n\n**Situation 2:**   An investigator uses ChatGPT to create a consent form. The\ninvestigator intends to print the consent form and obtain signatures in-\nperson.\n\n**IRB Response:**   The IRB can approve these procedures, so long as the\nconsent form meets the regulatory or ethical requirements of informed consent\nand the signed consent forms are not provided to the AI tool.\n\n**Situation 3:**   An investigator intends to conduct a study on student\ninteractions with an AI chatbot. The study will take place remotely and the AI\nchatbot obtains informed consent directly prior to beginning the study\ninteractions.\n\n**IRB Response:**   The IRB will require changes to the study procedures for\nthe informed consent process. To ensure that informed consent is effective and\nongoing, investigators must have a mechanism to be actively engaged in the\ninformed consent process. Additionally, the IRB will request information about\nthe oversight and monitoring of the interaction with the chatbot.\n\n**Situation 4:**   An investigator wishes to conduct survey research.\nParticipants will input their data into a survey tool that will conduct real-\ntime analysis for the investigator. Informed consent will be obtained using\nRedCap and, subsequently, those that agree to participate will be redirected\nto the survey platform.\n\n**IRB Response:**   The IRB can approve this consent process if the completed\nconsent forms are not shared with the AI tool. Similar to Situation 1, the\nconsent process occurs separately from the AI tool.\n\n**Situation 5:   **An investigator conducting interview research intends to\nuse otter.ai for transcription services. The investigator will obtain verbal\nconsent prior to the interview and plans to record the consent. The\ninvestigator plans to provide otter.ai with all recordings for transcription.\n\n**IRB Response:**  The IRB will require changes to the consent procedures.\nConsent information should be kept separately from AI tools, especially when a\nparticipant does not consent to the research.\n\n  6. **Identifiable Data**\n\nInvestigators should be increasingly aware of and cautious of an AI tool\u2019s\nability to create indirect identifiers within a dataset. The HRPP recommends\nthat investigators, to the extent allowed within their research, limit an AI\ntool\u2019s access to demographic information and other data points that could\npotentially reidentify an individual (e.g., combinations of data points that\ncould identify an individual). The HRPP recommends and, in certain situations,\nwill require that investigators place limitations and parameters on the AI\ntool\u2019s data use, and submit documentation thereof.\n\n  7. **Bias**\n\nResearch has shown that AI tools can reflect or propagate biases based on a\nnumber of factors, including data used to train and operate the AI tool. The\nHRPP recommends that investigators develop and submit plans to routinely and\ncontinuously evaluate AI tools used in their protocols for bias. Such testing\nmay include, but is not limited to, creating test cases or replication tests.\n\n  8. **Limitations**\n\nRegardless of the level of review (e.g., exempt, expedited, full board)\napplied to a study, the HRPP has determined that:\n\nThe AI tool may not have access to the following data in identifiable format,\nincluding the combination of indirect identifiers that could reasonably\nidentify a participant:\n\n  * Biospecimens, including blood samples;\n  * Genomic data;\n  * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)-protected data; or\n  * Data that could reasonably put participants at risk: \n    * Example: Audio/video recordings about sensitive or illegal topics.\n\n** **\n\n  9. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-Protected Data**\n\nThe IRB will consider, on a case-by-case basis, permitting AI tools to have\naccess to identifiable health record data, provided the express consent of\nparticipants has been given, including the relevant HIPAA Authorization Forms.\nIn addition to all relevant information required by HIPAA, the HIPAA\nAuthorization Forms must disclose the use of the AI tool in an equivalent\nmanner as the informed consent document (see above).\n\nThe HRPP will not approve research with AI tools that have been given access\ndirectly to an electronic health record (\u201cEHR\u201d) system within the UT system.\nRather, UT researchers must curate data to remove the 18 identifiers prior to\nproviding it to the AI tool.  In cases where another institution has provided\nthe AI tool with access to its EHR, the HRPP will require written\ndocumentation of approval of access from the owner or administrator of the\nEHR.\n\n  10. **Data Scraping**\n\n**                **The use of AI tools to scrape data from websites is\nbecoming highly popular. The HRPP may approve these techniques in the context\nof human subjects research provided the overall research meets the applicable\ncriteria for approval. Investigators will be required to submit the\nappropriate limitations and parameters placed on the AI tool as part of their\nresearch proposal.\n\n  11. **Interventions**\n\n**                **In certain cases, AI tools may be used to engage in\nintervention-based research with participants. Such interactions between AI\ntools and participants are approvable, provided the research meets the\ncriteria for approval applied by the IRB. As part of the submission to the\nIRB, investigators must submit the following:\n\n  * A full description of the planned interaction between the participant and the AI tool;\n  * A description of the data that the AI tool will be designed to collect;\n  * Documentation of the parameters or limits placed on the AI tool for the intervention, data collection, and (if applicable) data analysis;\n  * Scripts or texts of instructions that will be read or provided to participants as part of the interaction with the AI tool; and\n  * A plan to monitor the safety of participants and their data during and after the intervention.\n\n**The HRPP strongly recommends and, in some cases, will require that\ninvestigators directly monitor any direct interaction between AI tools and\nparticipants.**\n\n  12. **Exemptions**\n\nThe HRPP has and will continue to review research that utilizes AI as exempt\nwhen the appropriate criteria are met. The exempt categories are available in\nSOP 5.2 and, for studies that use AI, all other portions of the exempt\ncriteria must be met, in addition to the limitations placed on the exemption\nby the HRPP.\n\n****\n\n### **Exempt Category 1**\n\n Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings,\nthat specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to\nadversely impact students\u2019 opportunity to learn required educational content\nor the assessment of educators who provide instruction.
