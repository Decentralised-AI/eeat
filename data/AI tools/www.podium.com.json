AI software\nfor business can also help improve customer engagement and analyze customer\nbehavior.\n\nFortunately, these capabilities show immediate results in any business. This\nmeans business owners, managers, and employees will benefit from a less\nstressful environment.\n\nFor example, Podium\u2019s AI-powered lead conversion platform offers web chat,\ntext marketing, online phone calls, and storage solutions. These features make\nit a breeze for companies to improve their online presence and stay in touch\nwith their customers. Moreover, they can integrate their existing tools with\nthe platform for an even broader AI solution.\n\n## What to Look For In an AI Tool for Business\n\nNow that your interest is piqued, you\u2019re likely wondering what type of AI\nassistant would work best for your business. Choosing the right AI tools for\nyour business relies on thorough research and a process of elimination. This\nmeans you must decide on your goals and use an AI tool that can help you\nachieve them. Consider the following factors when choosing AI software for\nyour business:\n\n### 1\\. Scalability\n\nRigid, inflexible AI tools make it nearly impossible to grow your business. It\nwould be best if you searched for AI software that expands as your brand does.\nThis means your AI solution should handle unexpected increases in workloads\neasily while functioning at the same level. It should also allow you to add or\nremove users without difficulty, and at a reasonable cost.\n\nTherefore, your chosen AI tools for business should remain manageable even\nwith an increasing number of users. They must retain their speed and usability\neven as you activate more features. The AI tool you choose must also be able\nto handle increasing amounts of customer data as your customer base grows.\n\n### 2\\. Integrations\n\nThe best AI tools for business operations include the option to integrate with\nvarious other software tools. The last thing you want to do is invest in AI\ntools you can\u2019t use in conjunction with other systems you\u2019ve come to rely on.\nYou must be able to integrate your communication systems, CRM, and other admin\nmanagement systems or databases with your AI software.\n\nMany AI-powered tools also come with API integration capabilities to\nfacilitate more efficient data exchange and enhance productivity.\n\n### 3\\. Data Security and Privacy\n\nAny AI software you use in your business must adhere to the required data\nsecurity features and privacy regulations. This is integral for protecting\nyour customers\u2019 sensitive information and keeping confidential business data\nout of the wrong hands. Using data-compliant software will also help you avoid\nincurring hefty penalties and fines.\n\n### 4\\. Learning Curve\n\nFurthermore, the best AI tools for small business processes are easy to\nunderstand and use. If you decide on AI software for your business, it must\nhave an intuitive and user-friendly interface. This will ensure that your team\nadapts quickly to the new system and gets the most use out of it without\nextensive (and expensive) training.\n\nAdditionally, the system must cater to all your business needs, including data\nanalysis, customer support, and sales optimization.\n\n### 5\\. Support\n\nAn AI assistant typically provides support to customers looking for various\nsolutions. In your business case, your AI assistant should include a reliable\nsupport system that allows your marketing and sales teams to troubleshoot\neffectively and with minimum downtime.\n\nWhat\u2019s great is that many AI-powered tools come with comprehensive user\nmanuals or documentation that you can count on. Self-service support options\nlike tutorials and knowledge bases can also help your teams quickly resolve\nissues with the tool.\n\n### 6\\. Pricing\n\nLastly, assess the overall cost of implementing and maintaining AI tools.\nConsider the calculated return on investment (ROI) and decide whether the\nbenefits of your AI system justify the expenses. If you\u2019ve chosen a system\nthat includes all of the above features, chances are you\u2019ll experience a\npositive ROI.\n\n## The 10 Best AI Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe best AI tools for small business operations include NLP (natural language\nprocessing) tools, RPA (robotic process automation), chatbots, predictive\nanalytics, and machine learning platforms. When choosing an AI tool for your\nsmall business, consider which features would benefit you the most. Some of\nthe best options when it comes to AI software for business include the\nfollowing:\n\n### 1\\. Podium\n\nPodium\u2019s AI-powered lead generation and conversion platform helps businesses\nmanage day-to-day operations effectively, drive growth, and win against the\ncompetition. The platform offers a variety of AI solutions across Webchat,\ntext, phone, and more.\n\nMoreover, with Podium, you can use one of several text message templates to\nsend an instant marketing campaign directly to your target market. Podium\u2019s\nbest features also include an AI response generator that can help you respond\nquickly to reviews and messages, which helps reduce customer churn. The\nsoftware also offers the option to send out customer surveys.\n\n### 2\\. ChatGPT\n\nLaunched by OpenAI, ChatGPT offers several advantages as one of the best AI\ntools for business. This generative AI technology can help you enhance your\ncustomer support, streamline your business operations, and provide you with\ndata insights. ChatGPT can also help you design and create personalized\ncustomer experiences. It does this by providing quick and accurate responses\nto queries and tailoring responses to individual preferences.\n\nChatGPT, also controversial to some, is great for automating repetitive tasks,\nwhich frees employees to focus on complex projects. The platform can help\ncreate content for business websites and social media and is adaptable across\nvarious business sectors.\n\nAs of this writing, there are some concerns with ChatGPT, as seen most clearly\nin the recent strikes that rocked the US. It is thought that the system will\nlead to large-scale job losses, especially for employees in charge of\nrepetitive processes.\n\nOn a smaller scale, some businesses are concerned that the data quality of\nChatGPT\u2019s output is not as high as it should be. GPT-3 is limited in its\nknowledge up to September 2021. However, there is a workaround for businesses.\nThere should be processes in place to validate the information provided by\nChatGPT to avoid errors.\n\n### 3\\. Google Bard\n\nBard is Google\u2019s answer to ChatGPT. One of the most popular AI-powered tools\ntoday, Bard is a powerful chatbot designed to simulate human conversations\nusing NLP and machine learning algorithms. Bard can help empower your business\nby streamlining your content creation process.\n\nBard can help you create anything from business blogs to social media images.\nIt is easy to use, accessible to anyone, and can answer queries and generate\ncontent on demand. Because Bard is grounded in Google\u2019s quality information\nfoundation, its language model doubles as a predictive engine. This allows it\nto provide relevant and appropriate responses.\n\nAs for cons, Bard is still in its experimental phase, so if you\u2019re already\nusing it, you may experience occasional inconsistencies. There are also\ninstances of a lack of creativity when compared with the responses provided by\nChatGPT. It is worth noting, however, that AI chatbots won\u2019t replace human\ncreativity but enhance it by inspiring writers. If used in that context, Bard\nbecomes an invaluable AI assistant.\n\n### 4\\. Crayon AI\n\nCrayon AI is a competitive intelligence platform that uses AI to help\nbusinesses gain insights into various markets. It zones in on areas like\nintelligent document analysis, algorithms, and market intelligence and works\nto optimize small business operations. This platform also assists business\nowners in data-driven decision-making to grow their brands.\n\nCrayon AI is one of the most valuable AI tools for business because it\nmonitors competitors in real-time. This means you\u2019ll always have up-to-date\ninformation to stay ahead in your market. The platform offers end-to-end AI\nsolutions to address specific business challenges and employs powerful\nalgorithms to maximize business processes.\n\nThe only problem with this is that if you over-rely on Crayon AI, you may\nexperience challenges if technical issues disrupt the platform. Also, the use\nof AI for competitive intelligence is not widely accepted. If you decide to\nuse this technology, you must ensure that your business complies with data\nprotection regulations.\n\n### 5\\. Otter.ai\n\nGood AI tools also include transcription software. Otter.ai is an AI-driven\nautomatic transcription service that records and transcribes voice\nconversations. This software offers several great features for businesses,\nincluding real-time transcription and automation. This web-based service uses\nAI to take notes during meetings and can even participate in them.\n\nThe goal of Otter.ai is to capture spoken words efficiently, which makes it an\nunmissable tool for any business that wants to communicate and document\nimportant information regularly.\n\nOtter.ai has a user-friendly interface, making the learning process quick and\nchallenge-free. It instantly converts spoken words into accurate text during\nbusiness meetings or team conversations. Furthermore, Otter.ai Chat is a real-\ntime AI assistant that participates in meetings by answering questions.\n\nThe software is available as a free version and comes in Pro and Business\nplans. However, it is essential to note that the set-up fee is not a visible\npart of these prices, so you must factor it into the overall spend.\n\n### 6\\. DALL\u00b7E 2\n\nDALL\u00b7E 2 is an advanced AI system that follows and builds on the capabilities\nof its predecessor, DALL\u00b7E. This AI tool will allow you to enter a written\nprompt and generate a relevant image. This means you can create visuals to use\nin your SEO efforts and marketing campaigns simply by prompting the software\nto do it. You can also create show-stopping website images to increase your\norganic traffic.\n\nThe 2.0 version of DALL\u00b7E creates higher-resolution images and understands\ntextual prompts better. It can also help you generate synthetic data, which is\nparticularly beneficial for areas such as gesture recognition.\n\nHowever, the software is not infallible, so there may be text understanding\nissues or difficulties translating prompts to exact images. The new model\noften struggles to produce AI-generated images related to subjects such as\nhuman faces or science.\n\n### 7\\. Bricabrac AI\n\nBricabrac is one of the most popular AI tools for business. It is designed to\nstreamline the process of creating web applications. As a business owner, it\nwill allow you to turn your ideas into functional applications, immediately\noptimizing your workflow.\n\nBecause Bricabrac works so quickly, it allows business owners and employees to\nsee their brainstorming efforts come to fruition. And, because it streamlines\nworkflows, it becomes easier for companies to implement the changes into their\nweb applications efficiently. Furthermore, Bricabrac AI can also potentially\ncontribute to a sales boost.\n\nBricabrac is not quite as user-friendly as other AI software for business.\nThis means companies may take longer to familiarize themselves with the tool.\nIt also relies heavily on AI algorithms, so if these don\u2019t work properly, it\nmay impact the tool\u2019s performance and functionality.\n\n### 8\\. Grammarly\n\nGrammarly is one of the most popular AI writing and editing tools today, with\nvarious features for small businesses. This AI assistant helps businesses\nenhance the quality of their written content by checking for grammar,\nspelling, punctuation, style errors, and plagiarism. It comes in free and\npremium versions, with additional features in the premium plans. This AI\nplatform is also available as an extension for Google Docs.\n\nAs a grammar checker and writing assistant, Grammarly has advanced\nproofreading capabilities that can help you improve your business documents,\ninternal communication, copy for website and landing pages, and social media\nposts. This will allow you to present professional writing on all platforms.\nThe business version also allows users to add industry-specific terms to a\ncustom dictionary. This furthers accurate proofreading.\n\nOne of the tool\u2019s advantages is that Grammarly supports remote teams. Using\nGrammarly will help your business maintain a consistent writing style if you\nhave writers working in different countries.\n\nHowever, the complexity and context of certain words and phrases may slip\nunderneath Grammarly\u2019s radar. It may also be necessary to update the custom\ndirectory continuously. And while Grammarly supports various languages and\nstyles, it may be stumped by language complexities or slang.\n\n### 9\\. Jasper.ai\n\nJasper.ai is another advanced AI writing tool designed to help marketing teams\nand content creators produce high-quality content. It uses machine learning\nand language processing technology to generate flawless marketing copy,\nincluding blog posts, product descriptions, ad copy, company bios, and social\nmedia content. Jasper.ai positions itself as a must-have AI assistant to\ndeliver the best outcomes for content marketing teams in small businesses.\n\nThe platform is well-known for generating content fast. It even claims to\ncurate content at least five times faster than the average human copywriter,\nwhich can save businesses a lot of time. It offers more than 50 content\ntemplates and unlimited AI image generation, which means you can use it for a\nrange of content creation needs. Jasper.ai is also a highly flexible AI tool,\nmaking it adaptable for content creation in different fields.\n\nThat said, Jasper.ai cannot imitate the nuances of human copy or content\nwriting. This means there may be an over-expectation, which may cause some\nbusiness owners to feel that the software under delivers.\n\n### 10\\. Eightify\n\nRounding out the list of best AI tools for small businesses is Eightify. This\nsoftware specializes in summarizing YouTube videos using ChatGPT technology.\nIt aims to save time by providing concise and useful summaries of long videos.\nIt also extracts the main ideas and most important information instantly.\n\nEightify is also available as a Chrome extension and allows users to access\nthree free summaries a week, for videos no longer than 30 minutes. In addition\nto persona video consumption applications, Eightify offers business services,\nin particular, online and entrepreneurship enterprises.\n\nEightify is exceptionally cost-effective and also offers an alternative to\nbusinesses in the social media marketing industry. With a paid plan, your\nbusiness can use Eightify to summarize an unlimited number of videos of any\nlength. This provides great flexibility if your brand has diverse content\nneeds.\n\nIt is essential to note, however, that Eightify currently works primarily with\nYouTube videos. If you have video content on other platforms, you may find\nthis AI tool\u2019s scope limited.\n\n## AI Tools for Business FAQS\n\n### Q: What are the best free AI tools?\n\nA: Some of the best free AI tools for business include ChatGPT 3.5, HIX.AI,\nJasper.ai, and Midjourney.
