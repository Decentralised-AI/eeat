I, for one, can't.\n\nI rely entirely on my Google Maps app. \ud83e\udd33\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it saves me time. Because it's always up to date with the latest\ntraffic jams and road works on the way. Because it has all this data and is\nsmart enough to make sense of it in seconds in order to help me solve my\nproblem, which is to reach my destination. Swiftly, smoothly, and without\nfriction.\n\nIt's a perfect example of AI being fully integrated into my daily life.\n\nAnd it's by far not the only one.\n\nAs we experience a boom in the field of AI, many new, interesting, and\nunforeseen applications are being developed every day. \ud83e\ude84\n\nThey range anywhere from business to deeply personal use cases, but the\nreasons why we use them are more or less the same:\n\n **AI has evolved to the point where it can assist humans with repetitive\ntasks, reduce human error, and thus save operational costs and resources.  **\n\nSo for the sake of this article (and my own curiosity), I delved into the\nbustling world of AI tools.\n\nSome I already knew.\n\nLike AI video generators, copywriting tools, or AI tools for generating art.\n\nOthers, I discovered anew. \ud83d\udc40\n\nI had no idea that AI can write code by itself, create Excel formulas based on\ntext input, and generate lifelong AI companions just like Spike Jonze\npredicted in Her, the film that was labelled as a _sci-fi_ romantic drama when\nit came out in 2013. Emphasis on _sci-fi_.\n\nSo without further ado, join me in exploring different artificial intelligence\ntools, and don't forget to write down the ones you'd like to try \u2014 the list is\nlong:\n\n##  **What are AI tools?**\n\nAI tools are software applications that utilize artificial intelligence to\nsolve specific problems.\n\nAnd by problems, I mean a broad range of tasks, such as generating text,\nanalyzing large datasets, or predicting the next big earthquake.\n\nAI tools have already transformed the way we use and interact with technology\n(think Siri, Google Maps, or smart Netflix algorithms), and this\ntransformation is only going to accelerate in the future.\n\nEspecially with the emergence of a new form of artificial intelligence, also\nknown as **generative artificial intelligence** , which can generate unique\ncontent that has never existed before, we are poised to witness numerous\nuseful applications across all sectors and industries.\n\nBut how do all these AI tools _actually_ work?\n\nIn short, their operation involves the use of machine learning algorithms to\nanalyze data and make decisions based on recognized patterns and current\ntrends. This ultimately leads to outcomes that are either similar to or better\nthan human performance.\n\n##  **7 benefits of AI tools**\n\nThere are numerous benefits to using AI tools, whether for personal or\nbusiness purposes.\n\nHowever, there's one simple promise underpinning all of them: **they are here\nto simplify our lives.** This can mean saving us time, eliminating tasks we\ndislike, reducing errors, or enhancing our creative abilities.\n\nAI-powered tools come in different forms, such as browser-based applications,\nextensions, or desktop/mobile apps.\n\nRegardless of their appearance, it's highly likely that you've chosen them\nbecause you recognize one or more of the following benefits they can bring to\nyour life:\n\n  1.  **They are always readily available, 24/7.  **No sleep, no paycheck, no sick leave.\n  2.  **They eliminate monotonous tasks.  **No more repetitive work; you can now focus on more important matters.\n  3.  **They are fast.  **They can perform tasks that would take you weeks... in minutes.\n  4.  **They are accurate.  **Humans make mistakes for various reasons - AI doesn't.\n  5.  **They help you think. Literally.** Need a partner for brainstorming different ideas? AI has your back.\n  6.  **They allow you to express yourself creatively.  **You no longer need technical skills to create music, videos, designs, or text.\n  7.  **They enrich your experiences.  **Better websites, improved apps, and more immersive video games \u2013 you got it.\n\nSo, now that you know the key benefits of AI tools, it\u2019s time to get to know\nthem better.\n\nReady?\n\n##  **152 best artificial intelligence tools of 2024**\n\nIn this article, we'll explore AI tools for various use cases.\n\nRegardless of your background or interests, I'm confident you'll discover\nintriguing ideas, use cases, or perhaps even an AI tool you'd like to share\nwith your friends (some of them are undeniably entertaining \ud83d\ude09).\n\nI've categorized them into sections to facilitate easy navigation, allowing\nyou to locate the ones that pique your interest.\n\n  * AI video generators and editors\n  * AI image and art generators and editors\n  * AI writing tools and text generators\n  * AI music generators\n  * AI face generators\n  * AI avatar generators\n  * AI painting and drawing tools\n  * AI audio generators\n  * AI design tools\n  * AI business tools\n  * AI research tools\n  * AI tools for everyday\n  * AI tools for students\n  * AI character generators\n  * AI for cinephiles\n  * AI for pets\n\nNow, you've likely at least skimmed through the aforementioned categories.

Not\nanymore! Today, with the help of generative AI, **anyone can become an artist\nby writing a text prompt and letting the AI create the desired image**. \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udd8c\n\nAre text-to-image technologies replacing artists? The answer is no. The thing\nis that AI-generated art opens up new, unprecedented possibilities for\ncreative expression while being accessible to all.\n\nAI image generators are evolving at a rapid pace; in the last year, major\ncompanies like Google, Open AI, and Stability AI have launched new models. The\ninternet has been flooded with AI-generated art, showing its great potential\nfor different aspects of content creation.\n\nBut artificial intelligence image generators don\u2019t just generate abstract and\nartistic content. The AI models are trained to also generate photorealistic\nimages that are indistinguishable from real photos.\n\nReady to start creating? Here\u2019s a list of the most notable text-to-image\ngenerators out there right now:\n\n### 17\\. DALL-E 2\n\nThe most recognizable of AI image generators out there is certainly DALL-E 2.\nThis text to image system by Open AI can create realistic images and art based\non text input. It\u2019s a kind of magic, really.\n\nYou simply write what you want it to create, and you get your image right\naway. An astronaut riding a horse, photorealistic style? A fox sitting in a\nfield in the style of Claude Monet? Yup, it\u2019s that smart. And the best thing \u2014\nanyone can play around with it.\n\n#### Dall-E pros\n\n  * It can generate images in a wide range of styles\n  * The generated images do not have a license, so you can use them freely\n  * Each text prompt generates a set of four images you can choose from\n\n#### Dall-E cons\n\n  * It sometimes struggles with generating photorealistic images\n  * It only works for prompts written in English, other languages are not supported\n\n#### Dall-E pricing\n\n  * $15 for 115 credits (each text prompt costs one credit, which equals $0.13 per prompt)\n\n### 18\\. Stable Diffusion\n\nSimilar to DALL-E 2 is Stable Diffusion. It\u2019s a text-to-image model that\ncreates images based on text descriptions. It can also be used to modify\nexisting images following text-based prompts. You can try out how it works on\ntheir website. No registration or credit card is required; you only need an\nidea and a few words to describe the desired result.\n\n#### Stable Diffusion pros\n\n  * It has a prompt database with 8 million prompts to help you write good prompts\n  * It also comes as a mobile app called Dreamer\n  * It can be used to enhance specific features in an existing image\n\n#### Stable Diffusion cons\n\n  * Complex pricing system\n  * The quality of the results may vary depending on the input data\n\n#### Stable Diffusion pricing\n\n  * Free plan\n  * Basic: $9/month for 999 image generations, no APIs\n  * Standard: $49/month for 999 image generations and access to all APIs\n  * Premium: $149/month for unlimited image generation and access to all APIs\n\n### 19\\. Midjourney\n\nAnother AI art generator is Midjourney. It\u2019s currently in beta, and anyone can\nstart using it via their Discord channel. The trial version is limited to 25\nqueries. It takes about 1 minute to generate 4 four options based on your text\nrequest.
