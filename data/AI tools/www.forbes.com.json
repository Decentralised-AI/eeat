Enjoy the Daily!\n\nMore Newsletters\n\nMost people will have first come across the term in science fiction, where,\nfor over 100 years, we\u2019ve been entertained by stories involving intelligent\nrobots \u2013 sometimes friendly, sometimes not so.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nPLAY Forbes Innovation 01:12 Video Settings Full Screen About Connatix V412657\nThis Latvian Scientist Says His Startup Is Winning The AIDrug Discovery Race\n\nIn reality, when we use the term AI today, we are usually referring to a\ntechnology known as \"machine learning.\" Rather than simulating every aspect of\nnatural intelligence like robots in movies, this simply refers to software\nalgorithms that are able to learn \u2013 becoming better and better at carrying out\none specific task as they are exposed to more data.\n\nMachine learning powers a large number of revolutionary tools that have\nchanged the way we live -from searching for information online with Google, to\nshopping with Amazon, watching movies on Netflix, or hailing a ride with Uber.\nNow the latest breed of AI applications offers us the chance to use it for\njust about any task we can think of. So, let\u2019s take a look at some of them:\n\n**What Are The \u201cKiller Apps\u201d Everyone Should Know about?**\n\n**ChatGPT**\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick recap of the viral sensation that is ChatGPT. It is a\nconversational interface for OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 large language model, which has\nrecently been made available to the public as a free research preview. In\nresponse to text prompts such as questions or instructions, it will output\ntext in any form, including prose, poetry, and even computer code.\n\n**Dall-E 2**\n\nAnother OpenAI project, which together with ChatGPT is responsible for kick-\nstarting the current wave of consumer interest in generative AI. This one\ntakes text prompts and transforms them into computer graphics (images, photos,\ndrawings, paintings, etc.).\n\n**Stable Diffusion 2**\n\nThis is another text-to-image generative AI application. Unlike Dall-E 2, its\nsource code, as well as details on the training data and weighting used by its\nalgorithms, are openly available to the public, and the application can be\ndownloaded and installed on your own computer rather than only being\naccessible through a proprietary cloud portal as is the case with OpenAI\u2019s\nprojects.\n\n**Lumen5**\n\nAn AI-powered video creation tool that enables anyone to easily create\neducation, marketing, or business video content using a simple drag-and-drop\ninterface.\n\n**Soundraw**\n\nAutomated music generator \u2013 create royalty-free AI music by simply making\ndecisions about the genre of music you want to create, the instruments that\nwill be used, the mood you want to create, and the length of the track. Then\nsit back and let the AI compose unique tracks.\n\n**Looka**\n\nThis is a tool that makes it easy to brand your business by using AI to create\nunique and distinctive logos that convey your company style and messaging.\nThis tool makes it a doddle to start creating customized marketing material\neven if you don\u2019t have any design skills.\n\n**Podcastle**\n\nAn audio recording and editing platform with integrated AI tools that helps\nyou create clear, super-smooth recordings that sound as if they\u2019ve been edited\nprofessionally, automating tasks like cleaning up messy sounds and creating\ntranscripts.\n\n**Gen-1**\n\nCloud-based text-to-video platform that creates new videos from ones that you\nupload, using text prompts to apply the edits and effects that you desire, or\ncreate animations from storyboard mock-ups. This tool was also developed by\nthe creators of Stable Diffusion.\n\n**Lalal.ai**\n\nThis tool uses a neural network system called Phoenix to automate audio source\nseparation. This involves extracting elements such as vocals, music, or even\nspecific instrumental tracks like drumbeats or basslines from any audio or\nvideo content.\n\n**Deep Nostalgia**\n\nDo you have historic family photographs of distant relatives or ancestors who\nyou\u2019d like to see in motion? This innovative tool lets you animate the faces\nin family photos so you can see them smile, blink, and laugh, just as if you\nhad recorded a video of them back in the day.\n\n**Murf**\n\nThis is a text-to-speech engine that makes it simple to create natural-\nsounding synthetic vocal recordings in 15 languages from a choice of over 100\nvoices and dialects. This output can easily be incorporated into automated\nmarketing or video content, automating the process of creating narration and\nvoiceovers.\n\n**Legal Robot**\n\nThis tool is designed to automatically translate complex and confusing\n\u201clegalese\u201d into straightforward language that can be understood by anyone.\nUseful both for laypeople wanting to make sure they understand legal documents\nand for legal professionals to ensure that their contracts and documents are\nwritten in terms that anyone can understand.\n\n**Cleanup.Pictures**\n\nThis AI tool lets you retouch images by removing unwanted objects, defects, or\neven people, using a process known as \u201cinpainting\u201d to help you create the\nperfect image.\n\n**Fireflies**\n\nThis tool plugs into popular video conferencing tools like Zoom, Teams, or\nWebex and automates the process of taking notes and creating transcriptions.\nIt also analyzes conversations to provide insights into the dynamics and\ndecision-making that are going on in your conversations.\n\n**Krisp**\n\nAnother conference calling application, this one uses algorithms to remove\nbackground noises, echo, and other distracting elements in real-time, ensuring\nthat you always come across in a clear and professional manner.\n\n  \n\nTo stay on top of the latest on new and emerging business and tech trends,\nmake sure to subscribe to my newsletter, follow me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and\nYouTube, and check out my books \u2018Future Skills: The 20 Skills And Competencies\nEveryone Needs To Succeed In A Digital World\u2019 and \u2018Business Trends in\nPractice, which won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
