This guide delves into the significance of AI tools and\nreviews 15 best AI marketing tools you can leverage to cut costs, speed up\nworkflows, improve efficiency, and find new creative solutions.  \n\n## What Is an AI Marketing Tool?\n\nAn AI marketing tool is a platform or software that utilizes artificial\nintelligence (AI) to automate, optimize, and enhance various marketing tasks\nand processes. Unlike traditional marketing tools, AI-powered solutions can\nprocess vast amounts of data, learn from patterns, and make predictions or\ndecisions without constant human intervention.\n\nThese tools can offer personalized recommendations, forecast marketing trends,\nautomate repetitive tasks, and provide insights from complex data sets, making\nmarketing efforts more efficient and effective.\n\n## Top AI Marketing Analytics Tools\n\nWhile many applaud AI for its role in generating stunning visuals and written\ncontent, a silent yet significant revolution is unfolding in the domain of AI\ndata analysis.\n\n### AI Assistant by Improvado\n\nImprovado AI Assistant is an AI-powered revenue analytics copilot. Improvado\nconnects to all your marketing and sales platforms, aggregates the data,\napplies transformations and prepares it for further analysis. Once the data is\nall clean and in your dataset, the Assistant connects to the database and\nmakes these piles of data actionable.\n\nPowered by AI and text-to-SQL technology, AI Assistant eliminates the barriers\nthat once stood between marketers and their data. You no longer need to know\nSQL or understand every nuance of your database structure. Instead, you can\ndirectly communicate with your data in plain English within the chat-like UI.\n\nWhether you're inquiring about ad spend, campaign performance, or budget\npacing, AI Assistant taps into your storage and provides clear, concise\nanswers. Upon finding the answer, you can continue communication with the\nAssistant on your findings and how to apply them to your strategy.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### AI Assistant Use Cases\n\n  *  **Ensuring alignment among all team members:** Dashboards often present data in an open-to-interpretation form. The same data point may be reported differently across different departments, which can lead to differing conclusions and conflicting decisions. AI Assistant analyzes the data and presents a precise answer, no matter how many times of who's asking the question. \n  *  **Cross-Channel Analytics** : Allows users to query ad spend across multiple platforms, evaluate the performance of campaigns based on ROAS, and analyze metrics like CPC and CTR for individual account names.\n  *  **Budget Pacing** : Enables comparison of ad spend for varied categories, assessing expenditure against the remaining budget for distinct timeframes, such as quarterly or annually.\n  *  **Data Exploration & QA**: Offers tools for examining table updates within specific periods, verifying data consistency, and determining dates when conversions on specific platforms met or surpassed predetermined thresholds.\n\n###  **Schedule a call to see how Improvado AI Assistant can speed up your\nmarketing analytics routines**\n\nBook a demo\n\n### ChatGPT Plugins for Data Analysis\n\nWith the integration of specialized plugins, ChatGPT has transformed from a\nmere text generator to a powerful tool that can surf the internet, automate\nworkflows, and visualize data. For marketers, this means a more streamlined\nand efficient approach to data analysis.\n\nFor instance, the Advanced data analysis, previously known as Code\nInterpreter, plugin seamlessly integrates the power of Python programming into\nthe ChatGPT environment, allowing marketing analysts to run, test, and debug\nPython code in real-time.\n\nIf you've just received a CSV file with the latest sales data, you can quickly\nload it into your chat, apply relevant Python libraries like pandas or\nMatplotlib, and start analyzing.\n\n> ChatGPT\u2019s \u2018code interpreter\u2019 is kinda wild. Watch it segment music markets\n> based on a spreadsheet and come up with business strategies for each\n> segment! pic.twitter.com/fpGzfvz2SL\n>\n> David Boyle (@beglen) April 30, 2023\n\nHere are some marketing analytics use cases:\n\n  *  **Audience Segmentation** : By inputting customer data, marketers can use the Code Interpreter to apply clustering algorithms or other statistical methods to segment their audience based on purchasing behavior, demographics, or engagement metrics.\n  *  **Campaign Performance Visualization** : After a marketing campaign, data like click-through rates, conversion rates, and customer engagement can be visualized using Python libraries like Matplotlib or seaborn, providing a visual representation of the campaign's success.\n  *  **A/B Testing Analysis** : For marketers running A/B tests on their website or ads, the Code Interpreter can be used to statistically determine which version performs better in terms of conversions, engagement, or any other metric.\n\nUnlock ChatGPT's potential in marketing with practical prompts and performance\nboosters.\n\nDownload\n\nTransform your marketing reporting process with AI: 5 steps to build a\ndashboard with ChatGPT.\n\nDownload\n\nLearn to leverage ChatGPT plugins for crafting insightful graphs and\ndashboards.\n\nDownload\n\n## AI Marketing Tools for Content Creation\n\nMost AI marketing tools for content creation leverage Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), AI that can read, understand, and derive meaning from human\nlanguages.
