In fact, we expect it from our tech products. No one wants\nto reconfigure their entire tech suite every time a new update is launched.

It makes projects run smoother, data cleaner and our\nlives easier. Around 37 percent of companies use AI to run their businesses,\naccording to the tech research firm Gartner. That number should only grow in\ncoming years, considering the number of companies using artificial\nintelligence jumped 270 percent from 2015 to 2019.\n\nAI is already a staple of the business world and helps thousands of companies\ncompete in today\u2019s evolving tech landscape.
