artificial intelligence tool that lets shoppers ask questions about a specific product.\n  * The feature could keep shoppers from scrolling through pages of reviews or reading through a listing to find information about an item.\n  * The company has been experimenting with AI to summarize reviews and to help sellers with tools such as AI-generated images for advertisements.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * AMZN\n\nFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nAmazon trailers are parked at an Amazon Air gateway at Miami International\nAirport in Miami, Florida, on Sept. 26, 2023.\n\nJoe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nAmazon is rolling out an artificial intelligence tool that can answer\nshoppers\u2019 questions about a product, a spokesperson confirmed, as the company\ncontinues to experiment with generative AI.\n\nThe new feature in Amazon\u2019s mobile app prompts users to ask questions about a\nspecific item. It then returns an answer within a few seconds, primarily by\nsummarizing information collected from product reviews and the listing itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly inventing to help make customers\u2019 lives better and easier,\nand are currently testing a new feature powered by generative AI to improve\nshopping on Amazon by helping customers get answers to commonly asked product\nquestions,\u201d Maria Boschetti, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email.\n\nThe feature could keep shoppers from scrolling through pages of reviews or\nreading through a listing to find information about a product.\n\nUnlike OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Amazon\u2019s new feature isn\u2019t equipped to carry out a\nconversation, but it can respond to creative prompts. On a listing for a\nwomen\u2019s vest, it could write a haiku about the product. It was also able to\ndescribe the item in the style of Yoda from Star Wars. The tool is designed\nnot to veer off subject, and will return an error message if it can\u2019t answer\nquestions such as, \u201cWho is Jeff Bezos?\u201d\n\nThe tool was first spotted by Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce research firm.\n\nAmazon has introduced several AI tools to its site in recent months. Last\nJune, the company started testing AI-generated summaries of product reviews,\nand it has launched AI features for third-party sellers that help them write\nlistings, as well as generate photos for ads. Elsewhere, it has rolled out\n\u201cQ,\u201d an AI chatbot for companies to assist with daily tasks, and Bedrock, a\ngenerative AI service for Amazon Web Services customers.\n\nIn Amazon\u2019s latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said the company is using\ngenerative AI to forecast inventory and to determine the best last-mile routes\nfor drivers.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is going to change every customer experience, and it\u2019s going to\nmake it much more accessible for everyday developers, and even business users,\nto use,\u201d Jassy told CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer last month. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s going to\nbe a lot of societal good.\u201d\n\n **WATCH:** Cramer interview with Andy Jassy\n\nVIDEO12:4712:47\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy: We think the FTC is \u2018wrong on the facts\u2019 in antitrust\nlawsuit\n\nMad Money with Jim Cramer\n\n _ **Don\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:**_\n\n  *  _Tesla versus BYD: Analysts prefer one of them \u2014 giving it up to over 70% upside_\n  *  _Goldman says small caps to beat large caps this year. 10 cheap smaller stocks to buy_\n  *  _DoubleLine\u2019s Gundlach sees \u2018very painful\u2019 economic downturn, S &P 500 may be forming \u2018double top\u2019_\n  *  _\u2018One of the best valuations for AI\u2019: Buy the dip in this Big Tech stock, strategist says_\n\nTV\n\nWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n\n  * CNBC Councils\n\n  * Select Personal Finance\n\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n\n  * Supply Chain Values\n\n  * Select Shopping\n\n  * Closed Captioning\n\n  * Digital Products\n\n  * News Releases\n\n  * Internships\n\n  * Corrections\n\n  * About CNBC\n\n  * Ad Choices\n\n  * Site Map\n\n  * Podcasts\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Help\n\n  * Contact\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n#### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

GPT-4 Turbo artificial intelligence model during its first in-person event on Monday.\n  * It revealed a new option that will let developers create custom versions of its viral ChatGPT chatbot.\n  * It\u2019s also cutting prices.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event on November 06,\n2023 in San Francisco, California. Altman delivered the keynote address at the\nfirst ever Open AI DevDay conference.\n\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nOpenAI announced its new, more powerful GPT-4 Turbo artificial intelligence\nmodel Monday during its first in-person event, and revealed a new option that\nwill let users create custom versions of its viral ChatGPT chatbot. It\u2019s also\ncutting prices on the fees that companies and developers pay to run its\nsoftware.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s announcements show that one of the hottest companies in tech is\nrapidly evolving its offerings in an effort to stay ahead of rivals like\nAnthropic, Google and Meta in the AI arms race **.** ChatGPT, which broke\nrecords as the fastest-growing consumer app in history months after its\nlaunch, now has about 100 million weekly active users, OpenAI said Monday.\nMore than 92% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform, up from 80% in\nAugust, and they span across industries like financial services, legal\napplications and education, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told reporters Monday.\n\nThe event also included a surprise appearance by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cThe systems that are needed as you aggressively push forward on your road map\nrequire us to be on the top of our game, and we intend fully to commit\nourselves fully to making sure you all... have not only the best systems for\ntraining and inference, but also the most compute,\u201d Nadella told OpenAI CEO\nSam Altman while onstage together. He added, \u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to\nmake progress.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft\u2019s expanded investment in OpenAI \u2014 an additional\n$10 billion \u2014 made it the biggest AI investment of the year, according to\nPitchBook, and in April, the startup reportedly closed a $300 million share\nsale at a valuation between $27 billion and $29 billion, with investments from\nfirms such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. As recently as last\nmonth, OpenAI was reportedly in talks to close a deal that would lead to an\n$80 billion valuation.\n\nIn his speech Monday, Altman said the day\u2019s announcements came from\nconversations with developers about their needs over the past year. And when\nit comes to GPT-5, Altman told reporters, \u201cWe want to do it, but we don\u2019t have\na timeline.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what OpenAI announced Monday:\n\n## GPT-4 Turbo\n\nZoom In IconArrows pointing outwards\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT\n\nGPT-4 Turbo is the latest AI model, and it now provides answers with context\nup to April 2023. Prior versions were cut off at January 2022. For example, if\nyou asked GPT-4 who won the Super Bowl in February 2022, it wouldn\u2019t have been\nable to tell you. GPT-4 Turbo can.\n\n\u201cWe are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT\u2019s knowledge\nabout the world ended in 2021,\u201d Altman said in a speech Monday.\n\nIt also accepts a lot more input. While earlier versions limited you to about\n3,000 words, the GPT-4 Turbo accepts inputs of up to 300 pages in length. It\nmeans you could ask it to summarize entire books.\n\nGPT-4 also supports DALL-E 3 AI-generated images and text-to-speech. It also\nhas six preset voices to choose from, so you can choose to hear the answer to\na query in a variety of different voices.\n\nOpenAI said GPT-4 Turbo is available in preview for developers now and will be\nreleased to all in the coming weeks.\n\nOpenAI said it\u2019s also cutting the prices for developers. \u201cGPT-4 Turbo input\ntokens are 3x cheaper than GPT-4 at $0.01 and output tokens are 2x cheaper at\n$0.03,\u201d the company said, which means companies and developers should save\nmore when running lots of information through the AI models.\n\n## Personalized chatbots\n\nZoom In IconArrows pointing outwards\n\nPersonalized chatbot builder\n\nOpenAI\n\nUntil now, ChatGPT\u2019s enterprise and business offerings were the only way\npeople could upload their own data to train and customize the chatbot for\nparticular industries and use cases. Now it\u2019s adding the option for anyone to\ncreate custom chatbots.\n\nAI \u201cagents\u201d are one of the buzziest uses of the technology recently, with many\nstartups vying to offer the kind of personalized AI tools that consumers may\nalready be familiar with via pop culture representations, such as Tony Stark\u2019s\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. in Marvel movies, or Pam in Disney Channel\u2019s Smart House.\n\n\u201cAnyone can easily build their own GPT\u2014no coding is required,\u201d the company\nwrote in a release. \u201cYou can make them for yourself, just for your company\u2019s\ninternal use, or for everyone. ** ** Creating one is as easy as starting a\nconversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it\ncan do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data.\u201d\n\nMore than two million developers building their own tools using ChatGPT\u2019s API\nwill also be able to customize the chatbot, meaning consumers will likely see\npersonalized AI chatbots popping up in many more places, including apps and\nwebsites they use regularly.\n\n## Open AI\u2019s version of the App Store\n\nZoom In IconArrows pointing outwards\n\nOpenAI GPT Store\n\nOpenAI\n\nNow that users and developers can launch their own, personalized AI chatbots,\nOpenAI is introducing a new revenue driver for the company: Its own version of\nthe app store.\n\nThe GPT Store allows people who create their own GPTs to make them available\nfor public download, and in the coming months, OpenAI said people will be able\nto earn money based on their creation\u2019s usage numbers.\n\n\u201cOnce in the store, GPTs become searchable and may climb the leaderboards,\u201d\nthe company wrote in a release. \u201cWe will also spotlight the most useful and\ndelightful GPTs we come across in categories like productivity, education, and\n\u2018just for fun.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for revenue share for people who create custom chatbots featured in the\nstore, the company will start with \u201cjust sharing a part of the subscription\nrevenue overall,\u201d Altman told reporters Monday. Right now, the company is\nplanning to base the payout on active users plus category bonuses, and may\nsupport subscriptions for specific GPTs later.\n\n\u201cWhat OpenAI is really in the business of selling is intelligence -- and that,\nand intelligent agents, is really where it will trend over time,\u201d Altman told\nreporters.\n\n## New all-in-one image-generation, browsing and summarization\n\nUntil Monday, ChatGPT users had to hop between different apps and websites to\nuse all of OpenAI\u2019s tools, which contributed to a slightly higher learning\ncurve. On Monday, the company announced it has streamlined its AI tools into\none place: Using ChatGPT now offers image generation via DALL-E, browsing,\ndata analysis, document upload and PDF search. Before now, Anthropic\u2019s Claude\nwas the only competitor chatbot to allow PDF search.\n\n## Copyright shield\n\nAs generative AI-related legal action is on the rise, Altman announced Monday\nthat OpenAI will \u201cstep in and defend our customers\u201d and \u201cpay the costs\nincurred if you face legal claims around copyright infringement.\u201d It echoes\nsimilar statements made by Google, Microsoft and Adobe.\n\n## More In AI Impact\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI could face EU merger\nprobe\n\nRyan Browne\n\nAs we travel into new AI world in 2024, it\u2019s the same old internet privacy\ntradeoff for consumers\n\nTrevor Laurence Jockims\n\nThe first minds to be controlled by generative AI will live inside video games\n\nTrevor Laurence Jockims\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n\n  * CNBC Councils\n\n  * Select Personal Finance\n\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n\n  * Supply Chain Values\n\n  * Select Shopping\n\n  * Closed Captioning\n\n  * Digital Products\n\n  * News Releases\n\n  * Internships\n\n  * Corrections\n\n  * About CNBC\n\n  * Ad Choices\n\n  * Site Map\n\n  * Podcasts\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Help\n\n  * Contact\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n#### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
