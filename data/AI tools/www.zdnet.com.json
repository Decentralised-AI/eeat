These are the five I use almost every day to\nenhance my efficiency at work.\n\nWritten by Sabrina Ortiz, Editor Nov. 14, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. PT\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n### Table of Contents\n\n1\\.

Grammarly\n\nGetty Images/Yurii Karvatskyi\n\nThe generative AI boom might have started with the launch of ChatGPT, but the\ntechnology has now been integrated into all kinds of productivity platforms\ndesigned to make our everyday workflow easier.\n\n### Special Feature\n\n### The Future of AI, Jobs, and Automation\n\nWe've entered a period of dramatic innovation in AI and automation and it's\ngoing to have a significant impact on the future of jobs, productivity, and\nthe ways we operate in teams. Research predicts that worker productivity could\nincrease by as much as 4x by 2030, powered by AI. We unpack the opportunities\nand the ways to benefit from this transformation.\n\nRead now\n\nA hesitation many people have when they hear about \"AI In the workplace\" is\nthat the technology will replace them. However, the tools I'm talking about\nhere won't do the work for you -- rather they can increase _your_  work\nproductivity.\n\nThese AI tools can help you complete small yet necessary daily tasks that --\nin the long run -- add up to lots of saved time. The result: You spend less\ntime on admin and more time doing things you enjoy or that are more beneficial\nto your work.\n\nEven before the current AI boom, I'd been covering and testing a variety of AI\ntools for ZDNET. After seeing what certain tools were capable of, I found it\nhard to stop using them. As a result, I've incorporated several of these tools\ninto different aspects of my daily workflow.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nSo, here are my favorite AI tools that I find myself using most every day.\nInterestingly, only one of these life-hack technologies is an AI chatbot.\n\n## 1\\. Bing Chat  \n\nSabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nLet's start with the most-hyped type of AI tool -- the chatbot. I've tested\nmost AI chatbots on the market, and Bing Chat remains my favorite. Here's why.\n\nBing Chat enables me to tap into many different capabilities in one place,\nincluding AI image generation and web-informed answers -- without costing me a\npenny! These free perks are primarily what separates Bing Chat from other\nsubscription-based competitors on the market, including ChatGPT, which\nrequires a Plus subscription to access the internet and real-time information.\n\n **Also:**   **ChatGPT vs Bing Chat vs Google Bard: Which is the best AI\nchatbot**\n\nThe primary way I use the tool in my workflow is as a more conversational\nsearch engine. If I have a question about anything at all, I turn to Bing Chat\nrather than Google. Instead of having to filter through hundreds of results\nlike I would following a Google query, I get one simple, conversational answer\nthat addresses my question directly.\n\nEven better: Bing Chat's answer will include sources from which the chatbot\nobtained its response, which leaves me the option to verify the information\nprovided and to learn more about the topic.\n\nEven if I don't have a question, I prefer to ask Bing Chat for more\ninformation on the topic I need because, unlike Google, it will narrow down\nthe best sources, making it easier for me to find what I am looking for.\n\nFor example, I can ask Bing Chat, \"Help me find recent research on the effects\nof caffeine on sleep,\" and Bing Chat will highlight specific studies and\nresearch within the text response, and add additional sources in the\nfootnotes. By contrast, Google will populate thousands of results that can be\ndifficult to parse.\n\nIf you are a Google enthusiast, you could also turn to Google Bard instead of\nBing Chat. But from my testing, Bing Chat wins in quality, likely because it\nis powered by GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced large language model. Bing Chat\nalso offers the option to pick from three conversation styles and to generate\nimages right within the chatbot -- options that Google Bard doesn't offer.  \n\nAlthough I don't use these features in my own work, Bing Chat can also help\nwith proofreading grammar, rewriting text when you can't get the exact wording\njust right, and even writing messages, proposals, or other types of content\nfrom scratch.\n\n## 2\\. Canva Pro\n\nScreenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nCanva has nearly every AI tool you can imagine for graphic design, including\nits own AI image generator. However, if  \\-- like me -- you create visual\ncontent every day, you won't necessarily need the stylized output produced by\nan AI image generator. Instead, you need tools that make it easier and faster\nto create social media posts, invitations, flyers, and presentations easier --\nand that's where Canva Pro shines.\n\nBefore October, Canva Pro was already packed with an impressive array of tools\nfor graphic design, including Magic Edit, Magic Design, Magic Eraser,\nBackground Remover, and more -- and was therefore already a staple in my\neveryday visual design toolkit. However, its offerings got even more\nimpressive with the launch of its AI-infused Magic Studio.\n\n **Also** :  **How to turn any photo into a professional headshot with Canva's\nAI tools**\n\nThe suite of tools in Magic Studio includes Magic Switch, Magic Media, Magic\nDesign, Brand Voice, Magic Morph, Magic Grab, Magic Expand, and more, which\nall complete a robust range of tasks, automating nearly all of your visual\ndesign needs.\n\nMy personal favorite tool, and the one that I use every day, is Canva's AI\nBackground Remover. Sound basic? Sure, but if you've ever had to isolate an\nitem in a photo, you know how tedious the process can be using a tool like\nPhotoshop, or how badly some automated tools can botch this task.\n\nWith Canva, all it takes is the touch of a button to isolate an image -- and\nthe AI produces accurate results every time. I use this feature regularly to\ncreate hero images for my articles, product images for ZDNET \"best lists\", and\neven Instagram posts.\n\nA Canva Pro individual account costs $120 per year and includes a free trial.\n\n## 3\\. Otter.ai\n\nScreenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nIf you've ever transcribed a conversation by hand, you'll know it's a time-\nconsuming and tedious task.\n\nThe great news is AI is here to help. Whether you're a student who records\ntheir lectures, a professional who needs to create meeting notes and\nhighlights, or someone who records interviews on a daily basis, Otter.ai is a\nserious time-saver.\n\nWith Otter.ai, you can import a voice recording and have it fully transcribe\nthe conversation in minutes. The AI assistant includes speaker designations,\ntime stamps, and a reasonably accurate transcription.\n\nAs a reporter, I conduct a lot of interviews as part of my daily workflow. It\ncan be extremely time-consuming to review the audio recordings of these\ninterviews -- which can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as an hour and a\nhalf -- and then either write down the conversations word for word or just jot\ndown time stamps of sections that stood out to me. With  Otter.ai, I can\nsimply upload the audio file and have the transcription done in seconds.\n\nI have used other transcription services in the past, but Otter.ai shines in\nterms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nOtter.ai offers a free plan, but you're limited to 300 monthly transcription\nminutes at 30 minutes per conversation for all conversations recorded on the\nplatform itself, and you only get three lifetime imports with a free account.\nTherefore, if you record the conversations that need transcribing elsewhere,\nthe free plan might not be for you.\n\nIf you are like me and need unlimited imports and advanced search, Otter.ai\noffers a subscription cost of $8.33 per month. Since time is money -- and\nconsidering all the time that Otter.ai saves me, I consider it a worthwhile\ninvestment.\n\n## 4\\. ChatPDF  \n\nScreenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nThis completely free tool  \\-- so simple, yet so useful -- is the\nquintessential example of how AI can optimize your workflow instead of doing\nthe work for you. ChatPDF would have changed my life for the better when I was\nat college, but I also take advantage of ChatPDF as a working professional.\n\nPDFs often contain lots of information that can be difficult to digest;\nreading scientific journals and research papers can be especially time-\nintensive because of all the jargon.\n\n **Also** :  **This AI chatbot can sum up any PDF and answer any question you\nhave about it**\n\nChatPDF takes a few seconds to scan a PDF and is then ready to answer any\nquestions you have, and to provide a detailed summary. This is particularly\nuseful to further your understanding of any PDF and provide clarity on topics\nor pages that you may still be confused about.\n\nAs a reporter who covers the rapidly evolving topic of artificial\nintelligence, I often have to read new research on the topic that includes\nmany academic journal articles. Here's my favorite way to leverage ChatPDF:\nAfter I've read the entirety of a study, I'll use ChatPDF's summary to confirm\nmy own findings and to inquire further on points I was still cloudy on.\n\nI also like to use ChatPDF to confirm that my initial impressions --  after\nreading through the research -- are accurate. For example, I will ask\nsomething like, \"Is this statement true: According to the study, consuming\ncaffeine before bed will negatively impact the longevity of REM sleep?\"\n\nThen ChatPDF will verify that this is, in fact, correct -- and provide the\npage that supports my conclusion. Or, the AI will say something along the\nlines of \"not exactly\" and provide its conclusion, while also providing page\nnumbers.\n\n## 5\\. Grammarly  \n\nGrammarly\n\nGrammarly has been around for quite a while, and AI has been an integral part\nof its services. The platform is known for its ability to check for spelling,\ngrammar, conciseness, and more in your everyday writing for good reason --\nit's good at it and helpful.\n\nMy favorite way to use the tool is by having the Grammarly for Chrome\nextension turned on so that the AI can work in the background to catch any\nmistakes I've missed.  \n\nI went to school for journalism, and as a result, I'm fairly confident in my\nability to avoid most grammatical errors, but sometimes when writing a quick\nemail or message, I miss little details -- and that's where Grammarly can work\nits polish.\n\nIn addition to basic grammar assistance, the tool can offer other more\nadvanced assistance thanks to its integration of generative AI, which added\nfeatures and shortcuts that can provide shortcuts to your day-to-day tasks.\n\nFor example, you can use Grammarly to create or rewrite text, provide ideas,\nidentify gaps in your writing, change the tone of your text, generate quick\nreplies, make outlines, and more. You can even select a voice, which includes\noptions for formality and tone, to help compose messages for different\nplatforms, such as LinkedIn or email.\n\nAlthough I don't use the write or rewrite features in my own workflow, I can\nsee the value of implementing it into other people's everyday writing\nprocesses.\n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\nAI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged\n\nThese are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI\n\nAI at the edge: 5G and the Internet of Things see fast times ahead\n\nAlmost half of tech executives say their organizations aren't ready for AI or\nother advanced initiatives\n\n  * AI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged \n\n  * These are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI \n\n  * AI at the edge: 5G and the Internet of Things see fast times ahead \n\n  * Almost half of tech executives say their organizations aren't ready for AI or other advanced initiatives \n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment  Community Guidelines\n\n###\n\nx\n\nReplay video Large play-pause toggle\n\nPlay pause\n\n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nClosed captions Share Fullscreen\n\n### Related\n\n###  Alexa just got three new generative AI skills - here's how to try them\n\n###  This is what AI will produce during the next decade and beyond\n\n###  Get Producti AI Pro content generator for life for just $50\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.

But, which one is best for you? Let's look at the top cloud\nstorage options.\n\nRead now\n\nOn-demand allows you to purchase services as and when you need them, while\nreserved instances work like many other types of bill, where the user\nforecasts what they're probably going to need over a particular period --\nusually in quarterly or annual instances. The user then pays upfront, although\ntheir cloud provider may give discounts for buying services in bulk. Spot\npricing is where cloud companies sell off unused processing power at a\ndiscount: companies can then bid for a certain amount of computing power at a\ncertain price.\n\nGoogle represents the closest option to pure cloud, says Dave Bartoletti,\nprincipal analyst at Forrester. \"With Google, you really just pay for what you\nuse, and you get more discounts the more you use,\" he says, adding that Amazon\nand Microsoft have a \"slightly different approach\" that veers more towards\nreserved instances.\n\nBut while their pricing methods may vary, one thing Google, Amazon, and\nMicrosoft do have in common is a desire to drive down the cost of services,\nwhich has led to a price war between these major cloud companies.\n\nBut while the three firms are still competing on cost, the race to the bottom\nhas somewhat slowed.\n\n\"What's not happening so much any more is the constant battle for discounting\non list prices that we saw over the last five or six years. That's because\nthese platforms are maturing -- those prices have come down significantly over\nthe past couple of years,\" says Bartoletti.\n\nThat's where cloud pricing can get tricky, because while it may be that you've\nsigned up for a limited set of cloud services to start with, you may later\nfind that there are additional costs to be paid. So despite initial low costs,\nbills can rise rapidly for the unwary.\n\n\"It's very common for companies in the move to cloud to open the floodgates,\nlet people set up their own accounts, start building and testing things. Then\nsoon you get your first 'shock bill' -- just like your first mobile phone\nbill,\" says Bartoletti, likening it to the charges for going over your mobile\ndata allowance.\n\n\"Because each individual cost looks cheap until you start using them all the\ntime, cloud looks cheap until you use it all the time -- then it gets\nexpensive. The real powerful benefit of cloud economics is not paying for it\nwhen you're not using it,\" he adds.\n\nBut there are simple ways to attempt to manage cloud services, such as turning\nthem off when they're not being used, but in order for that to work\neffectively \"it requires someone whose job that is to monitor that,\" he says.\n\nThere's also a further additional cost you may incur as time goes on,\nespecially if your organisation is using cloud for pure storage -- because as\nmore data is created, more is stored, and the costs associated with that\nstorage will rise.\n\n\"It's a bit of a cash cow because you're only going to use more and more of it\nas time goes on -- it's a lovely, constantly-reoccurring revenue, which also\nhas a degree of locking-in because it's not easy to get out of,\" says Owen\nRogers, research director at 451 Research.\n\nThere are other hidden costs too: \"Another thing is getting data into the\ncloud is free but you have to pay to get the data back, so that's almost a tax\non removing your data,\" says Rogers, something which providers do tactically\nto ensure continued custom.\n\n## SaaS\n\nIt's not just hardware that organisations are turning to the cloud to provide:\nthey're increasingly using software-as-a-service (SaaS) packages to access\neverything from office suites to sales force automation and HR applications.\n\nAnalysts predict that software companies currently offering perpetual licences\nwill increasingly swap these to a SaaS basis: analyst IDC predicts software\nsubscription revenue will reach $130bn in 2016, a 21 percent increase over\n2015.\n\nThat could be good news, as it may encourage special offers and bundles: these\nsoftware companies want to show that their SaaS businesses are growing, which\ncould mean good deals -- at least in the short term.\n\nPricing comes down to usage parameters: the more people using a tool, the more\nthe organisation will be charged, but the cost of entry tends to be low in\norder to encourage adoption. In time, however, a healthy customer base will\ndeliver a consistent monthly recurring revenue.\n\nFor some cloud providers, this can come at a short-term cost as they take on\nmore customers by offering low prices to new customers, gambling on the fact\nthat in future, demand will increase and revenue will rise.\n\nOrganisations looking to deploy SaaS applications should therefore be sure\nthat they know what they're buying, pushing those selling on their service-\nlevel agreements (SLAs) when necessary. These are often buried deep in the\nproviders' websites, but it's important to make sure that they match not only\nyour technical requirements but also your business needs.\n\nThe system does provide benefits -- customers can increase demand for apps\nduring peak demand and lower it or turn it off during troughs. But if you're\nusing constantly more resources than you expected, then the cost won't\nnecessarily be cheaper than if you were deploying in-house apps -- that's\ncertainly something to consider if you've not yet made the leap to cloud.\n\nAnalysts warn that the complexity of software licencing encourages to\ncompanies to buy more than they need in order to make sure they're covered: as\nSaaS is at least a little more transparent and easy to understand, which may\nhelp firms cut their licencing costs.\n\nSo what's the future of cloud pricing? There's been a cooling in the battle\nbetween the big names, but they're still going to be competing for customers\n-- Microsoft, for example, has recently added machine learning features to its\nOffice cloud apps, while Google is pushing for more video in the cloud.\n\nUltimately, this competition is going to be good for the consumer -- so long\nas one firm doesn't completely dominate. \"These guys are retailers who'll\ndrive down the prices. But we don't see a market dominated by a single\nprovider, so it's not a monopoly yet. There's a few of these guys around who\nwill keep each other honest,\" says Tiny Haynes, research director at Gartner.\n\n **Read more on cloud computing**\n\n  * If AWS, Azure, and Google Compute Engine are winning IaaS, what does that mean for everyone else?\n  * Are Amazon and Google the hybrid cloud advocates they claim to be?\n  * How Google will beat Amazon's cloud\n  * OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive and Box: Which cloud storage service is right for you?
