After all,\nit\u2019s one of the best ways to get traffic, improve search engine ranking, and\nshow your expertise in a specific field.  But what does a blog post need to\nhave to be successful?\n\nWell, quite a few things, but one of the most important elements in blogging\nis the blog\u2019s length. The truth is, people just don\u2019t have time to spare to go\nthrough a 2500+ word article anymore, which means that shorter, more concise\nblog posts have become a preferred option among customers and business people\nalike.\n\nWith this newfound preference for shorter forms of content, microblogging has\nbecome increasingly popular among internet users.  But what exactly is\nmicroblogging and how can you integrate it into your business? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nDownload the Social Media Marketing Plan!\n\nGet the guide for creating a social media marketing plan for your business.\n\nGet access\n\n## What Is Microblogging?\n\nMicroblogging is a specific type of blogging that offers content in a shorter\nformat. This is a more manageable way of distributing content, as it offers\nbite-sized pieces of information. Many describe microblogging as a combination\nbetween normal blogging and instant messaging.\n\nMicroblogs, also called micro-posts, allow businesses, entrepreneurs, or\nanybody that is interested in microblogging to share content in the form of\nsmall sections of text, videos, or images.\n\nWhen the term was first coined, there were websites that were created with the\nintent of microblogging, such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Plurk, but nowadays,\nmost popular social media sites (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc) have\nadded microblogging sections to their platforms.\n\nFor example, on Facebook, you have a \u2018 _What\u2019s on your mind_ \u2019 section, where\nyou can essentially create a microblog post.\n\nOn Instagram, you can add images accompanied by bits of text relevant to the\nimage posted. All of these posts can be relevant to your microblogging\nexperience.\n\nWithout a doubt though, Twitter is the most popular microblogging platform,\nwith 206 million monetizable daily active users worldwide.\n\nSo if your business is active on social media, chances are that you or your\nmarketing team has created at least a few microblogs. These posts either\ncontained a status update about your business (like when you\u2019re going to\nrestock a certain product), a promotional message, or a curated article.\n\n## Benefits of Microblogging\n\nBefore seeing how you can actively start posting microblogs, let\u2019s see what\nare the benefits of these content formats.\n\nThe advantages of short posts on micro blogging sites are:\n\n  1. Time efficiency\n  2. Increase in the number of frequent posts\n  3. Ease of sharing information\n  4. Connection to your target audience\n  5. Automation\n\n### 1\\. Time Efficiency\n\nUnsurprisingly, microblogs take much less time than normal blogs. Traditional\nblogging prosts can take up to eight hours to write, depending on the length\nof the post and the research that goes behind it.\n\nBut micro-posts are much easier to make. Generally, microblogs have under 300\nwords, so researching topics, creating images, and writing up microblogs\nshould take an hour or less. Ideally, you could cut your research and writing\ntime to half if you use an outline generator.\n\n### 2\\. Increase in the Number of Frequent Posts\n\nDue to the work involved in creating normal blog posts, this kind of content\nis released once a week or even once a month.\n\nBecause micro-posts can be created and distributed much faster, the\nmicroblogging frequency can be a lot higher. You can actually do it every day,\nand sometimes, multiple times a day, on different platforms.\n\nIf you\u2019re active on social media and posting all kinds of content, then you\ncan start with two microblogs per week and increase the number based on the\nresponse you get from your audience. You can also use AI to come up with ideas\nand content for posts.\n\nThis way, you can constantly stay in touch with your audience and make sure\nthey don\u2019t forget about you.\n\n### 3\\. Ease of Sharing Information\n\nBecause this is a mix of blogging and instant messaging, your micro posts\nreach your audience in no time.\n\nSo if you have time-sensitive information or updates about your business,\nproducts, or services, then you can immediately share that information by\ncreating a microblog.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a flash sale going on and you want your customers to know\nabout it. A great way to inform them is by creating a microblog with this\ninformation and a link to your website.\n\n### 4\\. Connection to Your Target Audience\n\nTraditional blogging can have comment sections and the blog posts can be\nshared by users, but with micro posting, staying connected is much more\neffortless.\n\nAs most microblogs generally go on social media, it is easier to see the\nreaction that your audience has to a certain post. Either through comments,\nnumber of shares and likes, or even through a direct message you might receive\nas feedback. You can gauge the reaction to microblogging much better and adapt\nfuture posts based on it.\n\n### 5\\. Automatization\n\nDid you know that, compared to traditional blogs, you can automate and\nschedule content on the most popular microblogging sites? This is probably one\nof the best reasons why you should start investing your time in microblogging.\nAs mentioned, most social media platforms can be used for microblogging\npurposes.\n\n _With SocialBee, you can schedule and post your microblogs on different\nsocial media platforms at the same time._\n\n _Start your 14-day free trial!_\n\nSo by using a tool such as SocialBee, you can start automating the posting\nprocess and have micro-posts coming on all of your social media accounts at\nregular intervals.
