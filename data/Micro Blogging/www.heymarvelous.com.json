Although there are still blogs that\nfocus on long-form writing, many have shifted to image-heavy designs and\ncontent.\n\nSome blogs have shuttered altogether in favor of other social media platforms,\nespecially video and photo-centric Instagram. Others have chosen to combine\nelements of blogging with the ease of sharing Instagrammed images in a hybrid\nmedium called micro-blogging.\n\nHere at Hey Marvelous, we are BIG fans of microblogging as a clever, effective\nway to engage and interact with your online community!\n\n## What is micro-blogging?\n\nJust as you might expect from its name,  **micro-blogging is the practice of\ncreating information-packed, short-form blog posts that accompany Facebook,\nInstagram, or even Pinterest posts.  **\n\nDoing this allows you to convey important news, helpful tips, and other rich\ncontent quickly and effectively, without cooking up a traditional, 500-800\nword blog post. Research shows that users tend to read only 20% of the content\nthey\u2019re shown, so short and sweet is definitely the way to go. **Pairing a\nquick, information-packed story with compelling visuals increases your chances\nof capturing audience members\u2019 attention.**\n\nSince Instagram is still experiencing rapid, exponential growth, we\u2019re\nfocusing today on micro-blogging via Instagram. Although this practice can be\napplied to many social media platforms, we believe that it has the most\npotential for impact on Instagram.\n\n## How to Micro-blog With Instagram\n\nIf you want to adopt micro-blogging as an ongoing practice, our first piece of\nadvice would be to ensure that your content is unique and original. Yes, you\ncan link up all of your social accounts and post the same images and info\neverywhere, but doing so makes you look a tiny bit lazy. When you start adding\nmeaty, engaging captions to your Instagram posts, try using stories, tips, and\ninformation that you\u2019re not sharing anywhere else.\n\nSound challenging? It might be, especially if you\u2019ve gotten used to sharing\neverything you post across multiple platforms.  **Many entrepreneurs use their\nblogs and websites for business-only posts and tend to get a bit more personal\non Instagram, which creates a natural delineation of content.  **You don\u2019t\nhave to share the inner workings of your love life or health issues, but if\nyou\u2019re comfortable being a little more vulnerable in your Instagram posts, go\nfor it. That honesty and openness will likely build loyalty among your\nfollowers.\n\n#### A few tips for micro-blogging on Instagram:\n\n **Lead with the most important information:**  Although Instagram allows\n2,200 characters per caption, most of that text won\u2019t be shown until a user\nclicks \u201cmore.\u201d This means that a cute or clever first sentence for your\ncaption might actually prevent fans from clicking to read the rest! Open with\nsomething akin to a headline so everyone knows exactly what they\u2019ll be reading\nabout.\n\n **Encourage comments and interaction:  **Ask questions in your captions, and\nALWAYS reply to your comments. Request input and opinions, and thank anyone\nwho chimes in. Insta\u2019s algorithm pushes posts with lots of comments and\nengagement to the top, so do what you can to drive conversation!\n\n **Share relevant tips and tricks:**  Although personal stories and insights\nare always welcome, mini-tutorials, insider tricks, and life hacks are also\ngreat ways to draw people into your posts. The accompanying image can include\ntext referring to the info in the caption, or you can just use those first few\ncharacters to set up the post content.\n\n **Offer a peek behind the curtain:**  People LOVE getting behind-the-scenes\naccess! Show them your office, your messy laundry room, and your renovations\nin progress, and you\u2019ll win their hearts. Since social media tends to be\nheavily edited to show only the best, most highlight-worthy moments of our\nlives, being honest about imperfections creates instant trust.\n\n **Run a contest:  **Nothing drives engagement like a shot at a freebie. If\nyou\u2019re in a position to offer free coaching, limited access to your video\narchive, a one-on-one session, or even branded swag, consider setting up a\ncontest. The best way to do this is to encourage followers to create and post\ncontent of their own, using a contest-specific hashtag. Then you can select\nthe winner from among the contestants.\n\n## What Else can I do to Make my Instagram Posts Engaging?\n\nWriting a strategic but authentic micro-blog caption should top your list, but\nthere are several other steps you can take to ensure your Instagram posts\nperform well:\n\n **Use location tags:  **Whenever you can (and feel comfortable doing so)\nforego mentioning location in your caption and simply use the geotagging\nfeature instead. Users love to know both what they\u2019re seeing, and where it is\nin the world. Plus location tagging increases engagement by 79%.\n\n **Lean on \u201clink in bio\u201d:**  Although Instagram makes you work for it, putting\nin the extra effort to direct people from your posts to your business website\npays off. At the end of each caption, include the words \u201clink in bio\u201d then\ncreate a trackable, unique URL with a free tool like marvelous.bio so you can\nmonitor traffic flow from your Insta posts to your site.\n\n**Use hashtags:**  Yeah, we know, hashtags are kind of a pain. But they\u2019re\nalso a great way to get your content in front of people who aren\u2019t following\nyou yet! Using hashtags allows your posts to appear in search results with all\nother posts sporting the same hashtag, exposing your brand to a wider\naudience. Start typing related keywords and Instagram will show you the most\npopular related hashtags.\n\nInterested in checking out some active Instagram micro-bloggers?
