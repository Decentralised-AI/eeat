All of these content types can expand your\naudience and strengthen your relationships with your current audience.\n\nOne content form you may not have added to your content strategy yet (but\nshould) is microblogging, a shortened form of blogging that is stubby in words\nbut big in engagement.\n\n## What is Microblogging?\n\nMicroblogging is short-form blogging. It\u2019s most recognizable on the platforms\nwhere it became super popular, like Tumblr and Twitter. News-focused websites,\nwhere posts might only be a couple of paragraphs long, also use the tactic.\nHowever, a microblog can also define a word or phrase, share quick company\nnews, promote a new video, or share a highlight from an interview, study, or\nreport.\n\nWhile typical blog posts are very in-depth and can reach over 1,000 words\n(sometimes, over 10,000 words!), microblogs are about 300 words or less \u2014 or,\non social media, usually 100 words or less. They\u2019re written to be very concise\nand easy to digest, giving readers the exact information they\u2019re looking for\nwhile provoking engagement.\n\nYou can share microblogs on your own website, but social media platforms are\nexcellent spaces for microblogging. Twitter and Facebook are prime examples\nbecause they prioritize short written content (along with other content such\nas images and videos). However, some people also write Instagram captions in\nmicroblog format to tell a quick story. Pinterest has also climbed the ranks\nas a popular microblogging platform, with descriptions acting as space for\nquick information.\n\n## How to Use Microblogging for Business Promotion\n\nA significant benefit of microblogging is that it encourages engagement. When\npeople who only have a few minutes to spare can quickly read your content and\nrespond to it, they\u2019re more likely to do so. That\u2019s what makes social media\nplatforms so engaging.\n\nHere are a few tips to make microblogging work for you and your business:\n\n  *  **Create a microblog on your site.** In addition to your regular company blog, you can add a microblog. Visitors can head there when they want short tidbits of information, like a fun tip on how to use a product or a rundown of your latest service update.\n  *  **Choose two of your favorite microblogging platforms.** Set up an account on just two microblogging platforms, like Twitter and LinkedIn, to use routinely. Having more than that to start can be overwhelming. You can always expand later as you build out your content team.\n  *  **Repurpose content.** Use microblogs as another type of content to repurpose. For instance, you can take one of your microblogs and turn it into a podcast or video topic. Break down longer content into a series of microblogs to maximize the lifespan of your content.\n  *  **Share deals and promotions.** Microblogging works wonders for sharing promotions and exclusive deals with your readers. Use a few sentences to introduce new offers.  \n  *  **Build relationships with your audience.** Ask your audience questions and allow them to share their opinions through microblog prompts. This is a great way to learn exactly what your potential customers need and want to help you improve your products or services.\n\n## 4 Examples of Microblogging\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few examples of business microblogging in action:\n\n### A Kids Company About (LinkedIn)\n\nA Kids Company About shares podcasts, books, and apps for kids that talk about\nimportant subjects, like racism, leadership, and body image. The company is\nvery active on LinkedIn, routinely sharing microblogs like the one above,\nwhich promotes its books relating to mental health for Mental Health Awareness\nMonth.\n\n### Beyond Meat (Twitter)\n\nBeyond Meat does an excellent job at incorporating humor in its Twitter\nmicroblogs. The company shares various posts, including quick news tidbits and\nproduct photos. But its snappy, witty posts like the one above tend to get\ngood engagement with likes, comments, and retweets.\n\n### General Electric (Tumblr)\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s Tumblr page has many microblogs showing how the company\npowers things we see and use every day, from trains and airplanes to gas and\nwind turbines. General Electric also invites its audience to interact with\nposts by submitting ideas and projects based on prompts.  \n\n### Vivense London (Pinterest)\n\nVivense London is a furniture and home decor brand that uses Pinterest as a\nmicroblogging platform. Rather than adding details to Pin descriptions, it\nuses Story Pins to create quick tip-filled stories for viewers to enjoy. This\none is a tip from its \u201cSpring Home Refresh Hacks\u201d Story Pin.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of microblogging is that these short snippets are\neasy to digest, making them super-shareable. Get more exposure for all your\ncarefully crafted content by installing social media share buttons on your\nblog or website. With a single click, your visitors can share your products,\nblog posts, or pages with their networks \u2014 boosting your brand visibility and\nbringing more traffic to your website.\n\nGet Share Buttons\n\n###### About ShareThis\n\nShareThis has unlocked the power of global digital behavior by synthesizing\nsocial share, interest, and intent data since 2007.

Sumo\n\nWith tools that are always free, customizable, privacy compliant, and designed\nwith your audience in mind, ShareThis is the simplest way to have it all. See\nfor yourself:\n\nGet Share Buttons\n\n  * #### Sumo\n\n  * Inline Share Buttons\n\n  * Sticky Share Buttons\n\n  * Image Share Buttons\n\n  * Follow Buttons\n\n  * Reaction Buttons\n\n  * GDPR Compliance Tool\n\n  * Social A/B\n\n  * Email List Builder\n\n  * Unlimited Domains\n\n  * WordPress Plugins\n\n  * Analytics Dashboard\n\n  * Chrome Extension\n\n  * Tool Configuration\n\n  * Customization\n\n  * 24/7 Support\n\n  * Independently Operated\n\n  * Language Support\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Sumo?\n\nSumo is a multi-faceted website growth service that provides users with tools\nthat are designed to attract more views, grow subscriber bases, encourage\nshares and reactions, and analyze important related data. The service also\noffers a range of pop-up ad customization options for users that struggle to\ninteract with their audiences, especially in the realm of targeted email\ncampaigns.  \n\nHow does Sumo work?\n\nSumo works in different ways depending upon the category of the user\u2019s site\nand/or business. When users first begin the installation process, they are\nasked to clarify whether they are an \u2018ecommerce business\u2019 or a \u2018non-ecommerce\nbusiness.\u2019 For ecommerce users, the service requires the completion of setup\ncart abandonment and form-building basics modules, whereas non-ecommerce users\nare asked to set up an email capture and complete the form-building basics\nmodules.\n\nThe service specializes in the monetization of email lists, so this process is\nespecially important for users who hope to grow their networks and bring in\nmore cash through similar channels. The \u2018Grow Email List\u2019 shortcut creates a\ntimed pop-up that reminds visitors of the users\u2019 sites to gather information\nfor the email list, a function which aims to automatically drive growth. The\npop-up comes with customizable options that empower users to select display\nspecifics in the way of timing, auto-response, and more.\n\nSumo also offers a range of free social share button plugins that, according\nto the service, boosts traffic by 20-percent. Its share buttons can be added\non either mobile or desktop sites and even include \u2018smart share\u2019 options which\nare designed so that audiences can interact seamlessly on a variety of\nplatforms, including SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and more. The service also offers\na PRO option which claims to increase traffic by yet another 20-percent.  \n\nHow much does Sumo cost?\n\nSumo is available in two different plans: a free option and a paid option,\nwhich costs $39/month and $468/year respectively. The unpaid plan offers a\nrange of email growth tools, including opt-in forms, visitor targeting tools,\nand share buttons. It also supports an unlimited number of subscribers and up\nto 10,000 emails per month. For ecommerce users, all Sumo-driven revenue is\ncapped at $500 for unpaid users.\n\nSumo Pro provides all of the above features, but also includes advanced\nvisitor targeting tools, allowing users to remove Sumo branding, and supports\nunlimited monthly emails and Sumo-driven revenue.\n\nWhat do customers and reviewers say about Sumo?\n\nSumo\u2019s email-driven marketing tools are highly specific, which means that its\ncustomers\u2019 reviews run the gamut in terms of content. Most reviewers that have\nposted on G2 Crowd appreciate the value of the multi-dimensional service,\nthough one reveals that Sumo simply offers \u201ctoo many tools to be useful.\u201d\n\nAnother reviewer complains that Sumo\u2019s glitchy user interfaces are only\nreliable on the \u201clatest software,\u201d which forces users to constantly update,\neven when they might not want to. Some reviewers also state that its step-by-\nstep installation process could be simpler.  \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Sumo and ShareThis?\n\nShareThis and Sumo differ in many ways; ShareThis is designed to provide users\nwith  streamlined social share button creation tools, while Sumo\u2019s main focus\nis to rev up email campaigns and sign-ups for both non-ecommerce and ecommerce\nbusinesses.\n\nThat said, both services do offer social share buttons, and, it\u2019s an area that\nShareThis wins hands-down. While Sumo does provide a list of 65 social share\nservices, ShareThis\u2019 curated list allows for complete customization in terms\nof placement, design, and its ultra-engaging reaction buttons. For this\nreason, ShareThis is the best choice for content makers, artists, influencers,\nand business owners who are serious about reaching and connecting their\naudiences across multiple platforms.  \n\n* #### Website Tools\n\n  * Share Buttons\n  * Social Media Buttons\n  * Facebook Share Button\n  * Whatsapp Share Button\n  * Pinterest Share Button\n  * Follow Buttons\n  * Instagram Follow Button\n  * Facebook Follow Button\n  * LinkedIn Follow Button\n  * Social Plugins\n  * Support\n\n* #### ShareThis Data\n\n  * Data Solutions\n  * Targeting & Activation\n  * Insights & Analytics\n  * Enrichment & Personalization\n  * Audience Segments\n  * Curated Data\n  * B2B Solutions\n  * CPG Solutions\n  * Data Privacy & Quality\n  * Atlas Global ID\n  * Global Consumer Trends\n\n* #### Company\n\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n  * Engineering Culture\n  * News\n  * Contact Us\n\n* #### Privacy\n\n  * Privacy (2023)\n  * Do Not Sell My Data\n  * Click to Opt Out of ShareThis Services\n  * Publisher Terms of Use\n\n####  Stay in touch\n\nGet the latest news, tips, and updates\n\n* Subscribe\n\n\u00a9 2024 ShareThis.
