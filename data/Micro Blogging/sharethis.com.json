All of these content types can expand your\naudience and strengthen your relationships with your current audience.\n\nOne content form you may not have added to your content strategy yet (but\nshould) is microblogging, a shortened form of blogging that is stubby in words\nbut big in engagement.\n\n## What is Microblogging?\n\nMicroblogging is short-form blogging. It\u2019s most recognizable on the platforms\nwhere it became super popular, like Tumblr and Twitter. News-focused websites,\nwhere posts might only be a couple of paragraphs long, also use the tactic.\nHowever, a microblog can also define a word or phrase, share quick company\nnews, promote a new video, or share a highlight from an interview, study, or\nreport.\n\nWhile typical blog posts are very in-depth and can reach over 1,000 words\n(sometimes, over 10,000 words!), microblogs are about 300 words or less \u2014 or,\non social media, usually 100 words or less. They\u2019re written to be very concise\nand easy to digest, giving readers the exact information they\u2019re looking for\nwhile provoking engagement.\n\nYou can share microblogs on your own website, but social media platforms are\nexcellent spaces for microblogging. Twitter and Facebook are prime examples\nbecause they prioritize short written content (along with other content such\nas images and videos). However, some people also write Instagram captions in\nmicroblog format to tell a quick story. Pinterest has also climbed the ranks\nas a popular microblogging platform, with descriptions acting as space for\nquick information.\n\n## How to Use Microblogging for Business Promotion\n\nA significant benefit of microblogging is that it encourages engagement. When\npeople who only have a few minutes to spare can quickly read your content and\nrespond to it, they\u2019re more likely to do so. That\u2019s what makes social media\nplatforms so engaging.\n\nHere are a few tips to make microblogging work for you and your business:\n\n  *  **Create a microblog on your site.** In addition to your regular company blog, you can add a microblog. Visitors can head there when they want short tidbits of information, like a fun tip on how to use a product or a rundown of your latest service update.\n  *  **Choose two of your favorite microblogging platforms.** Set up an account on just two microblogging platforms, like Twitter and LinkedIn, to use routinely. Having more than that to start can be overwhelming. You can always expand later as you build out your content team.\n  *  **Repurpose content.** Use microblogs as another type of content to repurpose. For instance, you can take one of your microblogs and turn it into a podcast or video topic. Break down longer content into a series of microblogs to maximize the lifespan of your content.\n  *  **Share deals and promotions.** Microblogging works wonders for sharing promotions and exclusive deals with your readers. Use a few sentences to introduce new offers.  \n  *  **Build relationships with your audience.** Ask your audience questions and allow them to share their opinions through microblog prompts. This is a great way to learn exactly what your potential customers need and want to help you improve your products or services.\n\n## 4 Examples of Microblogging\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few examples of business microblogging in action:\n\n### A Kids Company About (LinkedIn)\n\nA Kids Company About shares podcasts, books, and apps for kids that talk about\nimportant subjects, like racism, leadership, and body image. The company is\nvery active on LinkedIn, routinely sharing microblogs like the one above,\nwhich promotes its books relating to mental health for Mental Health Awareness\nMonth.\n\n### Beyond Meat (Twitter)\n\nBeyond Meat does an excellent job at incorporating humor in its Twitter\nmicroblogs. The company shares various posts, including quick news tidbits and\nproduct photos. But its snappy, witty posts like the one above tend to get\ngood engagement with likes, comments, and retweets.\n\n### General Electric (Tumblr)\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s Tumblr page has many microblogs showing how the company\npowers things we see and use every day, from trains and airplanes to gas and\nwind turbines. General Electric also invites its audience to interact with\nposts by submitting ideas and projects based on prompts.  \n\n### Vivense London (Pinterest)\n\nVivense London is a furniture and home decor brand that uses Pinterest as a\nmicroblogging platform. Rather than adding details to Pin descriptions, it\nuses Story Pins to create quick tip-filled stories for viewers to enjoy. This\none is a tip from its \u201cSpring Home Refresh Hacks\u201d Story Pin.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of microblogging is that these short snippets are\neasy to digest, making them super-shareable. Get more exposure for all your\ncarefully crafted content by installing social media share buttons on your\nblog or website. With a single click, your visitors can share your products,\nblog posts, or pages with their networks \u2014 boosting your brand visibility and\nbringing more traffic to your website.\n\nGet Share Buttons\n\n###### About ShareThis\n\nShareThis has unlocked the power of global digital behavior by synthesizing\nsocial share, interest, and intent data since 2007.
