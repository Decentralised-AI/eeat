But what exactly is a\nmicroblog, what has the experience taught me, and why is it so great?\n\nJournalism 365\n\n\u00b7\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n\u00b7\n\nDec 20, 2019\n\n\\--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nMicroblogging: a recent term that encompasses the use of social media sites to\nmake **short, frequent posts** \u2014 effectively small (micro) blog posts. The\nname really is self explanatory.\n\n> \u201c Microblogging is a combination of blogging and instant messaging that\n> allows users to create short messages to be posted and shared with an\n> audience online.\u201d Daniel Nations\n\nPlatforms such as Twitter have become more and more popular for supporting\n**new phenomena and mediums such as microblogs.**\n\nPhoto by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\n\nWith 330 million monthly users, posting content across social media like\nTwitter in **shorter, more digestible chunks** makes your information likely\nto actually be taken in by your audience, and it\u2019s by far **easier to\ncommunicate** over these mediums.\n\nThe trend emerged thanks to the **merge of blogging and social media** ,\nallowing people to publish in a way that is faster in keeping people informed\nwith **relevant, shareable content** , and an easier mode of communication.\n\n# How are Microblogs Presented?\n\nThe content that is shared on a microblog can take almost any form; **text,\nvideo, images, hyperlinks and audio.**\n\nHere are some common sites used for microblogs:\n\n  *  **Twitter** : as mentioned before, Twitter is a common microblogging site. Limited to 280 character \u2018tweets\u2019 users can present their content through text, images, video or hyperlinks.\n  *  **Tumblr** : more popular in the late 2000s to early 2010s, Tumblr is perhaps slightly more aligned with the common blogging site with third party widgets and applications allowing users to customise their site. Content is also shareable in a variety of forms, and common interaction buttons also apply to this site, making it quicker once more to share the content you come across.\n  *  **Instagram** : Instagram is the photo form of a microblog. It allows you to constantly keep people up to date with what you\u2019re doing by uploading photos one by one. Pictures can also be captioned to allow for even more detail and a link back to traditional blogging.\n\nPhoto by Sincerely Media on Unsplash\n\n# My Microblogging Experience\n\nMy recent experience with microblogging has taught me a lot about the\npractice.\n\nIf you\u2019re not following me on Twitter, I\u2019ve been **sharing my posts** on this\nsite, **sharing and commenting on other works** on similar topics and\n**starting discussions** with people via engaging with their content through\nreplies or retweets.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to draw people to my own site through **establishing myself as\na source of information** , but I\u2019ve provided this information in short\nsnippets that have (hopefully!) caught people\u2019s attention.\n\nOur attention span as a species is declining. Take a look at some of these\nstatistics if you don\u2019t agree:\n\nCredit: Wyzowl [https://www.wyzowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Human-\nAttention-Span-1.png]\n\nAs you can see, users don\u2019t tend to look at webpages for very long.\n\nMicroblogging has been a great experience for me as it\u2019s allowed me to **share\ninformation in a variety of different forms** at a pace the reader enjoys and\nengages with the most.\n\n# Personalisation\n\nMicroblogging has become even more important with the introduction of\n**personalised feeds.**\n\nThese could be feeds on social media, or even personalised news feed. You can\n**choose who you follow, who you engage with, and who\u2019s content you see.**\n\nThe chances of content showing up in newsfeeds becomes less and less,\ntherefore **competition rises more** \u2014 and in turn, users will choose to\nengage with the content that **says the most in the least words** \u2014 such as\nthat present in microblogs.\n\n# Why is Microblogging so Great?\n\nBoth from industry knowledge and my own experiences of microblogging, I\u2019ve\ndeveloped a list of the **best things about microblogging:**\n\n  *  **Spending Less Time Creating Content** \u2014 since you\u2019re creating smaller snippets of content, it won\u2019t take you hours to write a post on a microblog like it might an ordinary blog.\n  *  **Easier Digestion of Content** \u2014 people are more likely to take notice of smaller pieces of content and remember them than they are longer content. Smaller snippets are easier to digest, process and understand.\n  *  **Catching Reader Attention** \u2014 you can use added features like GIFS, photos, video to catch reader attention \u2014 often these will take up most of the space of a tweet, so they\u2019re a great addition to include.\n  *  **Frequency of Content Shared** \u2014 content can be shared at all times of day pretty much non stop. This is great for updating certain situations e.g. news and current events like debates or catastrophe.\n  *  **Sharing Straight Away** \u2014 there\u2019s no need to wait for a publishing team or for anything to be printed, the content you share on a microblog simply needs to be proofread and then can be shared instantly, often making microblogging sites some of the first to break important news.\n  *  **Engagement and Community** \u2014 since a lot of people tend to write on the same news or topics, you can find yourself a community on microblogging sites. These accounts will often comment on each others\u2019 work and share similar content.\n  *  **Mobile Convenience** \u2014 Twitter is far better as a mobile site, as are a lot of other microblogging sites. This allows for creating on the go!\n\n# What Have I Gained?\n\nMicroblogging has taught me the skills to **present news in a variety of\ndifferent forms.**\n\nFor example, when sharing my blog posts, I had to ensure I included a snippet\nof the content that described enough of the blog post to **catch people\u2019s\nattention, but within a character limit.**\n\nIt has also taught me further to read a whole article and **comment on the\nmost prominent details**. For example, when commenting via retweet on other\nTweets, I\u2019ve only 280 characters to sum up my opinion and start a discussion.\nMicroblogging has, therefore, taught me even further to **read with an\nanalytical eye** and challenge myself to **find the best language to sum up my\nfindings.**\n\nPhoto by Kon Karampelas on Unsplash\n\nOverall, my experience with microblogging has further developed a lot of the\nskills I have gained during my time at university, but also challenged me in\nterms of expressing myself within a smaller character count and helped me to\n**be more articulate with the specific language I use.**\n\nOne element that was incredibly difficult, which many may not have expected\nconsidering I\u2019m from a generation who has grown up with the internet, was\n**being online often enough.**\n\nOn numerous occasions I found myself sat thinking **\u2018what could I be\ncommenting on now\u2019** when completing other tasks. There\u2019s such a wealth of\ninformation shared on platforms like Twitter, that even taking a couple of\nhours in the day off can mean you **miss out on important snippets of\ninformation.**\n\nWhen this did happen, I would ensure to **set time aside the next time I was\nonline** to find and comment on some quality content to make up for the time I\nhad missed!\n\n _For more on journalism and journalism related topics, make sure to keep up\nto date by following me on_ _Facebook_ _and_ _Twitter._\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the\nworld.\n\n## Free\n\nDistraction-free reading.
