But what exactly is a\nmicroblog, what has the experience taught me, and why is it so great?\n\nJournalism 365\n\n\u00b7\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n\u00b7\n\nDec 20, 2019\n\n\\--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nMicroblogging: a recent term that encompasses the use of social media sites to\nmake **short, frequent posts** \u2014 effectively small (micro) blog posts. The\nname really is self explanatory.\n\n> \u201c Microblogging is a combination of blogging and instant messaging that\n> allows users to create short messages to be posted and shared with an\n> audience online.\u201d Daniel Nations\n\nPlatforms such as Twitter have become more and more popular for supporting\n**new phenomena and mediums such as microblogs.**\n\nPhoto by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\n\nWith 330 million monthly users, posting content across social media like\nTwitter in **shorter, more digestible chunks** makes your information likely\nto actually be taken in by your audience, and it\u2019s by far **easier to\ncommunicate** over these mediums.\n\nThe trend emerged thanks to the **merge of blogging and social media** ,\nallowing people to publish in a way that is faster in keeping people informed\nwith **relevant, shareable content** , and an easier mode of communication.\n\n# How are Microblogs Presented?\n\nThe content that is shared on a microblog can take almost any form; **text,\nvideo, images, hyperlinks and audio.**\n\nHere are some common sites used for microblogs:\n\n  *  **Twitter** : as mentioned before, Twitter is a common microblogging site. Limited to 280 character \u2018tweets\u2019 users can present their content through text, images, video or hyperlinks.\n  *  **Tumblr** : more popular in the late 2000s to early 2010s, Tumblr is perhaps slightly more aligned with the common blogging site with third party widgets and applications allowing users to customise their site. Content is also shareable in a variety of forms, and common interaction buttons also apply to this site, making it quicker once more to share the content you come across.\n  *  **Instagram** : Instagram is the photo form of a microblog. It allows you to constantly keep people up to date with what you\u2019re doing by uploading photos one by one. Pictures can also be captioned to allow for even more detail and a link back to traditional blogging.\n\nPhoto by Sincerely Media on Unsplash\n\n# My Microblogging Experience\n\nMy recent experience with microblogging has taught me a lot about the\npractice.\n\nIf you\u2019re not following me on Twitter, I\u2019ve been **sharing my posts** on this\nsite, **sharing and commenting on other works** on similar topics and\n**starting discussions** with people via engaging with their content through\nreplies or retweets.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to draw people to my own site through **establishing myself as\na source of information** , but I\u2019ve provided this information in short\nsnippets that have (hopefully!) caught people\u2019s attention.\n\nOur attention span as a species is declining. Take a look at some of these\nstatistics if you don\u2019t agree:\n\nCredit: Wyzowl [https://www.wyzowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Human-\nAttention-Span-1.png]\n\nAs you can see, users don\u2019t tend to look at webpages for very long.\n\nMicroblogging has been a great experience for me as it\u2019s allowed me to **share\ninformation in a variety of different forms** at a pace the reader enjoys and\nengages with the most.\n\n# Personalisation\n\nMicroblogging has become even more important with the introduction of\n**personalised feeds.**\n\nThese could be feeds on social media, or even personalised news feed. You can\n**choose who you follow, who you engage with, and who\u2019s content you see.**\n\nThe chances of content showing up in newsfeeds becomes less and less,\ntherefore **competition rises more** \u2014 and in turn, users will choose to\nengage with the content that **says the most in the least words** \u2014 such as\nthat present in microblogs.\n\n# Why is Microblogging so Great?\n\nBoth from industry knowledge and my own experiences of microblogging, I\u2019ve\ndeveloped a list of the **best things about microblogging:**\n\n  *  **Spending Less Time Creating Content** \u2014 since you\u2019re creating smaller snippets of content, it won\u2019t take you hours to write a post on a microblog like it might an ordinary blog.\n  *  **Easier Digestion of Content** \u2014 people are more likely to take notice of smaller pieces of content and remember them than they are longer content. Smaller snippets are easier to digest, process and understand.\n  *  **Catching Reader Attention** \u2014 you can use added features like GIFS, photos, video to catch reader attention \u2014 often these will take up most of the space of a tweet, so they\u2019re a great addition to include.\n  *  **Frequency of Content Shared** \u2014 content can be shared at all times of day pretty much non stop. This is great for updating certain situations e.g. news and current events like debates or catastrophe.\n  *  **Sharing Straight Away** \u2014 there\u2019s no need to wait for a publishing team or for anything to be printed, the content you share on a microblog simply needs to be proofread and then can be shared instantly, often making microblogging sites some of the first to break important news.\n  *  **Engagement and Community** \u2014 since a lot of people tend to write on the same news or topics, you can find yourself a community on microblogging sites. These accounts will often comment on each others\u2019 work and share similar content.\n  *  **Mobile Convenience** \u2014 Twitter is far better as a mobile site, as are a lot of other microblogging sites. This allows for creating on the go!\n\n# What Have I Gained?\n\nMicroblogging has taught me the skills to **present news in a variety of\ndifferent forms.**\n\nFor example, when sharing my blog posts, I had to ensure I included a snippet\nof the content that described enough of the blog post to **catch people\u2019s\nattention, but within a character limit.**\n\nIt has also taught me further to read a whole article and **comment on the\nmost prominent details**. For example, when commenting via retweet on other\nTweets, I\u2019ve only 280 characters to sum up my opinion and start a discussion.\nMicroblogging has, therefore, taught me even further to **read with an\nanalytical eye** and challenge myself to **find the best language to sum up my\nfindings.**\n\nPhoto by Kon Karampelas on Unsplash\n\nOverall, my experience with microblogging has further developed a lot of the\nskills I have gained during my time at university, but also challenged me in\nterms of expressing myself within a smaller character count and helped me to\n**be more articulate with the specific language I use.**\n\nOne element that was incredibly difficult, which many may not have expected\nconsidering I\u2019m from a generation who has grown up with the internet, was\n**being online often enough.**\n\nOn numerous occasions I found myself sat thinking **\u2018what could I be\ncommenting on now\u2019** when completing other tasks. There\u2019s such a wealth of\ninformation shared on platforms like Twitter, that even taking a couple of\nhours in the day off can mean you **miss out on important snippets of\ninformation.**\n\nWhen this did happen, I would ensure to **set time aside the next time I was\nonline** to find and comment on some quality content to make up for the time I\nhad missed!\n\n _For more on journalism and journalism related topics, make sure to keep up\nto date by following me on_ _Facebook_ _and_ _Twitter._\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the\nworld.\n\n## Free\n\nDistraction-free reading.

Coming up with a simple and\nclear pricing strategy is really complicated.\n\nMark Stiving\n\nMark is an educator at heart as well as a pricing expert, and in this episode,\nI ask him all kinds of questions about how to determine, test, communicate,\nand adjust pricing.\n\nIn this conversation, we talk about the difference between a Will I decision,\nand a Which one decision, how to raise prices, and why so many product prices\nend in nine.\n\n _The following interview is adapted from my podcast,_ _Subscription Stories:\nTrue Tales from the Trenches_ _._\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Mark, welcome._\n\nMark Stiving: Thank you, Robbie. It is so good to be here.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: You\u2019re quite the expert on pricing strategy. Was that\nsomething that you wanted to be since you were a little boy, or was there\nsomething that happened along the way that made you focus on this quasi\nart/quasi science of business pricing?_\n\nMark Stiving: I\u2019ve talked to hundreds, if not thousands, of pricing people,\nand nobody grows up wanting to be a pricing person. Now, it turns out I was\ncurious about pricing as a little boy. I remember going to the grocery store\nwith my mom and seeing prices that ended in 9, 69, and 99. I always wondered,\nWhy do companies do that? We know 99 is a dollar. What\u2019s the big deal? Then I\nhad a chance in a doctoral program at UC Berkeley to test this, does it really\nwork or not? And it turns out this 9 cents thing really works.\n\nI was able to figure it out. It works because we are lazy subtractors. I\nbecame addicted to understanding how people use prices to make decisions. And\nfrom that point, you go into how do companies use that information to make\nbetter decisions. That\u2019s where I got this bug from.\n\nThe Psychology Behind 9-Ending Prices: People are lazy subtractors. This\ntechnique capitalizes on our inherent inclination to round down mentally,\nemphasizing significant digits.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I love that you remember it from being a kid, those 99s, and\nthat you can synthesize your doctoral research with: people are lazy\nsubtractors._\n\nMark Stiving: It took a long time to get to that point. But it is true, and in\nfact, let me give you quick proof points. When you shop for gasoline, and\nyou\u2019re comparing two gas station prices. Do you subtract the 9-tenths of a\ncent, or do you just ignore that piece?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I ignore it._\n\nMark Stiving: As you do the pennies too, by the way. And what you really do is\nsubtract from the left digit towards the right, and once you find a left digit\nthat\u2019s different, you stop subtracting.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Interesting. I guess the other part of it is that for me,\nit\u2019s relatively insignificant, as well as for them. You know every penny\nmatters._\n\nMark Stiving: That\u2019s exactly right. You don\u2019t make a mistake by ignoring the\nright-hand digits in your choice decisions.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yeah, it\u2019s so interesting. I\u2019m curious, you said nobody wants\nto be a pricing expert when they\u2019re little kids. But as we grow up and work in\nbusinesses, we realize that pricing pops up periodically in our work, and most\nof us who aren\u2019t pricing experts don\u2019t exactly know what to do. Pricing is\nhard._\n\nWhere should pricing belong? Because it often seems like it pops up as a\nsurprise. We\u2019ve got to figure out pricing, or is this the right price? Where\nshould it fit in the business strategy? And what should be pricing\u2019s role\nrelative to the rest of the business?\n\nMark Stiving: First up, pricing should be really early in your business\nstrategy. If you\u2019re going to create a new product, why would you create a\nproduct that people weren\u2019t willing to pay for? And you should know how much\nthey\u2019re willing to pay for that before you spend the resources to go create\nthe product.\n\nPart of pricing is, how is it that we\u2019re going to charge for something? What\u2019s\nour pricing metric that is going to be part of our business strategy? What are\nwe going to charge for? There\u2019s a saying that how you charge is more important\nthan how much you charge.\n\nThink about what Netflix did with Blockbuster. They just changed the way they\ncharge for renting movies. Back then we had DVDs and we mailed them, so how\nyou charge is more important than how much you charge.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I want to take this apart a little bit because I think it\u2019s\nimportant. You\u2019re saying you should know your pricing very early in the\nprocess._\n\n _I say I want to create a new kind of mug that keeps your coffee hot. Before\nI start manufacturing prototypes, I should go out and do market research.\nEither have a qualitative discussion with potential buyers and ask them about\ntheir coffee, drinking habits, how hot they like their coffee, and how much of\na problem that is, and then what would you pay for it before I start\ndesigning. Is that kind of what you\u2019re talking about?_\n\n> How you charge is more important than how much you charge. \u2014 Mark Stiving\n\nMark Stiving: That would absolutely be my advice if you didn\u2019t want to waste a\nwhole bunch of money developing products that people don\u2019t care about. Now\nyou\u2019ve probably heard the statistic that 90% of products fail. It\u2019s because we\ngo out and build products thinking they\u2019d be really cool, or it solves the\nproblem for me, or I think I really like it. But in truth, we never talk to\nour marketplace to understand if this is a problem you have and if you would\nactually pay money to solve this problem? When we can do that first, then we\nbuild products that have a much greater chance of success.\n\nThere\u2019s one more really important part of this market research, that is some\npeople love your idea, and some people hate your idea and think it\u2019s\nridiculous. What you\u2019re looking for are: What are the types of people that\nlove this? What are the types of people who really have this problem? This is\nwhat we call market segmentation. You can do your market segmentation before\nyou ever build your product to know who you\u2019re building that product for.\n\nMarket Segmentation: Do your market segmentation before you ever build your\nproduct to know who you\u2019re building that product for.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Do these things early, and the product building is the last\nthing you do. In many companies I\u2019ve seen, they build the product and then\nhand it to the marketing team and say, \u201cNow segment the market, figure out who\nwants this, and come up with a price.\u201d._\n\nMark Stiving: Yes, it isn\u2019t many companies. It\u2019s most companies.\n\nTake a step back for a second. I used to teach product management. It\u2019s all\nabout, how do we decide what products we\u2019re going to build next? How do we\ndecide what features we\u2019re going to build next? And that is a really hard\nthing for companies and people to do.\n\nUntil you start to step back and say, \u201cOkay, now what I really want to focus\non is, what\u2019s my customer willing to pay? How much value is my customer\ngetting from this product? And that should be driving the decisions we make\nfor how we develop products. It should be driving our decisions. How do we\nsell our products?\u201d\n\n> You can do your market segmentation before you ever build your product to\n> know who you\u2019re building that product for. \u2014 Mark Stiving\n\nRight? And so once we understand how customers truly value our products, it\nchanges the way we run our entire business.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: You have a new book coming out, Power Value, and a new book,_\n_Selling Value_ _. Value is a really important concept in the way you think\nabout pricing. Can you talk about what\u2019s important about value for us to\nunderstand? And I also would love to tie it back to your earlier point that\nhow you price is more important than what the price is._\n\nSelling Value: How to Win More Deals at Higher Prices by Mark Stiving\n\nMark Stiving: Sure, but let\u2019s start with the value. Oh my gosh! I can talk for\na day about value. But we won\u2019t. We\u2019ll try to make it really fast. The first\nthing I want to talk about is what\u2019s called value-based pricing. We hear this\nphrase all the time, value-based pricing, and I\u2019m going to give you the\nworld\u2019s simplest definition. It means, charge what a customer is willing to\npay. Right now that\u2019s really hard to figure out. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s\neasy to know what customers want to pay, because I can\u2019t read a customer\u2019s\nmind. But when I take that as an attitude or as a goal, I\u2019m now no longer\ndoing cost plus pricing, or some other type of less optimal pricing mechanism.\nI\u2019m actually trying to figure out how much is my market willing to pay? It\ndepends on how much value they get from my product.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about what value actually means. Value could mean willingness\nto pay. How much do you value something like value-based on how much money I\nwould give to you in exchange for that?\n\nThere\u2019s two other definitions of value that I use a lot that are very helpful\nin pricing. One is what I\u2019ll call inherent value. Inherent value is what\u2019s the\nvalue of solving the problem. My favorite example of this is air. How much\nvalue do you get out of having air to breathe?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: You\u2019re asking me?_\n\nMark Stiving: Yes, I\u2019m asking you.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I would say it\u2019s way up there. It\u2019s right up there with\nwater._\n\nMark Stiving: Even above water, if you want to make it true. But I\u2019m with you.\nSo this is inherent value. You get a ton of value out of having air to\nbreathe. The other type of value is called relative value. It\u2019s what\u2019s the\nvalue of one alternative versus the other alternatives. I just captured some\nfresh Reno air. How much would you pay me for it?\n\n> Charge what a customer is willing to pay. - Mark Stiving\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Nothing. I like my California air._\n\nMark Stiving: Good. You have air around you that you want for free, right? So\nair is either worth everything to you or nothing to you. Depending on if we\u2019re\ntalking about inherent value or relative value.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Okay, this an AHA! for me. This is really valuable, because\nI\u2019ve thought about this a lot, and I love the way you frame this as something\ncan be really valuable, but you\u2019re not willing to pay for it._\n\nMark Stiving: You\u2019re spot on. The way we think about this is, we build\nproducts to solve problems for customers. And I could solve a really valuable\nproblem for a customer but if I have a competitor who solves that exact same\nproblem at a really low price, I can\u2019t get a customer to pay me a ton of\nmoney, because they have alternatives that are much lower priced. So when I\u2019m\nthinking about pricing a product, the very first thing I ever think about is,\n\u201cDo I have a competitor?\u201d And if so, \u201cWho is that competitor?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s going\non inside my buyer\u2019s mind as they decide?\u201d, \u201cAm I going to buy your product?\nor Am I going to buy someone else\u2019s product?\u201d. I call these the \u2018Will I\u2019, and\nthe \u2018Which one\u2019 decisions. \u2018Will I\u2019 is, \u201cAm I going to buy something in this\nproduct category? Am I going to breathe air? Am I going to go to the movies?\nAm I going to buy a new car?\u201d\n\nAnd then we have the \u2018Which one\u2019. \u2018Which one\u2019 is, \u201cWhich one am I going to\nbuy? Am I going to breathe Reno or California air? Am I going to buy a Ford, a\nToyota, a Lexus or a Mercedes?\u201d. We\u2019re making a \u2018Which one\u2019 decision. When\npeople are making the \u2018Will I\u2019 decision, they\u2019re not price-sensitive. When\npeople are making the \u2018Which one\u2019 decision they become very price sensitive.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: If there\u2019s no other choice, your pricing has a lot more\nflexibility, but the minute that you start to have competition, your price\nneeds to get more and more specific and precise._\n\nMark Stiving: Yes, we can say it that way. I would say that the buyers are\nmore price-sensitive. But let me toss this into the subscription world for a\nsecond, so now imagine I\u2019m trying to win a new customer. By the way, my second\nbook was called _Win Keep Grow_. I love that because I didn\u2019t come out of the\nsubscription world. I came out of the transaction world.\n\nWin Keep Grow: How to Price and Package to Accelerate Your Subscription\nBusiness by Mark Stiving\n\nWhen I first started studying subscriptions, the idea that you have to win\ncustomers, keep customers, and grow customers was so unique to me. That\u2019s the\nmain framework I think about when I think about subscription is winning,\nkeeping, and growing customers.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about pricing. I want to go win a new customer. How do I win\nthis customer? Well, I\u2019ve got to say, you like my product better than my\ncompetitors products. So you\u2019re making a \u2018Which one\u2019 decision and I need to be\npriced competitively. But then you choose me, you\u2019re now in my world and I\nwant to upgrade you from my good package to my better package. Guess what? You\nare only making a \u2018Will I\u2019 decision. You are not thinking to yourself, \u201cOh, I\ncould upgrade to your better package, or I could switch to this other\ncompetitor.\u201d Because switching costs are almost always too high. It\u2019s painful.\nI have to deal with the evaluation again. So we\u2019ve now moved people from that\n\u2018Which one\u2019 decision back into the \u2018Will I\u2019 decision, and the price becomes\nless important and less price-sensitive. And what we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re not\nselling the value of my product relative to my competitors products. We\u2019re now\nselling the value of solving the problem. What\u2019s the problem that we solve\nwith this upgrade? How valuable is solving that problem?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting. This \u2018Will I\u2019 versus \u2018Which\none\u2019 and where it is in the Win Keep Grow continuum is really important and a\ngood framework, for a lot of our listeners who are thinking about subscription\nproduct-offering and how to price both the core offering, and then higher or\nlower tiers of pricing, or any add-ons that they have._\n\nI want to keep going on this. I appreciate you bringing us into subscriptions,\nand I want to ask when you think about all the different how\u2019s for pricing,\nwhich I want to get your thoughts on, when does subscription pricing make\nsense when you\u2019re considering how should I price?\n\nMark Stiving: The hardest time I have answering this question is defining what\nsubscription pricing is. If you wanted to define a subscription as, I pay the\nsame monthly price every month or the same price every year, then I could take\nthat as a subscription price and say, \u201cOkay, we can figure that out.\u201d But what\nwe often are doing is we\u2019re charging based on usage. You\u2019ve seen a lot of\nsubscription companies nowadays say, \u201cHey, we want to go do usage pricing.\u201d So\nis usage pricing still a subscription or is it a layer on top of subscription?\nIt depends on how you want to define the word subscription. The way I think\nabout it is that I always want to charge based on how my customers are getting\nvalue from my products.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Netflix, because everybody knows Netflix, right? It\u2019s hard to\nsay Netflix is doing it wrong, although I\u2019m going to say they\u2019re doing it\nwrong, but if we were doing usage pricing. What Netflix might do is they might\nsay, \u201cOh, you watch 10 movies a week, you have this price. These guys only\nwatch 3 movies a week, they get this price.\u201d That\u2019s really based on usage. And\nyou can imagine that usage has to do with how much value somebody is getting\nfrom my product. If we switch that into a B2B world, we think about someone\nlike Hubspot. Hubspot could charge based on the number of people on your email\nlist and in your CRM. The more people you have in your CRM, the more value you\nget because you\u2019re sending out more marketing messages to more people and\nyou\u2019re managing more. That\u2019s usage-based pricing.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Are you saying that you believe that Netflix would do better\nto price on usage because it\u2019s more aligned with how consumers see the value\nrather than pricing the way that they have priced which is for most people who\nuse streaming. It\u2019s unlimited access to all of their content._\n\nMark Stiving: It is very hard for me to say that Netflix is not doing it right\nbecause they make way more money than I do. But if I were to craft a new\npricing strategy for Netflix, I would probably craft something like.\n\nBy the way, when we use usage data because we have a solution that\u2019s in the\ncloud, we can see how many and how much people are using our product. This\ngives us great information to know who\u2019s getting the most value from our\nproducts. And so I would be watching usage and saying, \u201cWhat are my top 20% or\ntop 25% customers using?\u201d And if I were to pick that price, that number of\nmovies or number of minutes per month they\u2019re watching and put a price, a\nrelatively high price and say, \u201cHey, you can watch up to 100 hours a month at\nthis price point, and then above that, it would be this next price point.\u201d\nThey would get subscribers to subscribe to the highest level because they want\nto watch Netflix all the time.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I guess the things that are coming up for me when I\u2019m\nlistening and thinking about this because these are the real issues that\npeople think about, especially when they\u2019re launching a subscription business\nor some kind of a recurring revenue option is, is it more fair to charge the\npeople who use whatever it is the most? The most content, the most features,\nthe most support time. Charge them more than people who use less? Or is there\nsome kind of a built-in benefit to having unlimited access in exchange for a\nregular fee?_\n\nWhen I go to an all-you-can-eat, all-included resort, I\u2019m not a big drinker,\nand I know intellectually I\u2019m not getting the best value. There\u2019s some guy in\nthe pool who has not stopped with the margarita since 9:00 AM. He\u2019s getting a\nlot more value. Theoretically, he should be charged more. But the value that I\nget is in not having to keep track or not having a meter running. When you\nthink about this Netflix example and try to guess why they don\u2019t charge on\nusage. That would be a hypothesis that there is something relaxing or\ncomforting about fixed price. I don\u2019t know if you remember this, but their\nvery first campaign was no late fees.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t worry about pricing. You will have pricing security. I\nthink people are willing to pay, or some people are willing to pay more for\npricing security or ease of understanding what the pricing is going to be,\neven if they\u2019re paying a premium for that privilege.\n\nMark Stiving: You just said that I could give you an unlimited plan at a\nhigher price, and you would pay that because it makes you more comfortable.\nLet me rephrase what I said, and maybe I\u2019ll make this simpler. Let\u2019s assume\nthat Netflix is charging $20/month right now. And I say, \u201cNetflix, why don\u2019t\nyou create a $10/ month plan that limits people to 50 hours of movies a\nmonth?\u201d\n\n _Robbie Baxter: This is something that I think people worry about or wonder\nabout. Will they do better if they have a 50 hours a month plan or unlimited\nfamily now that they\u2019ve just cracked down on shared passwords? Unlimited\naccess but limited hours. Would there be a group of people that would want it?\nAnd my guess is that there is a group of people that would move to that, but I\ndon\u2019t know if the total revenue or the total number of subscribers would go up\nor down as a result of doing it, and I don\u2019t know whether the happiness, the\nnet promoter score, the satisfaction, or the loyalty would go up or down as a\nresult of that. I\u2019m sort of struggling._\n\nNetflix also recently introduced Ad Supported pricing tiers, which they swore\nup and down they would never do, and I think they\u2019ve just maxed out on the\nnumber of people that are like me, that like the security of having a fixed\nprice and are willing to take some disruption in ads in order to get a better\nprice.\n\nMark Stiving: Yeah. If I were advising Netflix, and now that you\u2019re taking a\nchance to think really hard about how you would do this, here\u2019s what I would\ndo. I would say to Netflix, \u201cTake your top 20% users and figure out what the\nnumber of hours is they\u2019re using, and you\u2019re going to make that cap and tell\neverybody else and say, \u201cLook, you use way less than 100 hours a month. So\nalthough we put a cap on you, it doesn\u2019t affect you.\u201d And we take the 20% who\nare watching over a hundred hours a month, and we raise their price to $30\ninstead of $20.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what\u2019s great about what I just did; that top 20% of users are\nreally heavy users. They love Netflix. They watch Netflix a lot. The heavier\nthe user, the more value they get from our product, and the less likely they\nare to churn if we raise their prices. It is very likely that they make a lot\nmore money if they raise prices on a few of the sub-segment of their really\nhigh-user customers.\n\nNow, are they going to do that? I don\u2019t know. But it feels to me like they\ncould easily get away with that. Now, we shouldn\u2019t worry about Netflix\u2019s\npricing. We should worry about everybody else\u2019s pricing. But take that lesson\nand say, you\u2019ve got people who are using a ton of your product. They get a ton\nof value from your product. You should be able to somehow raise their price.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Let\u2019s keep going with this. So, you now have the top users\npaying a higher price. Medium people paying a medium price. There\u2019s an ad-\nsupported tier at a lower price. How many tiers is too many and is there a\ntrade-off in the number? I believe that the more tiers you add when there\u2019s no\nsalesperson as inter-intermediary, the more confusing it is for somebody, the\nless likely they are to buy, or the more likely they are to keep revisiting\ntheir decision and make sure they\u2019re in the right tier. What do you think\nabout the number of tiers or the number of options you offer as a subscriber?_\n\nMark Stiving: So good, better, best is popular for a reason. Three tiers is\nreally a good answer for how many tiers you want. The saying that I use all\nthe time, which is very similar to what you just said is, \u201cConfused buyers\ndon\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Great. Another great line. Confused buyers don\u2019t buy._\n\nMark Stiving: Yeah. So we want to make sure that our pricing and packaging are\nvery simple for buyers to understand. My favorite by far is good, better, and\nbest. Now, if you are going to add an option, here\u2019s what I would require and\nthat is, to make sure that it\u2019s expensive because you don\u2019t want to manage a\nwhole bunch of inexpensive SKUs. You don\u2019t want to nickel and dime your\ncustomers.\n\n> Confused buyers don\u2019t buy. \u2014 Mark Stiving\n\n _Robbie Baxter: I love that. I\u2019ve never heard somebody say, \u201cIf you\u2019re going\nto add an option, make sure it\u2019s expensive.\u201d But you\u2019re right! Because people\noften add these things. I told you before we started recording that a client\nhas a $25 option on a $4,000 product. I\u2019m like, Why bother? Why not just give\nit away or raise the price a lot?_\n\nMark Stiving: You\u2019re spot on. And then the other thing you want for your\noption is for it to be something that people in your good category would want,\nsome people in your better category would want, and some people in your best\ncategory would want. If it\u2019s obvious that only people in the best category\nwant it, we just put it as a feature in the best, and we don\u2019t make it an\noption. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: That\u2019s another great rule. There are a lot of little nuggets\nhere, but that\u2019s very actionable, right? You have your three tiers. You\u2019re\nthinking I have a new feature. Do I put it into one of my buckets, or do I\nmake it a separate feature? You\u2019re saying, if there are some people in each\ncategory that would want it, then it gets its own price. If it\u2019s only for one,\nthen dump it in there._\n\nMark Stiving: Exactly. You don\u2019t want very many options. You want very few\noptions to keep the decision simple. Here\u2019s a great example of an option that\nworks well: if you are doing Turbo Tax for your taxes, there\u2019s a California\nstate version of Turbo Tax as an option. If you live in California, you\u2019re\ngoing to buy that as an option. I live in Nevada. I\u2019m not going to buy it. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter if we both use the least expensive version of Turbo Tax or not.\nI don\u2019t want it. You do want it, right?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Makes perfect sense. What about the price of free? When does\nfree work? When doesn\u2019t it work? What\u2019s your point of view on the role of free\nin pricing?_\n\nMark Stiving: Free is amazing for products that have no marginal cost. So that\nmeans it\u2019s always digital-type products or data. It works best by far if you\nhave a network effect in your business. So a network effect is where the more\npeople I get to use the product, the more valuable it becomes to all the\nusers.\n\nAll social media users are based on network effects. Right? We all have\nLinkedIn accounts because everybody else has a LinkedIn account. What we want\nto do with free is to say, \u201cHow do I get more and more users on my platform as\nquickly as possible?\u201d Totally okay with that in terms of a free strategy. But\nwe have to think of free. It\u2019s much more of a customer acquisition strategy\nthan it is a pricing strategy because what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re giving\nthe product away to build a pool of people that we can now go fishing in.\n\nThe whole point of free is to have this group of people that I can eventually\nupsell and get them to pay me money for something, whatever that happens to\nbe.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: What about free trial?_\n\nMark Stiving: Free trial is interesting. There\u2019s a big difference between free\nand free trial. For free, I use a package called Toodledo. It\u2019s what I do for\nmy tasks, how I manage my daily to do, and it\u2019s free. I used it for free, and\nI got to the point where I was using enough of it that I just subscribed\nbecause I wanted to pay the money. I think there might have been some features\nthat I cared about, but I really wanted to make sure I was paying them for it.\nBut I would never have tried it if it was a free trial, and I knew I was going\nto have to pay for it a month from now or 2 months from now. I\u2019m just using\nthis because I can now use it. And as I grew my capability, I grew my\nwillingness and ability to pay.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: This is a double-edged sword for a lot of subscription\ncompanies who introduce a free offering. They introduce it for free because\nthey want to show people that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going make a habit of it\nbut we know you are going to make a habit, therefore it\u2019s freemium. In some\ncases, it\u2019s just free forever because they don\u2019t have a premium product yet._\n\n _I had this issue with Zoomerang, which was my second subscription company\nmany years ago that became part of Survey Monkey. All these people think,\nincluding people at Procter and Gamble saying, \u201cWell, I\u2019m using the free\nversion, but it\u2019s all I need.\u201d I love the company, but it\u2019s all I need. I\ndon\u2019t need any more features. Then you have people who are very nice, and say,\n\u201cI just want to pay you because I don\u2019t want you to go out of business, and I\nreally value what you\u2019re doing.\u201d But most people don\u2019t. Most people just\naccept that there\u2019s some logic in the world that says this app is free, music\nis meant to be free, or a dating app is meant to be free. If you realize you\ngot yourself into that jam like Toodledo did, what do you do to get out of\nit?_\n\nMark Stiving: This is the packaging question, which is a really hard question.\nWhat features I\u2019m going to put in my good, my better, my best? And what we\nwant to think about, especially for a free package, is what\u2019s the minimum\nviable product that I could possibly have? Then what\u2019s the value that most\npeople truly get from my product?\n\nLet\u2019s say that I gave my product away for free to everybody for a year, just\nbecause I wanted to watch usage. I want to see what these people use, and what\nI could do then is go through and say, \u201cLook, everybody uses these 4 features.\nSo these 4 features are going for free and 50% of my users are using this set\nof features, so I\u2019m going to take them and put them in my paid tier and from\nnow on, anybody who wants to use this set of features is going to pay me some\namount of money. And 25% of people are using this set of features so I\u2019m going\nto put them in my best tier. If you want those, you\u2019re going to pay me a lot\nof money.\u201d By watching the usage from our current customer base, it gives us\ngreat insight into which customers are valuing which features.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting, and is it tough to put features\nbehind a paywall to start pricing? To price or not to price is the question.\nHow do you know when it\u2019s time to price the product? I agree with you that a\nlot of companies offer the whole thing for free upfront. Their MVP, the first\nproduct that they come out with, that they think is really viable, solves the\nproblem completely, even if it\u2019s not as elegant as what they\u2019re envisioning\nfor the future. Lots of people sign up. They see they\u2019re giving lots of value.\nBut they\u2019re also educating people that this product is meant to be free. If\nyou have to raise the price or add a price. How do you do that?_\n\n> By watching the usage from our current customer base, it gives us great\n> insight into which customers are valuing which features. \u2014 Mark Stiving\n\nMark Stiving: Let\u2019s talk about two different things. First, if I\u2019ve got a\nwhole bunch of very free customers, that may be very valuable because I\u2019ve\nbuilt a brand. I built a reputation. I built a great product, and now I can\nstart charging for new customers to come in. This doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s free,\nor if we\u2019re just talking about raising prices on normal subscription products.\nYour new customers don\u2019t know your old price. Just raise your price.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: On day one, you say, \u201cAnybody who\u2019s in before today gets our\nold price, and going forward, you get our new price if you leave. If you\u2019re a\nsubscriber and you cancel when you come back, you\u2019re in our new bucket. But as\nlong as you stay loyal, we\u2019re going to keep you where you are. Is that what\nyou\u2019re saying?_\n\nMark Stiving: Yes, so I didn\u2019t actually say that, but everything you said is\nconsistent with what it is because I\u2019m going to modify what you just said for\nmy step two. Step 2 is one of the most amazing things about subscriptions. In\norder for me to win a new customer, I have to convince them of the value of my\nproduct. Let\u2019s call this perceived value. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not,\nyou actually don\u2019t know how much value you\u2019re going to get from a product\nuntil you\u2019ve started using it. Now I\u2019ve convinced you to use my free product.\nI\u2019ve convinced you to buy my good package, whatever it is I\u2019ve convinced you\nof, you\u2019re using my product. You now know there\u2019s real value in this product.\nYou\u2019ve put time into learning it and building your own processes around it,\nright? If Toodledo doubled or tripled its price, I would still pay it. It\nwould tick me off, but I would still pay it because I\u2019ve built my world and\nthe way I manage my day around their products.\n\nMark Stiving: Now, what that says is that we can now go raise prices on our\ncurrent customers because they now know the real value, and the odds are good.\nTheir real value is much higher than the price we\u2019re actually charging them.\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s comfortable to do that. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re\ngoing to like you when you do that. I\u2019m saying you can do that, and most of\nthem will stay.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Then you could raise the price for everybody, including new\ncustomers, new subscribers, and existing subscribers, at the same time. Is\nthat what you\u2019re saying?_\n\nYou have a year. You see what happens when people use it for free. Make it a\nhabit, commit, they\u2019re not going to go anywhere, and they\u2019re getting great\nvalue. Therefore, at the end of that first year, I could charge new customers\nor subscribers. And I could probably charge my existing subscribers because\nthey\u2019re the ones who actually understand the value.\n\nMark Stiving: Absolutely right. However, can we talk about raising prices to\nexisting customers for a while?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yes, next question._\n\nMark Stiving: Step one. If I were raising prices on existing customers in a\nsubscription business, I would look at usage. We\u2019re going to look at that\nusage data one more time, and the ones who are using my product the most, get\nthe most value for my product. I would raise their price first. And odds are\ngood, nobody is going to churn. Then as we start going down that usage level,\nwe\u2019re going to get to the median point, and we might start finding a few\npeople who would churn when we raised their prices. As we get to the low\nusage, people would start to churn. People will churn.\n\nMy advice is to find that price point, find that level inside the amount of\nusage your customers are using, to where the amount of churn is costing me\nmore than the increase in profit from the price increase, and stop raising the\nprice below that level. Now, let me give you a great example of that. Imagine\nthat you belong to a gym. You pay 20 bucks a month. You never ever go, but you\njust pay your 20 bucks a month, and one day the gym calls you and says, \u201cHey,\nwe\u2019re raising rates. It\u2019s not going to be $25.\u201d\n\n _Robbie Baxter: They are the most likely to cancel._\n\nMark Stiving: Yeah, they\u2019re most likely to cancel it like I\u2019m out. But if you\ngo every day, you pay your 20 bucks, and they say it\u2019s going up to 25 bucks.\nYou\u2019re like, I don\u2019t like it, but I go every day. It\u2019s my life.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Great example, fascinating._\n\nMark Stiving: Can I give one more example before you ask the next question?\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yeah._\n\nMark Stiving: If we\u2019re going to raise prices on current customers, I want to\ngive you the formula for how to do this. This is the communication that you\u2019re\ngoing to send out to your customers. The first thing you\u2019re going to say is\nthat my costs went up. Costs don\u2019t drive pricing, but customers don\u2019t want to\nhear you want to make more money. So you just say my costs went up, whatever\nthey were. You could say we haven\u2019t raised prices in 3 years, 10 years, 40\nyears, or whatever the number is. Number 3 is that we\u2019ve added more value to\nour product recently.\n\nMark Stiving\u2019s formula for raising prices: Effectively communicate with your\nsubscribers about forthcoming price adjustments or the introduction of new\ncharges.\n\nThen number 4 is to say or do something nice for them. A couple of examples of\nthose are: you could say, you\u2019ve been a loyal customer of ours, so although we\nraise prices today, we\u2019re going to hold off on your price increase for 6\nmonths, and then we\u2019ll bring your price up; or another one might be if we\u2019re\nat that free level, we decide we\u2019re going to start charging. Say we\u2019re going\nto charge $20 a month. We could send out an email that says, \u201cHey, we\u2019re\ncharging everybody $20 a month,but because you are one of our Beta customers\nupfront, your rate is only going to be $10 a month.\u201d\n\nSo what we\u2019ve done is made them feel good that we\u2019re doing something for them\nwhile we\u2019re raising their price.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Right? I love that. That\u2019s very specific. I think a lot of\npeople struggle with how to raise their prices, how to talk about it, and\nwhether to talk about it at all or just hope that nobody notices, although the\nFTC is not letting people do that anymore._\n\nI have a question on a very different topic that I wanted to make sure we got\nto because I know that some of the people that are listening come from the B2B\nworld. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s been pricing for consumer, and\nnow you\u2019re pricing for B2B. What additional considerations do you need to take\ninto account?\n\nMark Stiving: Let\u2019s differentiate B2C and B2B. In B2C, we get tons and tons of\ndata. We set a price. It\u2019s on our web page where people choose to buy from us\nor not. And I call that TIOLI pricing, which is take it or leave it pricing.\nI\u2019m not negotiating with individual customers about prices. This is just the\nprice.\n\nIn the world of B2B, if you are selling to small and mid-sized businesses in\nthat same TIOLI-type market where I\u2019ve got a web page, and I\u2019ve got a set of\nprices. You can do it exactly the same way, right? We\u2019re trying to figure out\nhow much somebody is willing to pay. One advantage we have in B2B is that we\ncould theoretically estimate how much profit my customers will make when they\nuse my product. In B2C, we don\u2019t have that. But if I\u2019m selling with a single\nprice on a single web page or three prices on a single web page, then the\npricing is mostly the same.\n\nThe huge difference in B2B is most of your revenue, or half of your revenue is\nprobably coming from negotiated deals. It\u2019s probably coming from a direct\nsalesperson out dealing with enterprise-type customers, and you\u2019re trying to\nsell huge opportunities. I think of these as custom one-off pricing. You\nprobably want to use all the strategies we thought of in terms of what am I\ngoing to use for pricing metrics? And how am I going to do my packaging? But\nwhen it comes time to deal with any given customer, you\u2019re negotiating with\nthat customer about what it is you\u2019re going to do for that customer. The price\nand price metric could be different. You do want to be really careful that\nyour internal systems can handle whatever it is you choose to do. So\noftentimes, we choose pricing metrics that we\u2019re already using in our \u2018take it\nor leave it\u2019 world. But we\u2019re negotiating different rates and different prices\n\nThe one other thing I would strongly recommend to everybody who\u2019s in a cloud-\nbased SaaS product do is never customize your solution. Keep it standard! Keep\nit cloud, and if they need customization, make it configurable, not\ncustomized, because otherwise, your management of your technology becomes\nridiculous.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: You lose a lot of the benefits of the subscription models._\n\n _Subscription pricing and models are in part, I think, successful because of\ntheir clarity, consistency, and tracking ability. When you have customized\nofferings, you also have customized pricing, and you have to keep track of\nboth. So I think that\u2019s a great point._\n\nMark Stiving: And I know that you\u2019re going to upgrade my software next month,\nand it\u2019ll work because it\u2019s everybody else\u2019s, and you\u2019ve tested it. But when I\nhave customized software, now you\u2019ve got to test mine as well as everybody\nelse\u2019s. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s a pain.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Yeah. I\u2019m going to wrap it up. There were lots more things we\ncould have talked about, but that\u2019ll have to wait for another day. Do you have\na minute or two for a speed round?_\n\nMark Stiving: I hope so. We\u2019ll find out.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Okay. The first subscription you ever had?_\n\nMark Stiving: Probably a gym membership.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Your favorite subscription today?_\n\nMark Stiving: Toodledo.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: An effective pricing strategy that delights you?_\n\nMark Stiving: I rave about LinkedIn\u2019s pricing all the time.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Why do people end prices with 99 cents? And how well does\nthat work?_\n\n _Mark Stiving: Because we are lazy subtractors. It is probably the least\nimportant thing you want to care about if you\u2019re worried about your pricing,\nalthough it\u2019s a decision you have to make._\n\nA really great rule of thumb is, if your price ends in 9 people tend to think\nof it as a good deal, if your price ends in 0, people tend to think of it as\nhigh quality, and if you care, all of my prices end in zeros.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Awesome! The last question is, which of your books is best\nfor subscription pros?_\n\nMark Stiving: Am I allowed to say all three?\n\nTo be fair, _Win Keep Grow_ is actually written for subscriptions, but I would\nsay a lot of people who are born in the cloud know a lot of what\u2019s in _Win\nKeep Grow_ but they\u2019ve never thought about it. It was a person\u2019s observations\ncoming not from the subscription world about what subscriptions are really\nlike.\n\n _Robbie Baxter: Mark, thank you so much for being on Subscription Stories. I\nhope you\u2019ll come back again soon. It\u2019s been a great pleasure to talk to you._\n\nMark Stiving: Thank you, Robbie.
