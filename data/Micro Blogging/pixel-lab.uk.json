Though vital, this can be a time-consuming and demanding\njob, so why not make your task a little easier by using simple tactics proven\nto boost engagement?\n\nYou may have noticed on platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook\nthat caption lengths are becoming longer and longer. This is called\nmicroblogging and is one of the newer tactics businesses are using to boost\ntheir online presence.\n\n##### **What is microblogging?  **\n\nMicroblogging combines traditional blogging with instant messaging allowing\nyou to reach your audience, with the information you want to share, in a\nfriendly succinct manner.  \n\nIt is, as its name suggests, a shorter punchier blog (more on this below).  \nThink of it as a snack rather than a three-course dinner.  \n\n##### **Social Media Microblogging**\n\nMicroblogging works well on Instagram, where the character limit for a post is\n2,200.  It would be fair to argue that it\u2019s all about the image on Instagram.\nTrue, but the accompanying caption gives context to your image and allows you\nto provide more details to improve your chances of engagement.\n\nAt Pixel Lab, we decided to make the most of Instagram\u2019s word limit to see if\nlonger captions really do boost engagement. After a week of regular\nmicroblogging on the platform, our post impressions have increased by a third\nand engagement levels have more than doubled.\n\nWhy not try Instagram microblogging for yourself?\n\n##### **Less is sometimes more**\n\nSince the development of smartphones, people are spending less time\nresearching on desktop computers. As a natural progression, consumers are\nincreasingly turning to apps and social media platforms to research future\npurchases, instead of websites.  \n\nA common pain-point amongst businesses trying to promote their products online\nis that people don\u2019t want to be sold to. Micro-blogging on social platforms is\na great way to overcome this as it allows you to reach people who  _want  _to\ninteract with your business as they are already following you.\n\nBrands need to engage with their customers  _where they\u2019re at_  and grab their\nattention in the moment. Today\u2019s consumer isn\u2019t necessarily going to explore\nyour website for more information, so make sure they have everything they need\nto know about your business, on their preferred platform. Don\u2019t let leads slip\naway by not reaching them and making an impression when they are actively\nlooking for your services.\n\n## **Blogs vs Microblogs**  \n\n#####  \n\n##### **What\u2019s the difference between blogging and microblogging?  **\n\nMicroblogging is very similar to blogging, except that microblogs are\nconsiderably shorter. Microblogging is becoming increasingly popular on social\nmedia platforms, where word limits are in place. On Twitter, for example, the\ncharacter limit for a post is 280 \u2013 a micro-blog can be as short as this.  \n\nMicro-bloggers also tend to post more frequently. Due to their shorter length\nand more chatty style creating a microblog takes less time than crafting a\nblog for your website. That\u2019s not to say you should stop blogging, far from\nit, micro-blogging is just another tool in your social media kitbag.  \n\n##### **Should I be blogging or microblogging?  **\n\nIn short, you should be doing both.\n\nBlogging is great for your website as it allows you to rank for keywords that\nyour target market is typing into search engines. This makes you far more\nlikely to appear when they are searching for businesses like yours. Through\ndoing keyword research you can create content which you know will attract and\nengage your audience and make them more inclined to convert on your website.\n\nIf you have a blog on your website, you could post shortened versions of these\nto your social media platforms to increase their visibility and reach more\npeople. You can also give helpful tips and advice, answer commonly asked\nquestions from your consumers or write about a new product or offer \u2013 the\nopportunities are endless.\n\nAllow your leads to come to you by posting regular and relevant content where\nthey can see it. If what you are posting truly resonates with your audience,\nyou will make a lasting impression.  \n\nIf you need help writing your own micro-blogs, or even just want some advice\non how to boost your social media growth, contact us today for a free social\nmedia audit.\n\n**BOOK A CONSULTATION**\n\n### Free website design brief template\n\nWork email*If you are a start-up or don't have a work email address, please\nemail us at info@pixel-lab.uk\n\nWebsite URL*\n\nFirst name*\n\nLast name*\n\nPhone number*\n\nCompany name*\n\nPixel Lab needs the contact information you provide to us to contact you about\nour products and services.
