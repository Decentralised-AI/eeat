It involves creating short-form blog\nposts of rich content that convey important news, helpful tips, and other\nrelevant information that people find interesting as long as they\u2019re unique\nand original.\n\nMicroblogs are short messages crafted for a particular online audience to\nincrease engagement through real-time sharing and content marketing. It\u2019s\nunique since it\u2019s platform is a visual form of microblogging, allowing you to\nshare stories and images that make up an online narrative.\n\n## Benefits of Microblogging on Instagram\n\nBlogging on Instagram puts the odds in your favor when it comes to boosting\nfollowers and engagement. To begin using Instagram as a micro-blogging\nplatform, you need to set up or switch to a creator account.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n  * Go to your account and tap the 3 lines in the top right corner.\n  * Select \u2018Settings\u2019.\n\n  * From the Settings menu, select the Account option and then tap the Creator Account option.\n\nYou now have an Instagram Creator Account! The setup process then leads you\nthrough a couple of option screens.\n\n  * Select a category that best describes what you do.  You can even turn your contact options on or off.\n\n  * Review your contact information. At least one form of contact information is required. You\u2019ll have the option to display or hide this on your profile.\n  * Choose your profile display options. You can decide whether to hide or display your category and contact details on your profile.\n\nOnce you complete this stage, you\u2019re pretty much done! You\u2019ll now start seeing\nyour insights and direct message features on your account.\n\n### Insights Of The Instagram Creator Account\n\nWhat\u2019s great with having an Instagram Creator Account is getting access to\ngrowth tools and significant audience insights on each of the posts and\nstories you created. You\u2019ll learn more about your followers demographic data\nand how your content performs with your audience. This data also provides you\ndetails about audience growth and decline through daily follow/unfollow data.\n\nDetailed analytics is important when blogging on Instagram  because as a\nvisual storyteller, insights become your basis for making decisions in\ncreating content that resonates with your readers.\n\n### Instagram Is A Great Tool For Sharing Your Blogs\n\nAs full-time bloggers, Instagram is an awesome tool to grow your blog! As long\nas you do this with some artistic sense and style, you can definitely drive\ntraffic to your blog with the use of videos, Instagram Stories, and your\nposts.\n\nOnce you have 10,000 followers, you get access to the Swipe Up Feature. The\nSwipe Up features lets you add a link to your landing page, a blog post, a\nsign up page, or products onto your Story. Viewers can just tap on the arrow\nthat shows up at the bottom of their screen or swipe up on the Story to access\nthe link.\n\nThe link in your bio on Instagram can also be a powerful tool. Since you only\nget one link, you should be using a link in bio tool, to give your followers\naccess to multiple pages that you want to promote.\n\nYour followers get multiple options when they click on your bio, whether it be\na link to your personal website, a giveaway, your portfolio, or your services.\nAll your blogs are in one URL, like a one-stop-shop for all things that\nmatter.\n\n### Add CTA Buttons On Your Profile  \n\nSince blogging on Instagram  allows you to build connections, you should have\ncall-to-action (CTA) buttons on your profile so your readers can easily access\nyou. This is definitely helpful if you\u2019re looking into collaborating with\nother bloggers and brands.\n\nYou can customize the look of your profile through the profile display\noptions, and add CTA buttons by editing your profile and selecting \u2018Profile\nDisplay\u2019.\n\nFor Creator Accounts, there are three CTA buttons available to use: Follow,\nMessage, and Contact. Just be sure that you typed in an email address and\ncontact number in your Contact Options.\n\n## 12 Instagram Blogging Tips For Visual Storytelling To Ramp Up Engagement\n\nInstagram blogging is the best way to spark up interest and inspiration\nthrough its visual storytelling features. Audiences are naturally drawn to\nprofiles that tell the most interesting stories, stories that are personable,\nand at the same time tied up to your brand\u2019s values and purpose.\n\nAt the end of the day, you signed up for Instagram to build up your brand\npresence that reflects what you\u2019re passionate about, so why not make that\nstory so compelling that people cannot help but click follow? Here are 12 tips\nto help you with your visual storytelling, plus tips from 10 successful\nInstagram microbloggers.\n\n### 1\\. Figure Out Your Brand Voice\n\nWithout a doubt, we know that good Instagram captions drive more sales and\nengagement. But how do you create engaging written content in just 2,200\ncharacters  for your photos? This is where your brand voice matters most.\n\nStart off with figuring out what your brand voice is. Are you funny?\nSarcastic? Casual? Formal? Whatever choice you feel is right for you, remember\nthat authenticity and consistency are key.\n\nAs a brand, Nike capitalizes on \u201cinspiration\u201d and \u201cmotivation.\u201d These values\nare consistently felt in their posts and captions.\n\nAuthenticity is what makes readers feel emotionally connected to you. And when\npeople are emotionally connected, they turn into loyal followers and\ncustomers. Among the tried and true Instagram blogging tips, a consistent\nbrand voice will make audiences feel that they know you.\n\n\u201c _The blogging world, especially on Instagram, is so visually driven that\nfinding a way to break through the noise can be difficult. Sticking to your\nauthentic self and mission instead of trying to tap into trends is key. My\nmission is to help busy women over 40 look and feel like the very best version\nof themselves_.\n\n_Whether that\u2019s with outfit ideas, my weight loss journey, or menopause\nadvice. A cohesive, visually appealing, outfit inspiration-filled feed is\nimportant but, more and more, we see that showing real-life events, outfits,\nand photos is what really tells the story of who an influencer is. And that\u2019s\nwhy people follow you\u2026because they like YOU_.\u201d \u2014 Erin Busbee, @busbeestyle\n\n### 2\\. Choice Your Photos Wisely\n\nYour stories and captions are only as good as your photos. Remember on\nInstagram, great photos are gold. Before we even get into any writing, it\u2019s\ncrucial to have engaging content on your page. While your captions may be your\nmain purpose, it\u2019s your photos that are going to grab the reader\u2019s attention.\n\nFirst things first. Make sure you\u2019re only posting high quality photos and\nkeeping a consistent theme on your page whether these be single or multiple\nphotos. Your photos should match the context of the blog and just from looking\nat your photos, your followers should be able to tell your niche of writing.\n\n\u201c _I would say that when you\u2019re telling a visual story the pictures have to\ncoincide with what\u2019s happening. Storytelling is super underrated and to be\nable to efficiently communicate a story to an audience, while giving them\nbeautiful images to look at, provides them with a lot of value. It\u2019s always\nnice to make sure there\u2019s a takeaway too_.\u201d \u2014 Lauryn Evarts,\n@theskinnyconfidential _ _\n\n### 3\\. Be Descriptive. Use Imagery.\n\nWhether your caption is about a significant experience you\u2019ve had, an\ninteresting conversation, a thought that\u2019s been bugging you, or some advice on\nhow to make the day a bit more bearable, you\u2019ll need to be descriptive in your\nwriting. You should be able to describe something in a way that a picture is\nformed in the reader\u2019s mind.\n\nAnother tip is to use power words when writing your captions. The more people\nare able to feel like they are part of your story, the more it will resonate\nwith them. Make the reader feel like they\u2019re there with you, in that exact\nexperience, through your words. If you want to transform your reader into your\nposts, adding strong imagery is a great way to do it.\n\n\u201c _Often our most powerful stories come from mundane everyday moments. It\u2019s\nlikely that your life is rich with content \u2013 like the coffee date that made\nyou realize your life\u2019s passion or the cross-country move that made you face a\nhuge fear. When I create a blog orInstagram caption I think \u2018what life lesson\ndo I wish I\u2019d learned earlier?\u2019 Because if I dealt with it, there\u2019s definitely\nsomeone else dealing with it too! _\n\n_Visually, imagine: what would that moment in time look like if you were\nliving it? So much of visual storytelling is putting yourself in someone\nelse\u2019s shoes while mining your own experiences for personal growth._ \u201d\u2013\nDronile Hiraldo, @dronilehiraldo\n\n### 4\\. Try Creative Fonts\n\nAlthough it can be incredibly daunting to write captions, incorporating\ncreative fonts into your Instagram strategy is one of those nifty Instagram\nblogging tips. It instantly levels-up your account\u2019s creativity, making your\ncontent stand out. Plus, if you can emphasize and draw attention to important\nwords and statements within your blog, it\u2019ll be easier for your readers to\nunderstand the main takeaways. A great way to do this is to use an Instagram\nfont tool or generator.\n\nOnce you find the font you particularly like and works for your brand, simply\ncopy the text from the font tool, open the Instagram app, and paste wherever\nyou need the text placed. To add custom fonts to your Instagram caption,\nsimply paste the custom font text into the caption editor before you publish.\n\nWhen using creative fonts in Instagram blogging, it\u2019s important to have a\nclear reason why you chose that font style, whether you use these font types\nfor IG stories or in your captions. When choosing different fonts, keep your\nbrand persona in mind. Make sure the font type fits the blog as well and\ndoesn\u2019t seem out of place. It should flow seamlessly and add a visual aspect\nto your content.\n\n_\u201cCreate your own unique, authentic visual style, and stick to it. This helps\nyou carve out a niche in the market and makes you identifiable for brands as\nto whether or not your visual aesthetic will work for them for brand\npartnerships. Whether this is a bold, crisp, start style with a lot of white\nbackdrops, or a soft, whimsical, pastels style, or something else entirely, it\nwill make your visual work unique and identifiable in market._\n\n_There\u2019s an abundance of presets and tools available now to help you achieve a\nconsistent edit on your photos on social media, so it doesn\u2019t need to be a\ntime consuming task to create beautiful visual content.\u201d_ \u2014 Taryn Williams,\n@theright.fit\n\nThe most basic font has a connotation, so go back to what is appropriate with\nyour aesthetic. Whether you\u2019re going for minimalist fonts that indicate modern\nsimplicity, or italicized script fonts that hint romantic or feminine. Just be\nsure that these fonts are legible, and that you\u2019re consistent with the fonts\nyou\u2019re using. But be guided that there can be too much of a good thing, so use\nfonts sparingly to avoid looking spammy. When it comes to Instagram blogging,\nsometimes less is more.\n\n_\u201cWhen displaying text on an Instagram photo make sure you have a strong image\ndisplayed alongside the text that really grabs the viewer\u2019s attention, making\nthem want to read more._\n\n_Little changes in text design can make a huge difference. Be creative and use\nmultiple colors, sizes, and fonts of the text you include in your images to\ncatch the readers eye.\u201d_ \u2014 Austin Heaton, @heatonminded\n\n### 5\\. Emojis\n\nEmojis amplify your stories and conversations, and can be a great way to give\nthat human element to your captions. And since they are universally\nunderstood, anyone and everyone can easily interpret emojis.\n\nAs a guiding principle, you don\u2019t really have to use emojis in a literal\ninterpretation of the text. You can use colorful emojis to evoke the emotion\nyou\u2019re going for in your posts. For great results, try adding an emoji at the\nbeginning of your sentences or at the end so you can draw attention to the\nimportant points of information in your text.\n\nWhichever way you\u2019re using emojis, try to make it fun! Spice up your captions\nwith playful emojis to engage your readers and dress up your text. Adding at\nleast one emoji relating to your story\u2019s topic goes a long way.\n\n### 6\\. Give Context\n\nNot all posts are self-explanatory.  Once you have your photo, a powerful way\nof storytelling is to provide the context behind the photo. An image is just\nan image until there is context and background.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say you posted a picture of the city skyline at night.\nYour followers won\u2019t necessarily know where this place is or what you\u2019re\nthinking of when you took the photo. Giving some context through your caption,\nmakes it easier for your followers to relate or understand what was going\nthrough your mind.\n\n_\u201cA great way to have an Instagram post connect with readers is to tell a\npersonal story and ask the readers a question. Something that helps the\nreaders feel seen and feel solidarity or share their experiences or advice is\nsuper meaningful for engagement.\u201d_ \u2014 Julie Smeltzer, @fabworkingmomjulie\n\n### 7\\. Pair It With A Video\n\nA really effective Instagram blogging tip is to take advantage of video. Use\nthe Q & A feature through Instagram Stories, then follow it up with an IGTV\nvideo answering questions about the blog. This will help you engage with your\nreaders and give them further context into your work, which will in turn do\nwonders for your page views and engagement rates.\n\nYou can also use Instagram Live or Stories to connect with your readers on a\nmore personal level by sharing behind-the-scenes videos that you can share\nthings as they\u2019re happening in real time.\n\nYou can show off your personality, your thoughts, and your lifestyle. It\u2019s\nalso one of the best ways to get your content out there and build your brand.\nWith blogging on Instagram, the more realistic you are, the more interesting\nyou will be.\n\n_\u201cUse the one-take rule. One take on all videos, especially stories on\nInstagram. When you re-watch and criticize, and re-take again and again, this\ncreates friction and doesn\u2019t inspire or motivate you to create again. We find\nthe one-take rule makes creating content way more fun and a much smoother\nprocess. PLUS it shows the real, authentic you, rather than a polished\n\u2018perfect\u2019 version, which we all know isn\u2019t real anyway!\u201d_ \u2014 The Merrymaker\nSisters, @themerrymakersisters\n\n### 8\\. Share A Bit Of History\n\nPeople are fascinated by the past, share a bit about the history of your\nphoto, or about yourself! This is a great tip for travel bloggers. Don\u2019t just\npost a cool photo of you at a historical landmark, share some of the history!\nThis will also show that you aren\u2019t just traveling for the photos, but are\neducating yourself and your followers as well.\n\nYou can even include a brief history of your company, a product, or the work\nyou do.\n\nTake this post from LEGO, for example. They shared a brief history of their\nWinter Village series of products, celebrating 10 years of going beyond just\nbeing a toy to being a holiday tradition.\n\nSharing personal stories is a powerful tool of storytelling that enables\naudiences to appreciate your journey and be part of it. They may even want to\nfollow along and support the work you do even more. Sharing milestones of your\nwork also becomes a way to celebrate your achievements with your readers.\n\n_\u201cWhen micro-blogging, one of the best ways to captivate your audience and\nbuild the KLT (\u201cknow, like, trust\u201d) Factor, is by telling stories that:\nentertain, educate, or inspire. It should be short, powerful, and to the\npoint. This is one of the best ways I\u2019ve seen micro-bloggers build genuine\nconnections with their audiences \u2013 quickly._ \u201d \u2014 Rachel Hill, @racheltravels\n\n### 9\\. Introduce People\n\nEvery person has a story. A strong form of microblogging is to seek out people\nand share their story on your account. This makes the world feel smaller and\nallows other peoples voices to be heard instead of just your own. This lets\nyour readers know that you\u2019re also about the community you\u2019re in, and sending\noff a message that you care about what\u2019s happening about other people\u2019s lives\nand situations. People of New York on Instagram shows exactly how this is\ntrue.\n\nBy doing this, the sense of community is formed naturally, so your account\nbecomes a source of strength, positivity. and encouragement.\n\n### 10\\. Product Details\n\nWhatever your niche, chances are people are following you because they believe\nyou\u2019re doing something right. They want your insight, whether it\u2019s for\ntraveling, clothing, parenting, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fashion blogger, share where you purchased each item either in\nyour caption or by making it a shoppable post. This will avoid any frustration\nof your followers wanting to purchase your clothing but not knowing how. Same\nfor traveling, or food bloggers. Share details on restaurants, sites, and\nhotels for your followers or where you purchased ingredients.\n\n_\u201cWhenever I\u2019m considering how to market a product best, I commonly consider\nsomething unique to me that I can include in the storytelling. With so many\npeople out there pushing the same products, it\u2019s amazing what a little\npersonality can do for your image._\n\n_Talk about a memory you have that you are reminded of, or an experience you\nloved once upon a time. These are things that are unique to your perspective,\nand by sharing these, your message will be sure to be unique_.\u201d \u2014 Natalie\nMigliarini, @beautifulbooze\n\n### 11\\. Call-To-Actions\n\nOkay, so you\u2019ve crafted a great story in your posts and captions, you\u2019ve\nhooked your readers into getting involved, but the problem is, they don\u2019t know\nhow. This is where the call to action comes in. CTAs not only convince people\nto act, but also tells them how to do it and when to do it. It\u2019s a digital\nmethod to get the response you want from your viewers at the end of your story\npitch.\n\n_\u201cTry to get you readers personally involved through your captions and blog\ntext. Give a personal example and let your text remind them of a similar\nexperience they had in the past and encourage them to share it. Like this you\nwill receive more engagement, which again boosts your posting!\u201d_ \u2014 Carina\nBerry, @carina_berry\n\nThere are creative ways to add CTAs to your Instagram stories and captions.\nYou can post teasers before introducing your blog. If you\u2019re doing this from a\npost, you can even direct people to your Instagram stories to see the actual\nteaser. Aside from teasers, you can encourage your followers to tag their\nfriends, and help increase engagement. When your existing followers tag other\nusers, this significantly increases your chances of getting more followers.\n\nUse active language in CTAs. Keeping it short and sweet is the way to go.\nPhrases like \u201cclick on\u201d, \u201cbuy now\u201d, \u201csubscribe to,\u201d or \u201cregister now\u201d clearly\nhelps persuade your audience to take action. You can also create a sense of\nurgency to this by adding CTAs like \u201cfor a limited time only,\u201d or \u201cavailable\nto the first 500 customers.\u201d Including this makes readers feel that they\u2019re\nmissing out, and FOMO, as we know, is a powerful thing.\n\n### 12\\. Incorporate Hashtags\n\nBuild a community around your microblog by incorporating strong hashtags\nrelating to your niche. This will help attract other influencers and bloggers\nfrom your niche, and readers who will be interested in your content.\n\n_\u201cOffer Readers a Branded Value-Journey to Follow. It takes, on average,seven\ntouchpoints with a brand to convert a reader into a customer. As such, each\nvisual microblog you post on Instagram should help your readers begin a\njourney with your brand. A series of posts makes this possible. Start your\nmicro-blog with a long-form post your readers will love on your website, then\noffer them a way to follow your series on Instagram via a complementary (not\nrepetitive) visual journey. _\n\n_Keeping readers following your journey is quite easy on Instagram. Simply\ncreate a campaign hashtag for each blog series (or campaign) and include it in\nyour microblog caption on Instagram. Readers can start with any posted visual,\nthen click the hashtag to continue following the story (or journey with your\nbrand). As you create your journey, remember to infuse your company\u2019s promise-\nof-value into each visual asset to keep them coming back for more._ \u201d \u2014 Alana\nRudder, @thebalancecom\n\nBranded Instagram hashtags help spread the word about the work you do and find\ncontent created about you by your followers. It also makes it easy for your\ntarget audience to find you, resulting in audience growth.\n\nWhen choosing a branded hashtag to use, keep things simple so your readers can\neasily remember. Once your followers get a hang of using the hashtag, you can\ncollect user-generated content. UGC helps drive engagement, brand credibility,\nand more followers on Instagram.\n\n* * *\n\nTry Our Free Hashtag Generator\n\n* * *\n\n## Now, Go Be A Micro-Blogging Rockstar!\n\nInstagram is a platform where you can capture and share moments through\nphotos, videos, and story telling.
