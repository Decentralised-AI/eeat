So far stripe.com has a good API and seems to be the most affordable\nbut if you know other options then please share.\n\n  * identity\n  * verification\n\nShare\n\nShare a link to this question\n\nCopy linkCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nasked Feb 21 at 1:58\n\nJimskiJimski\n\n83688 silver badges2424 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment  |\n\n##  1 Answer 1\n\nSorted by:  Reset to default\n\nHighest score (default)  Trending (recent votes count more)  Date modified\n(newest first)  Date created (oldest first)\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n0\n\nThis answer is not useful\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nThere are very few services that offer free identity verification however\nthere are some. If you need to verify only a few people per month then\nhttps://withpersona.com/pricing can offer such a service.\n\nIf you need to verify a large number of people then Stripe offers relatively\ninexpensive ID verification for checking ID numbers at $0.5.\nhttps://stripe.com/identity#pricing\n\nAlso, be aware of the searches on Google for keywords such as \"best identity\nverification service\" or \"inexpensive identity verification\" etc. These days\nGoogle turned into a garbage dump of self promotion and online marketing so at\nthe top of your sarches you will see lists of ID services which are compiled\nby online marketers with affiliate links, they are neither best nor cheapest!\n\nShare\n\nShare a link to this answer\n\nCopy linkCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Mar 20 at 18:03\n\nJimskiJimski\n\n83688 silver badges2424 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment  |\n\n##  Your Answer\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n**Reminder:** Answers generated by Artificial Intelligence tools are not\nallowed on Stack Overflow.
