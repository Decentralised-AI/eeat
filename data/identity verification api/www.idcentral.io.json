Then the process of authentication would involve two steps.\n\n  * The liveness detection functionality by IDcentral detects a spoof attempt by determining whether the source of a biometric sample is a live human being or a fake representation. This is accomplished through algorithms, that analyze data collected from cameras to determine if the source is live.\n  * Our OCR process then compares the selfie to the picture in the government ID database.\n\n\n\n____ What is an alternate credit score?
