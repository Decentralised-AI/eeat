    "summary": "# Developers Guide for ID Verification APIs in Banking Apps\n\nEmily Daniel\n\n\u00b7\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nCodeX\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 min read\n\n\u00b7\n\nSep 11, 2021\n\n\\--\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nAmong all other sectors, banks have to deal with the most sensitive data i.e.\nfinancial information. These institutions obtain the financial details of\ncustomers that must be safeguarded against internal or external threats.\nSecurity breaches in the banking industry can disrupt the whole corporate\nsystem. In recent years, KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money\nLaundering) practices have shifted to regulations from restrictions to\nguarantee security. According to a report, a conventional bank can **_save up\nto 10 million Euros_** by using extended technologies for AML/KYC compliance.\n\n# Remote Identity Verification \u2014 A High-Tech Protection for Banks\n\nIn today\u2019s era of technological advancements, identity verification can be\ndone without an in-person meeting \u2014 through online platforms. Online identity\nverification has proved to be an effective and feasible method for mitigating\nidentity fraud, financial scams, and potential money laundering. Using AI\nmodels IDV can now be performed through automated solutions instead of humans,\nthe software has negligible errors authorizing only legitimate users to access\nthe banking accounts.\n\nIdentity verification solutions can be used in both phases, verification and\nauthentication. Let\u2019s discuss the first one, the customer\u2019s identity is\nverified by validating their government-approved ID documents (like a\npassport) and the photo ID is matched against facial biometrics. In the\nsecond, the live captured selfie is compared with the previously stored\nbiometrics during verification. The IDV solution can be integrated into\nbanking apps and websites through APIs.\n\n# What to consider while choosing a Third Party API!\n\nSoftware developers have to integrate extended AI-driven technologies while\ndeveloping a banking app or website. They have to put in extra effort while\ndeveloping modules for **_Facial Recognition_** _, Document Verification and\nData Extraction._\n\n _So why develop an in-house solution when you can easily outsource the entire\nprocess._\n\nSoftware engineers should consider the following things before purchasing\nAPIs.\n\n## Defining End-Users\n\nThe individuals that are directly using software or a product are called end-\nusers. The developers and businesses always identify and define their end-\nusers to provide them services accordingly. There are different factors of\nclassifying end-users like demography and age group of their clientele, and\nalso not to mention their socio-economic situation and why they are using the\nsoftware.\n\nAPI solutions should reflect the requirements of end-users with no extra\nfunctionality. It should be user-friendly and requires no additional training.\nAs banks have vast customers hailing from all sections of society from a\nlayman to a college professor, the functionality of API must be universal.\n\nMake sure you describe your end-user clearly to the API provider\u2026\n\nOnce you have defined your end-user, make sure the API UX and UI is in line\nwith the demands of your end-user. API interface should be easy to use for the\nend-user\u2026\n\n## User Experience & Interface\n\nThe way a user interacts with or uses a software product is known as user\nexperience and the visual designs, layouts and typography is referred to as\nthe user interface. As the users can be from different backgrounds and regions\nso the colours, interface and language should suit them.\n\nThe verification flow should be easy to understand for the end-user. It should\nbe self-explanatory as the whole idea of digital IDV is seamless and smooth\nidentity verification.\n\n## Data Protection\n\nAs discussed earlier, data is the most significant element in banking. The ID\npictures are to be shared with the API provider for verification. If the data\nis used for any other purpose like selling to marketing firms, it can lead to\nlegal suits of data privacy.\n\nThe data should be encrypted and stored in the cloud servers (so that it can\nbe accessed globally) adhering to international data protection standards like\n_GDPR_. Furthermore, the end-user must have the authority for the\nremoval/deletion of data after a specific time frame.\n\n## Portability\n\nThe independence of the operating system (OS) and version tells how long a\nsoftware can be used in future. If the software can\u2019t upgrade to corresponding\nversions of the OS, there are infrequent chances that it will sustain itself\nin the long run. The software should be operational on all major operating\nsystems (Android, iOS and Windows) so that it could have a wider range of\nusers. The portability of API must be studied before choosing as it can\nrestrict the number of users.\n\nThe API should pass these portability tests;\n\n **Installability:** Checking the installation on various systems,\nenvironments and versions with valid hardware configuration. The allocation of\nlibraries and dependent files is also tested.\n\n **Compatibility:** It is the characteristic of a module (software) to operate\nsuccessfully with other modules.\n\n **Adaptability:** The capability of software to adapt to changing\nenvironments or components without any additional actions.\n\n## Market Value\n\nIt is the best strategy for picking a product, for example, a user will see\nthe rating of an app before downloading one. The same can be done for\nselecting APIs for a banking app. The market value can be analysed by studying\nthe provider\u2019s clients reviews. The Salesforce Appexchange is one of the most\ntrustable sources while studying the market value or client satisfaction of\nidentity management (IDM) software like IDV solutions.\n\n# Why Third-Party APIs? -\n\nIt can be thought that if software engineers can develop a whole banking app,\nthey can also develop an identity verification module.\n\n _Have a look at the benefits of Third-Party APIs before developing an IDV\nsolution._\n\n## \\- Quicker Development\n\nIt saves the time of the development team as they do have to work on totally\ndifferent functions and modules. The span of months can be reduced to days by\nintegrating previously developed APIs. This time can be utilized for other\nsignificant tasks during the SDLC.\n\n## \\- Cost Reduction\n\nBudget affects software development the most after time. Developing an in-\nhouse solution can take months, thus more salaries have to be paid to\ndevelopers. Through API integration, the budget can be reduced and could\ninvest in improving the features and removing bugs from the app.\n\n## \\- Skilful Development\n\nThe development team isn\u2019t proficient in all aspects of software engineering.\nUsing third party APIs can give the best features \u2014 as are developed by\nskilful field developers, also eliminating unnecessary hurdles while\ndevelopment.\n\n## \\- Increased Scalability\n\nThe in-house software can\u2019t have the level of scalability that modern IDV\nsolutions are providing. As the solutions have been tested and upgraded\ncontinuously for improvements, the new software will take much time to achieve\nthat level.\n\nThe IDV software is trained on thousands of datasets to spot abnormalities in\nthe ID documents and detect fraudulent attempts. The new software will not be\nmature enough to perform verification with the same efficiency.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nDeveloping a banking mobile app or website requires drivers skills which can\nincrease time and cost, however, previously developed APIs can be purchased\nfrom third parties. The identity verification API and SDK can be utilized for\ncomplying with KYC/AML regulations without putting extra effort into\ndevelopment.\n\nDevelopment\n\nBanking Technology\n\nAPI\n\nSecurity\n\nPrivacy\n\n\\--\n\n\\--\n\nFollow\n\n## Written by Emily Daniel\n\n280 Followers\n\n\u00b7Writer for\n\nCodeX\n\nEmily is a tech writer, with expertise in entrepreneurship, and business\nmarketing.

With thousands of\nproducts available at the click of a button, it\u2019s crucial for businesses to\nstay competitive and offer the best prices to their customers. This is where\nprice comparison APIs come into play. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the world of\nprice comparison APIs, their benefits, and how you can leverage them to stay\nahead of the competition. We\u2019ll also discuss how CronJ, as an expert in API\ndevelopment, can help you create a seamless and efficient price comparison\nsolution for your business.\n\n **Price Comparison APIs: An Overview**\n\nPrice comparison APIs are Application Programming Interfaces that provide\ndevelopers and businesses access to real-time pricing data from various online\nretailers and e-commerce platforms. They help businesses compare product\nprices, offers, discounts, and other relevant information to make informed\ndecisions and optimize pricing strategies. By integrating these APIs into\ntheir applications, businesses can offer their customers the best deals and\nenhance their user experience.\n\n **How Price Comparison APIs Work:**\n\nPrice comparison APIs work by aggregating data from multiple sources, such as\nonline retailers and e-commerce websites. When a user makes a request to the\nAPI, it sends the query to the relevant data sources and retrieves the\nrequested pricing information. The API then processes and organizes the data,\nreturning it to the user in a structured format, such as JSON or XML. This\ninformation can be used to display real-time pricing comparisons, allowing\nusers to make better-informed decisions when shopping online.\n\n **The Role of Web Scraping in Price Comparison APIs:**\n\nWeb scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites and web pages\nby parsing the HTML source code. It plays a crucial role in the functioning of\nprice comparison APIs. Web scraping tools and libraries are used to collect\npricing data from various e-commerce platforms and online retailers. This data\nis then cleaned, structured, and stored in databases or data warehouses.\n\nPrice comparison APIs rely on web scraping to gather the most up-to-date and\naccurate pricing information. However, web scraping can be challenging due to\nthe varying structures of websites, the dynamic nature of web content, and\npotential legal and ethical concerns. To ensure compliance with web scraping\nregulations, price comparison API developers must carefully consider the data\nthey collect and the methods they use to obtain it.\n\n **The Benefits of Price Comparison APIs**\n\n  1. Real-time Price Tracking: One of the most significant advantages of price comparison APIs is the ability to access real-time pricing data from multiple online retailers and e-commerce platforms. This enables businesses and developers to stay up-to-date with the latest price changes, promotions, and discounts. By having access to real-time information, businesses can make quick and informed decisions about their pricing strategies and react promptly to market changes.\n  2. Enhancing Customer Experience: Integrating price comparison APIs into applications, websites, or e-commerce platforms can significantly improve the customer experience. By offering users the convenience of comparing prices from various sources in one place, businesses can help their customers find the best deals and make informed purchasing decisions. This enhanced user experience can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business.\n  3. Competitive Pricing Strategy: Price comparison APIs can help businesses develop and maintain a competitive pricing strategy. By providing insights into the pricing strategies of competitors, businesses can analyze market trends and adjust their pricing accordingly. This can lead to increased sales, higher revenue, and a competitive edge in the market.\n  4. Inventory Management: Price comparison APIs can play a crucial role in inventory management by providing businesses with insights into market demand, popular products, and price trends. By monitoring the pricing data of similar products across different platforms, businesses can make informed decisions about their inventory levels, pricing, and product assortment. This can help optimize inventory management processes, reduce stockouts and overstocks, and improve overall operational efficiency.\n\n **Popular Price Comparison APIs in the Market**\n\n  1. Amazon Product Advertising API: The Amazon Product Advertising API provides programmatic access to Amazon\u2019s massive product catalog and enables developers to advertise Amazon products on their websites and applications. This API offers features such as product search, product details, customer reviews, and product recommendations, which can be used to create a comprehensive price comparison solution for users.\n  2. Google Shopping API: Google Shopping API, formerly known as Google Shopping Content API, allows developers to manage their product listings on Google Shopping. It offers features such as product search, product details, and price information from multiple retailers. This API enables developers to integrate Google Shopping data into their applications, offering users the ability to compare prices across different platforms and find the best deals.\n  3. eBay API: The eBay API offers a suite of services that allow developers to access eBay\u2019s massive marketplace and integrate it into their applications. With features such as product search, product details, and pricing information, developers can create price comparison solutions that help users find the best deals on eBay. The eBay API also offers additional features like bidding, listing, and order management for a more comprehensive integration.\n  4. Walmart API: The Walmart API enables developers to access product data from Walmart, one of the largest retail chains in the world. This API offers features such as product search, product details, price information, and store availability. By integrating the Walmart API into their applications, developers can offer users the ability to compare prices and find the best deals from Walmart\u2019s extensive product catalog.\n\n **Key Features to Look for in a Price Comparison API**\n\n  1. Data accuracy: When selecting a price comparison API, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that the API provides accurate and up-to-date pricing information. This helps users make informed decisions and builds trust in your price comparison tool.\n  2. API call limits and rate limiting: Different APIs have different limits on the number of calls you can make within a specific time frame. It\u2019s essential to consider these limitations when selecting a price comparison API, as they can impact the performance of your application, especially during peak usage times.\n  3. Ease of integration: Choose a price comparison API that is easy to integrate with your existing system or application. APIs with clear documentation, sample code, and SDKs can simplify the integration process and save you time and effort.\n  4. Comprehensive documentation and support: Good documentation and support are essential for a smooth integration process. Look for APIs that offer comprehensive documentation, FAQs, and responsive support channels to help you address any issues that may arise during the integration process.\n\n **Custom Price Comparison API Development with CronJ**\n\n  1.
