Using an identity verification API can help prevent fraud\nand increase the safety of your business, by ensuring that the users signing\nup for your platform are indeed who they claim to be.\n\nIdentity verification APIs can be used across a wide variety of industries,\nincluding finance and banking, healthcare, and education, among others. With\nan identity verification API businesses can:\n\n  * Capture IDs and extract ID information, including driver\u2019s licenses, passports, etc.\n  * Verify authenticity for the information captured from those IDs\n  * Match selfies and photos to IDs\n  * Validate Social Security numbers (SSNs) and Tax Identification numbers (TINs)\n  * Verify phone numbers\n  * Use utility, government, and bank login portals to verify an identity\n  * Pull credit reports and other banking and financial information\n\n  \nBusinesses can use a service like Plaid, for example, to help verify new user\nidentities. When using Modern Treasury, businesses can take advantage of our\npartnership with Plaid to easily and quickly verify new users and their\nrelevant banking information.
