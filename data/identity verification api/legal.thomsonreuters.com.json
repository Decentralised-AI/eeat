An increasingly complex financial regulatory\nenvironment demands that firms be assured that they aren't working with\nillicit enterprises, or people with ties to illicit activity. Increased\nscrutiny is all but guaranteed in the wake of high-profile money-laundering\nscandals, but revelations need not be earth-shattering in order to impact a\ncompany's bottom line. For example, so-called synthetic identity fraud \u2013 where\na criminal uses a completely fake persona to acquire credit, leaving\ninvestigators chasing a ghost \u2013 costs banks as much as $6 billion per year,\naccording to the Auriemma Group.1\n\nAt the same time, prospective customers want their financial services\nproviders to make onboarding as easy and seamless as possible, despite the\nfact that banks and regulators want significant assurance that these customers\ncan verify who they say they are. Effective deployment of technology that can\ningest and process a range of data sources is crucial to provide a smooth\ncustomer onboarding experience while meeting regulatory requirements.\n\n## Implementing FinCEN AML rules with API technology\n\nIn July 2018, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\nimplemented new rules around Customer Due Diligence for Financial Institutions\nunder the Bank Secrecy Act. The stated goal of the regulatory update was to\npatch a hole in existing law; regulators noted that prior to the act, firms\nhad no obligation to know the identity of beneficial owners of their customer\n\u2013 that is, the people who own more than a quarter of their prospective client\ncompany.  \n\n> Criminals using fake personas to get credit cost banks as much as $6 billion\n> per year.\n\n\"This enables criminals, kleptocrats, and others looking to hide ill-gotten\nproceeds to access the financial system anonymously,\" FinCEN wrote in its\nannouncement of new customer due-diligence requirements. The organization also\nadvised four \"core elements\" that were required as part of anti-money\nlaundering rules:\n\n  1. Customer identification and verification\n  2. Beneficial ownership identification and verification\n  3. Understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop a customer risk profile\n  4. Ongoing monitoring for reporting suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, maintaining and updating customer information 2\n\nFortunately, advances in data and analytics technology make it relatively easy\nfor financial institutions of all sizes to meet regulators' demands without\nbeing too onerous for customers. In the blink of an eye, organizations can\naccess information from a wide swath of sources from public records, private\nrecords, and governments. These include phone records, credit bureaus, DMV\ninformation, arrest records, utilities, court records, and business data,\nwhich can be accessed via application programming interfaces (APIs) during the\ncustomer onboarding process. Getting quick access to information that confirms\nan applicant's identity makes closing a customer easier and faster. In\naddition, APIs allow access to cleaner data and more accurate identification,\nthus helping to mitigate risk such as monetary fines and reputational damage\nthat can go along with false identification.\n\nHowever, for ID verification, adoption of this technology has been slow.\nAccording to the Digital Banking Report's 2017 Account Opening and Onboarding\nBenchmarking Study, \"ID verification and signatures/supporting documentation\n'at the branch' are still required by the majority of organizations\" even if\nmuch of the other required work to open accounts is done online. This is\nespecially true for smaller institutions. According to Jim Marous, co-\npublisher of The Financial Brand and publisher of the Digital Banking Report,\n\"there are many providers of services to improve the digital account opening\nprocess. These firms can help remove friction, increase engagement and improve\ncustomer satisfaction.\" 3\n\n## Integrating API to ease the onboarding process\n\nThe use of APIs has exploded over the past several years as governments and\nother institutions have digitized records, and financial firms have attempted\nto tap into that data to make the process of identifying prospects easier. In\n2014 there were more than 10,000 public APIs available for use, according to\nDeloitte \u2013 but with the right partners, financial institutions can access more\nthan just public data.4\n\nIn an API-driven world, financial institutions can perform the dual goal of\nmeeting ID verification rules also while providing a better onboarding\nexperience for the customer. An increasing number of firms are growing\ncomfortable with public cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings,\nwhich allow them to scale up and down as their data needs ebb and flow.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers notes in its report, \"Financial Services Technology\n2020 and Beyond: Embracing Disruption,\" that an increasing number of financial\ncompanies \"turn to SaaS for \u2018point solutions\u2019 on the fringes of their\noperations, including security analytics and KYC [know your customer]\nverification.\" Firms are even able to automate a good portion of the data\nverification.5  \n\nThis can be applied to all sorts of customers, including businesses, in the\ncase of commercial banks. Bain & Co. estimates that new regulations related to\nID verification have driven customer-acquisition costs in commercial banking\nas high as $5,000 per client in some cases. The firm also notes that as firms\nhave had to change their onboarding processes, that has led to delays in\nacquiring customers of up to 90 days, causing a substantial amount of lost\nrevenue \u2013 sometimes as much as $25,000 per client.\n\n### To make onboarding easier while retaining records for regulatory audit\nrequirements, Bain suggests banks:\n\n  1. Identify what data and information the organization truly needs to ensure compliance\n  2. Align globally by creating a common set of ID verification questions across locations, simplifying the onboarding experience\n  3. Enable customer self-service through an intuitive digital portal that allows data to be pre-populated based on API calls\n  4. Dedicate specialist teams that are responsible for governance across the organization and ensure that procedures match changing regulations\n  5. Create global centers of excellence that concentrate on onboarding in local regions 6\n\nOf these tips, API-enabled automation specifically helps the first and third.\nIntegrating ID verification into the onboarding process using API technology\nmeans that banks no longer have to choose between an optimal customer\nexperience and regulatory compliance. Once organizations identify the specific\ndata they need, they can match that to the wealth of available APIs and get\ninformation quickly and efficiently, enabling them to serve customers\nthroughout the entire customer lifecycle, boosting retention, and keeping the\nlegitimate business as a customer for years to come.\n\n1 http://www.acg.net/synthetic-identity-fraud-cost-banks-6-billion-\nin-2016-auriemma-consulting-group/  \n2 https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/federal-register-\nnotices/customer-due-diligence-requirements  \n3 https://www.digitalbankingreport.com/dbr/dbr249/  \n4 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-\nservices/us-fsi-api-economy.pdf  \n5 https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/assets/pdf/technology2020-and-\nbeyond.pdf  \n6 http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/for-commercial-banks-a-better-\nroute-to-all-aboard.aspx\n\n_Thomson Reuters is not a consumer reporting agency and none of its services\nor the data contained therein constitute a \u2018consumer report\u2019 as such term is\ndefined in the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. sec. 1681\net seq.
