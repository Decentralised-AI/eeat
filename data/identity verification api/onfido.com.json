It's a\ncrucial step in customer onboarding for various sectors, including finance,\ntravel, mobility, and online marketplaces. This guide aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of ID verification, focusing on services, apps, and\nAPIs that make this process seamless and secure.\n\n## ID verification as a service\n\nID verification as a service is a cloud-based solution that allows businesses\nto integrate identity verification into their existing systems. This service\nis often provided by specialized ID verification companies that offer various\nsolutions like document verification, biometric analysis, and data\nverification.\n\n### Benefits of using ID verification as a service\n\n  * Scalability \u2014 the ability to meet varying levels of demand faster than internal teams can scale.\n  * Cost-effectiveness \u2014 ID verification as a service is typically AI-powered, so can provide lower-priced checks than manual teams.\n  * Compliance with regulations \u2014 ID verification as a service companies should seek certifications that enable them to meet varying regulations. For example, Onfido is ETSI TS 119 461 certified. \n\n## ID verification API\n\nWhether building a solution in-house or leveraging off-the-shelf SDKs,\nbusinesses will need to connect to an ID verification API to effectively\ningest and act on the results of identity verification. Onfido\u2019s API is based\non REST principles, using HTTP response codes and verbs, and token-based\nauthentication to give businesses the tools they need to automate complex\nlogic. Onfido\u2019s API can generate SDK tokens, create applicants for identity\nverification checks, create and retrieve Onfido Studio workflow runs, and much\nmore.\n\n## How to choose the right ID verification API\n\nChoosing the right ID verification API for your business is a critical\ndecision that can significantly impact your operations. There are several\nfactors to consider, including reliability, speed, and security features.\nBelow, we delve into each of these aspects to help you make an informed\nchoice.\n\n### Reliability\n\nWhen it comes to ID verification, reliability is paramount \u2013 every moment you\nare unable to retrieve and act on verification results is a moment you are\nlosing potential customers. You need an API that is both dependably available\nand reliably delivering accurate performance. Here are some questions to\nconsider:\n\n  * Does the API have a high uptime, ensuring it's available when you need it?\n  * Are there any backup systems in place to ensure continuous service?\n  * What is the error rate, and how does the API handle errors?\n\nIt's advisable to look for APIs that offer at least 99.9% uptime and have\nrobust error-handling mechanisms. Reading reviews and asking for\nrecommendations can also provide insights into the API's reliability, as can\nchecking a dedicated status page such as Onfido\u2019s.\n\n### Speed\n\nSpeed is another crucial factor, especially for businesses that require real-\ntime verification. Slow verification processes can lead to user frustration\nand abandoned transactions. Consider the following:\n\n  * What is the average response time of the API?\n  * Does the API support batch processing for bulk verifications?\n  * Are there any rate limits, and if so, do they meet your business needs?\n\nChoose an API that offers low-latency responses and can handle the volume of\nverifications you expect to conduct. If your business operates globally, also\ncheck if the API has multiple data centers to ensure fast response times\nworldwide.\n\n### Security features\n\nSecurity should never be compromised, especially when dealing with sensitive\npersonal information. Here's what to look for:\n\n  * Does the API use strong encryption methods for data transmission?\n  * Does the provider test their security in-house and externally through bug bounties?\n  * Does the API provider comply with relevant regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA?\n\nEnsure the API you choose uses industry-standard encryption protocols and\noffers secure authentication methods like API keys or OAuth. Compliance with\ndata protection regulations is also a must to avoid legal complications. For\nexample, Onfido is ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliant.\n\nBy carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose an ID verification API\nthat aligns with your business needs and offers a secure, fast, and reliable\nservice.\n\n## ID verification app\n\nMobile apps for ID verification are gaining traction for their convenience,\nuser-friendly interfaces, and the ability to perform checks on the go. These\napps, like Onfido\u2019s Smart Capture, utilize the smartphone's camera and other\nbuilt-in features to scan documents, capture biometric data, and provide real-\ntime results. Below, we explore some of the popular features in ID\nverification apps and why they matter.\n\n### Document scanning\n\nOne of the primary features of ID verification apps is document verification.\nThis feature allows users to capture images of identification documents like\npassports, driver's licenses, and social security cards. Here are some points\nto consider:\n\n  * Does the app offer auto-capture capabilities to ensure high-quality scans?\n  * Can it recognize and extract information from various types of documents?\n  * Is the scanning process quick and straightforward?\n\nLook for apps that offer intelligent document recognition and can\nautomatically capture the document when it's in focus. This ensures that the\nscans are clear and readable, which is crucial for accurate verification.\n\n### Biometric capture\n\nFace recognition adds an extra layer of security by matching the user's face\nwith the photo on their identification document. This biometric verification\nis particularly useful for confirming that the person providing the ID is its\nlegitimate owner. Consider the following:\n\n  * Does the app offer liveness detection to prevent spoofing?\n  * How accurate is the face matching algorithm?\n  * Is the process quick and non-intrusive for the user?\n\nChoose an app that offers advanced liveness detection features, such as\nrequiring the user to blink or turn their heads, to ensure that the face being\nscanned is that of a live person. The face matching algorithm should also be\nhighly accurate to prevent false positives or negatives.\n\n### Fast results\n\nThe ability to provide real-time results is a significant advantage,\nespecially for businesses that require immediate verification. Here's what to\nlook for:\n\n  * How quickly does the app return verification results?\n  * Does it offer a summary of the verification checks performed?\n  * Can the results be integrated into your existing systems?\n\nAn ideal ID verification app should quickly provide results, complete with a\nsummary of the checks performed and their outcomes. If you're using the app\nfor business purposes, ensure that it can integrate with your existing systems\nfor a seamless user experience.\n\nBy focusing on these key features, you can choose an ID verification app that\nnot only meets your needs but also provides a secure, fast, and user-friendly\nexperience.\n\n## Choosing the right ID verification service\n\nThe ID verification market is crowded with various companies offering a range\nof solutions, from APIs and apps to cloud-based services. While the core\nfunction remains the same\u2014verifying identities\u2014what sets these companies apart\nare the unique features they offer. Below, we delve into some of these top\nfeatures that make certain companies stand out in the ID verification\nindustry.\n\n### Global support\n\nOne of the key features to look for is the ability to support multiple types\nof identification documents around the world, so your business can seamlessly\nexpand.\n\n  * Does the company offer a wide range of document support?\n  * Can it handle documents in multiple languages?\n\nCompanies that offer multi-document support are generally more versatile and\ncan cater to a broader audience, making them ideal choices for businesses with\nglobal operations.\n\n### Advanced biometric analysis\n\nBiometric verification is becoming increasingly important in identity\nverification. This involves using facial recognition, fingerprint scanning,\nand sometimes even iris scanning.\n\n  * Does the company offer advanced biometric features?\n  * How secure and accurate are these biometric methods?\n\nCompanies that offer robust biometric analysis are generally considered more\nsecure and are better at preventing fraud. Onfido Motion is a-next generation\nbiometric liveness solution delivering seamless, secure, and inclusive\ncustomer verification. With a simple head-turn capture, businesses can\nautomate customer onboarding and assess more customers, more quickly and\nefficiently while significantly reducing their fraud exposure.\n\n### Certifications\n\nCertifications that enable the ID verification provider to operate and be\naccepted by regulators are important for regulated industries like financial\nservices, transportation, and gambling. When choosing a vendor it\u2019s important\nto assess:\n\n  * Does the company adhere to international compliance standards?\n  * Do they offer features that help your business stay compliant?\n\n### User experience\n\nThe ease with which end-users can go through the verification process is also\na significant factor. A complicated or time-consuming process can deter users.\n\n  * Is the user interface intuitive?\n  * Does the company offer a seamless verification experience across multiple platforms?\n\nA focus on user experience often translates to higher conversion rates and\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n### Scalability\n\nAs your business grows, your ID verification needs will also expand. The\nability to scale is a crucial feature.\n\n  * Can the service handle a growing number of verifications?\n  * Is it easy to integrate additional features or services?\n\nCompanies that offer scalable solutions can adapt to your growing needs,\nproviding long-term value.\n\nBy considering these top features, you can make an informed decision when\nchoosing an ID verification company that aligns with your business needs and\noffers a secure, efficient, and compliant service.\n\nWant to learn more about digital identity verification?\n\nDownload our report to discover how the identity verification landscape has\nshifted, what technologies are coming, and best practices for building\nworkflows and assessing vendors.\n\nGet the report\n\n## What is an online ID verification service?\n\nSimply put, Online ID verification services are web-based solutions that allow\nfor the verification of identities over the internet. Once performed face-to-\nface, ID verification is now overwhelmingly conducted remotely \u2014 these\nservices are used by regulated industries conducing KYC.\n\n### Advantages of online ID verification\n\n  * Accessibility \u2014 verification can be conducted at anytime, from anywhere. Potential customers do not need to travel to stores or branches to be verified.\n  * Speed \u2014 verification can be completed online in seconds, and result in faster access to products and services.\n  * Global reach \u2014 online ID verification services can accurately process thousands of global identity documents, something that\u2019s not feasible for in-store staff. \n\n## Verifiying ID: The final word\n\nID verification is an essential process for businesses that need to confirm\nthe identity of their customers or users.
