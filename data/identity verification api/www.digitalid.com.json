When the\nthree speeds first come into frame we hear the beeps in ascending order.\n\nVideo: A turquoise square appears on screen with the word 'Priority'.\n\nAudio: Priority\n\nVideo: A red street posting box quickly appears with a letter flying out of\nthe posting box into a postie's backback on his bike. The postie then rides\naway and a letter now appears in the middle of the screen with a hand coming\nin and placing a Priority label next to the stamp. The price appears\nunderneath the letter. 60c + 50c*.  \nAn Australia Post store pops up and this animation changes into a computer.\nThe computer turns into a calendar with the date 14 December, which then turns\ninto 4 January.  \nDisclaimer:  \n*Subject to ACCC and Ministerial notification processes\n\nAudio: To have your letters delivered within 1-4 business days, depending on\nthe destination, simply apply a Priority label next to your concession stamp.\nPriority labels will be available to purchase at your local Post Office or at\nauspost.com.au/shop from 14 December 2015 for use from 4 January 2016.  \nA sound for the letter flying.  \nA sound for the motorbike.\n\nVideo: A grey square appears on screen with the word 'Regular'.\n\nAudio: Regular\n\nVideo: The Regular letter then appears with the price 60c.  \nA hand appears holding the letter. The letter is then placed in a red street\nposting box. The letter flies out of the box into a postie's backpack on his\nbike.\n\nAudio: For the regular service, just apply a concession stamp as usual.\nDelivery of letters with only a concession stamp will take up to 2 business\ndays longer than the Priority service, depending on the destination.  \nSound for the letter being posted.  \nA sound for the letter flying.  \nA sound for the motorbike.\n\nVideo: The postie then rides away and the Concession stamp now appears in the\nmiddle of the screen. This turns into many stamps.\n\nAudio: The price of concession stamps will remain at $0.60 and MyPost\nConcession account holders can continue to purchase up to 50 concession stamps\nper year.  \nA sound plays for the purchase.  \nSounds play for the laptop keys.  \nPage turning sounds for the calendar.\n\nVideo: An Australia Post store then pops up with a red street posting box out\nthe front of it.  \nThe video ends with the Australia Post logo and a button which says \"Click\nhere if you have any questions\".\n\nAudio: Both Priority and Regular letters can be posted in red street posting\nboxes or at any Post Office.

The synergies between Airtasker\nand Australia Post is essentially trust. So on Airtasker, they've built a\nmarketplace that has two sides to it, and both sides need trust to be able to\ninteract with each other. And in a physical environment, that's quite easy -\nyou and I could talk to each other, build rapport and over time develop trust.\nIn a digital environment, it's actually quite hard, so they needed a way to\nsolve for that problem. I think the Digital iD Badge offers Airtasker\nbasically an enhanced level of trust in our platform, in our Taskers. So we've\nfound it quite simple, actually, to integrate our systems between Airtasker\nand Digital iD, and that's mainly because Digital iD follows industry best\npractices using OpenAuth to establish a trusted link between two systems. To\nintegrate with Digital iD was a really seamless process. We had a couple of\nworkshops with the iD team. The technology was very clearly set up and\ndocumented from the get-go. I think our engineers here found it really easy to\nwork with, and I think it's been one of our easier projects, one of our easier\nintegration projects. The problem that Airtasker was hoping to solve is a\nproblem that we've been solving for 200 years, and we've just helped them\nevolve into the digital space.  \n  \n\n##\n\nFind out more about Digital iD\u2122\n\nGet in touch\n\n####  Quicklinks  _ _\n\n  * Digital iD\u2122 for business \n  * Personal \n  * Developer \n  * Newsroom \n\n####  _ _\n\n  * Terms of use \n  * Privacy notice \n\nAustralia Post acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we\noperate, live and gather as \u200ba team.
