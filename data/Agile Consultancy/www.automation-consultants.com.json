Home\n  2. __Atlassian Products\n  3. __Atlassian Jira pricing\n\nAutomation Consultants\n\nAtlassian ProductsProducts\n\n30 August 2019\n\nAs an Atlassian partner and a consultant to multiple large private and public\nsector organisations around the UK, we understand the need to offer our\ncustomers Jira pricing options, including the ability to pay using a purchase\norder number, normal credit terms, or invoice.\n\nJira and the associated product range including Jira Software and Jira Service\nDesk have traditionally been purchased directly from Atlassian by payment in\nadvance. These Jira licenses and software were most commonly paid for via\ncredit card \u2013 useful for teams that want to move forward quickly, with the\nSaaS version of Jira to support issue tracking and project management.\n\nHowever, where this isn\u2019t possible, or when Jira is embraced throughout an\norganisation and a larger order is required, it is a benefit to be able to buy\nwith purchase order, invoice and regular credit terms. Our Jira software\npricing and flexible methods of payment allow for company-wide roll out,\nsomething which is a common occurrence, once one team proves successful.\n\nWith so many flexible payment options available and reasonable Atlassian Jira\npricing, your organisation could start reaping the benefits instantaneously.\nOur experts can deploy your Jira licenses and provide expert knowledge and\ntraining to support the smooth integration of the software.\n\nWhether it\u2019s 100 SaaS Jira users or 10,000 server based users, as an official\nJira partner you can purchase the licenses and applications through us, while\nalso benefiting from 15 years of software lifecycle knowledge, and project\nmanagement expertise.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more information about Jira service desk pricing, or\nwould like to learn more about Jira cost savings for your business, contact us\ntoday.\n\nClick here to find out more about:\n\nJira \u2013 issue management application \u2013 server or web based  \nJira Software \u2013 formerly Jira Agile \u2013 agile Jira project management  \nJira Service Desk \u2013 for all your service desk agents \u2013 service desk\n\nTalk to us today to discover how we can help you with your Jira pricing.\n\n80\n\n__Share on Facebook __Share on X\n\n##### Search\n\nShape\n\n##### Tags\n\n2024 agile agile at scale AI Appfox careers atlassian Atlassian cloud\natlassian cloud vs data center atlassian cloud vs server atlassian data center\nAtlassian Intelligence atlassian jira atlassian jira align atlassian managed\nservices atlassian server atlassian support atlassian team 22 atlassian trello\nazure boards Azure DevOps carbon offsetting cloud admin confluence confluence\ncloud DevOps Devops Live environment Events JFrog jira jira align jira align\nvs azure boards jira vs jira align managed hosting managed services microsoft\nazure boards migrate to atlassian cloud monday.com sales crm moretrees SAFe\ntempo tree planting trello why migrate to atlassian cloud\n\n##### Materials\n\nJira Align\n\n#### Unlock the agility of your enterprise\n\nDownload now __\n\n##### Recent Posts\n\n  * ###### Automation Consultants shortlisted for Partner of the Year Award\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n9\n\n1\n\n3\n\n  * ###### 3 Common Misconceptions of Scrum Masters\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n9\n\n1\n\n3\n\n  * ###### Agile Coaching: What Is It and Why Do You Need It to Build A Solid Agile Team?\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n\n  * ###### Join Us at DevOps Live and Try Your Hand to Crack the Safe!\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n##### Events\n\n30 April \u2013 2 May 2024\n\n#### Atlassian Team \u201924\n\nRegister now! __\n\n##### Social Links\n\n __ __ __\n\n## Continue Reading\n\n__\n\nPrevious post\n\nAtlassian Confluence\n\nNext post\n\nJira Services\n\n__\n\n##### **Related Posts**\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n9\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2024AIAtlassian ProductsNews And Blogs\n\n##### Atlassian Intelligence now Available: How Will You Use it?\n\n16 January 2024\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2023Atlassian ProductsITSMJira Service ManagementJSMNews And Blogs\n\n##### Jira Service Management vs BMC Helix ITSM\n\n6 October 2023\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2023Atlassian ProductsJiraNews And Blogs\n\n##### How to Use Jira as a Project Management Tool\n\n26 September 2023\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n9\n\n0\n\n2023Atlassian ProductsITSMJira Service ManagementJSMNews And Blogs\n\n##### Jira Service Management vs ServiceNow\n\n11 August 2023\n\nConsultancy\n\nAtlassian Consultancy\n\nDevOps\n\nCloud Solutions\n\nTraining\n\nManaged Services\n\nAtlassian Managed Services\n\nAtlassian Support\n\nAtlassian Cloud Admin\n\nAtlassian Managed Hosting\n\nProducts\n\nAppfox\n\nAtlassian Products\n\nOther Products\n\nAtlassian Marketplace\n\nAbout\n\nEvents\n\nCase Studies\n\nNews and Blog\n\nWe're hiring!\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n__ UK Registered Trading Address: Building 1420 Arlington Flex, Theale, RG7\n4SA\n\nCompany Number 04047568 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Automation Consultants Ltd.\n\n __ __ __ __\n\nClose __\n\nSearch\n\nHit enter to search or ESC to close\n\n__\n\nSearch for:\n\n__\n\n"
