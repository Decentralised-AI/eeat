We\nprovide Agile consultants for your staff augmentation needs as well as Agile\nmanagement consulting services for organizational assessments, roadmaps,\ntransformation and scalability. WEXGEN has practiced Agile since the inception\nof the Rational Unified Process (RUP) \u2013 Agile Modeling concepts in 2002.\n\n#### What is Agile?\n\nAgile is a philosophy encompassing multiple frameworks (e.g. Crystal, Extreme\nProgramming, Kanban, Lean, Scrum, Scrumban) that share a common set of values\nand principles. These frameworks are differentiated by their practical\napplications and approach to implementation.\n\n* * *\n\nAgile promotes a cooperative and collaborative effort between core teams,\nleaders, and user communities to provide continuous delivery of products,\nsoftware or services. Its structure embraces changing business needs, and\nmeasures progress and success through the production of well-designed and\nworking products. At the same time, closely managed product backlogs and\ntechnical debt decisions ensure the ultimate business goals and objectives are\nmet. Agile teams strive to maintain a consistent and sustainable pace while\nfrequently reflecting on how to become more efficient and effective.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Agile/Scrum Functions\n\nAcceptance Criteria  \nATDD, BDD, TDD  \nBacklog Grooming  \nBurndown Charts  \nContinuous Integration  \nContinuous Delivery  \nDaily Scrum\n\nRefactoring  \nScaled Agile Framework  \nScaling  \nScrum of Scrums  \nScrum Master  \nUser Stories  \nVelocity\n\nDefinition of Done  \nProduct Backlog  \nProduct Owner  \nRetrospective Reviews  \nSprints  \nSprint Backlog  \nSprint Planning  \nSprint Reviews  \n\n* * *\n\n## Is Agile Right for your Company?\n\nExperienced Agile organizations typically have notable success in delivering\nvalue to the customer, although it is important for new adopters to walk-\nbefore-running. A company should be open to continuous team interaction,\nincreased stakeholder involvement, simplifying process and documentation,\nevolving requirements, and embracing business change, or else the initiative\nwill likely fail.\n\nImplementing Agile practices not only impacts the development teams, it also\nrequires a new mindset and approach to governance, management, infrastructure,\nand operations. Organizational and team structure, project types, complexity,\nrisk landscape/tolerance, and stakeholder location/availability are all\nfactors to consider when choosing an Agile framework.\n\n* * *\n\n## How can WEXGEN help?\n\nWEXGEN delivers best-in-class Agile consulting services tailored to fit your\norganization\u2019s needs.
