Settle or go to Trial\n    * Auto Accidents Resources:\n\n## 1\\. Notice of Representation\n\nA person injured in a car wreck hires attorney, who will notify the Insurance\nCompany that you have retained an attorney.  This letter is called a Notice of\nRepresentation.  The main purpose of the letter is to prevent the insurance\ncompany from sending you letters or calling you. All communication will go\nthrough your attorney or take place in the presence of your attorney. If you\nare contacted by the insurance company, don\u2019t talk to them, just give them\nyour attorney\u2019s name and number.\n\n## 2\\. Gathering of Accident Facts\n\nWhile you are being treated by a doctor for your injuries, your attorney will\nbe gathering all the facts on the accident. He will gather witnesses, police\nreports, information on other drivers, photographs and medical records of your\ntreatment. When your medical treatment is done, the records will usually be\nprovided within a few weeks.\n\n## 3\\. Demand Package\n\nWhen all of your records and bills have been obtained, your attorney is in a\nposition to make a complete evaluation of your injuries and damages to send a\ndemand package to the insurance company.  Your attorney will demand a\nsettlement amount greater than what he feels your claim is worth.  Remember\nthat the settlement demand does not always reflect the true value of your\nclaim.  It is simply a starting point for negotiations.\n\n## 4\\. What is My Case Worth?\n\nThe short answer, probably not as much as you think.  Television and other\nnews media tend to exaggerate what people recover for car accident cases. It\nis not newsworthy when a person recovers a reasonable amount. Other sources of\nmisinformation are the \u201cStop Lawsuit Abuse\u201d organizations, whose mission is to\nlower the amounts juries award accident, victims.\n\nThey are not grass-root organizations, but well-organized ad campaigns\nfinanced by big business and the insurance industry, to convince the public\nthat accident victims receive too much money or are faking their injuries.  It\nis also common for friends, family or co-workers to give their opinions about\nwhat your claim is worth. This information is usually misleading and can be\nvery frustrating because it creates unrealistic expectations about what a\nclaim is really worth.\n\n## 5\\. Negotiating The Settlement with Insurance Company\n\nAfter the insurance company receives the demand package, it will be evaluated\nby an insurance adjuster. Adjusters have a certain amount of authority to\nsettle claims.  If the amount of the claim is higher than their authority,\nthey must go to a supervisor with more authority.\n\nThis whole process could take several months to complete.  Remember the\ninsurance adjuster, is trying to settle as quick and as cheap as possible\nbecause the insurance company is in the business to make money and pay as\nlittle or nothing if possible.\n\n## 6.   Settle or go to Trial\n\nIt is your decision whether to accept or reject a settlement offer.  You will\ndecide whether to take the money offered or go forward with litigation. You\nmust consider how much your time is worth.  A lawsuit can take up to two\nyears, and if you win the other side can appeal adding a couple more years to\nthe process.  How comfortable are you with taking risks.  A jury might award\nless or no money at all.  Further, the added cost of litigation may reduce the\namount of money received.\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, your time to report\nthe injury and make a claim is very limited.
