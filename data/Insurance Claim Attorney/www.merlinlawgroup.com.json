The guidance provided to\nus at every turn proved to be the difference. My recommendation is to let the\ninsurance company do their job but if they come up short, have the Merlin team\non speed dial and waste no time pressing the button for help.\n\nGary Wagner\n\n__________\n\nI have worked with Merlin for years.
