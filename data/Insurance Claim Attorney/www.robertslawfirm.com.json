We would all like to believe that insurance companies\nhave our best interests at heart, but unfair insurance practices are all too\ncommon. It is important to remember that insurance companies often try to\nminimize the amount of compensation you deserve. Keep in mind that payments\nreduce the cash reserves that insurance companies must keep. Maintaining those\ncash reserves costs the insurer money and can only be done by reducing profit\nor increasing premiums.\n\nAt Roberts & Roberts, we provide the legal counsel necessary for you to fully\nunderstand your legal rights under your insurance policy. Whether it is a car\naccident insurance claim or homeowner\u2019s insurance claim, our insurance claims\nattorneys are experienced, knowledgeable, and willing to provide you with the\nknowledge you need to get the most out of your claim.\n\nIf you have made a claim under an insurance policy and the insurance company\nis not being fair, you are going to need legal help. An experienced personal\ninjury attorney on the staff of Roberts & Roberts will fight for you when an\ninsurance company refuses your valid claim and impinges your legal rights\n\nContact us at 903-597-6000. The call costs you nothing \u2026 it could mean\neverything. All calls are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We will\ncome to you if you are disabled.

We\nnever want money worries to prevent injured people from getting the justice\nthey deserve. That\u2019s why we offer our clients a range of options when it comes\nto attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nWhile some clients prefer to pay an hourly fee or a flat fee, the vast\nmajority of our clients with personal injury and wrongful death cases find\nthat a contingency-fee (percentage) plan suits their needs best.\n\nOne of the main benefits of a contingency fee is that you, our client, don\u2019t\nhave to pay us anything up front. In fact, at Roberts & Roberts, you pay us\nnothing under a contingency-fee plan unless and until we recover compensation\nfor you on your claim. You will not owe us anything for attorney\u2019s fees, court\ncosts, or other legal expenses unless you are compensated.\n\nWhen you choose a contingency fee, the cost of your legal representation will\nbe paid out of your compensation based on a percentage that we agree on when\nyou become our client. This means that you do not have to worry about paying\nlegal bills while your case is pending. At Roberts & Roberts, we don\u2019t get\npaid until you do.\n\nOur attorneys will be glad to discuss with you in detail how contingent fees\nwork. We want to put your mind at ease about the financial aspects of your\nclaim. Your focus should be on recovering from your injuries or loss and\nputting your life back together.\n\nFind out how our Texas accident lawyers can help you. Contact us today at\n**903-597-6000 ** **** or fill out our online contact form. There is no charge\nfor the initial review.\n\nMost of the attorneys at Roberts & Roberts are board certified by the Texas\nBoard of Legal Specialization in personal injury law or civil trial law. We\nare proud of the extraordinarily high percentage of our current clients who\nwere recommended to us by our former clients. Call us. We can help.\n\nThe call costs you nothing \u2026 It could mean everything.\n\n## Free Case Review\n\nYou have nothing to lose by letting our attorneys advise you of your options.\nFor a **no-cost, confidential attorney** review of your case, contact us using\nthe form below or by calling us at **(903) 597-6000**.\n\nContact Us\n\nName *\n\nName\n\nFirst\n\nFirst\n\nLast\n\nLast\n\nPhone *\n\nEmail *\n\nWhat happened? *\n\nIf you are human, leave this field blank.\n\nSubmit Free Case Evaluation\n\n\u0394\n\n**From one former client:**  \n\"I am so happy to have chosen the best law firm around.
