We would all like to believe that insurance companies\nhave our best interests at heart, but unfair insurance practices are all too\ncommon. It is important to remember that insurance companies often try to\nminimize the amount of compensation you deserve. Keep in mind that payments\nreduce the cash reserves that insurance companies must keep. Maintaining those\ncash reserves costs the insurer money and can only be done by reducing profit\nor increasing premiums.\n\nAt Roberts & Roberts, we provide the legal counsel necessary for you to fully\nunderstand your legal rights under your insurance policy. Whether it is a car\naccident insurance claim or homeowner\u2019s insurance claim, our insurance claims\nattorneys are experienced, knowledgeable, and willing to provide you with the\nknowledge you need to get the most out of your claim.\n\nIf you have made a claim under an insurance policy and the insurance company\nis not being fair, you are going to need legal help. An experienced personal\ninjury attorney on the staff of Roberts & Roberts will fight for you when an\ninsurance company refuses your valid claim and impinges your legal rights\n\nContact us at 903-597-6000.
