In health insurance claim\ndisputes, not only are you saddled with the unique challenge of having to\nrecover from your injury or illness, but depending on the circumstances (e.g.,\nif your insurance provider makes a significantly undervalued offer or denies\nyour claim entirely), you could be left with significant bills.\n\nWhether your health insurance provider chooses to cover your treatment could\nspell the difference between bankruptcy and solvency \u2013 and in many cases the\ndifference between prompt treatment that can save a patient\u2019s life and an\nunknown future. The stakes in health insurance disputes are often rather high.\nIf your insurer acts in bad faith, you may therefore be entitled to recover\ndamages for emotional distress, among various other losses.\n\nAs a general rule, insurers are incentivized to avoid or minimize their\npotential liabilities, even when a policyholder clearly qualifies for benefits\nunder their coverage contract. By ramping up the administrative cost for the\npolicyholder, insurers can effectively reduce their benefits liabilities and\nundermine the ability of policyholders to challenge the legitimacy of their\nactions.\n\nSuccessful insurance litigation requires client-oriented legal representation\nfrom beginning-to-end of the process. At Berg Plummer Johnson & Raval, LLP,\nour Houston insurance coverage and litigation attorneys have decades of\ncombined experience representing policyholders against their insurers for\nwrongful denial, delay, missed payments, underpayment, and other issues\nentitling the claimant to challenge the decision of the insurer.\n\n## We Fight for Texas Healthcare Policyholders to Get the Compensation They\nDeserve\n\nWhen it comes to health insurance, an injured policyholder who requires\nsignificant medical treatment may find themselves in a situation where they\nare held hostage to the whims of their insurer. If an insurer denies your\nclaim, underpays your claim, or delays payment, you could be left in financial\nlimbo with no means with which to pay your medical bills. An experienced\nHouston health insurance lawyer can help you recover the compensation you\ndeserve.\n\nBerg Plummer Johnson & Raval, LLP is committed to helping policyholders obtain\ntheir rightful benefits. We represent clients in Houston and throughout Texas\nwho were wrongfully denied a health insurance claim or whose claims were\nunjustly delayed.\n\n## Why Hire a Houston Health Insurance Attorney?\n\nThough one may believe that their claims are covered by their insurance\npolicy, the insurer benefits a great deal from interfering with the payout.\nFor example, if an insurer wrongfully denies a health insurance claim, and the\npolicyholder decides not to challenge the denial (and potentially recovering\ndamages), then the insurer will effectively avoid a payout that they otherwise\nwould have had to honor.\n\nAs health insurance providers are naturally in conflict with their\npolicyholders, it is critical that policyholders take an active role in making\nsure their claims are fairly considered and processed by their insurance\nproviders. If the insurer fails to act in accordance with their duties under\nthe law, you should connect with an experienced Houston health insurance\nlawyer who can counsel you through the process of obtaining a favorable\nresolution.\n\n## Common Reasons for Insurance Claim Delays or Denial\n\nDifficulties in having an insurance claim processed and accepted can be\nrelated to, but are not necessarily limited, to:\n\n  * Category of treatment not covered (e.g., mental health issues not being covered by the existing healthcare plan)\n  * Treatment considered \u201cnot medically necessary\u201d\n  * Denial on the basis of incomplete evidence\n  * Administrative and clerical errors\n  * Delayed submissions\n  * Valuation of costs does not accurately reflect claim\n\n## Pre-Authorization Issues? We Can Help.\n\nIn some health insurance disputes, the policyholder may have failed to obtain\npre-authorization from the insurer before receiving treatment. Failure to\nobtain pre-authorization may result in a claim denial, but the denial will not\nnecessarily \u201cstick.\u201d If you can demonstrate that the treatment was necessary\nand would have been authorized by the insurer, then you may be able to\nsuccessfully challenge the denial.\n\nIf you have had your health insurance claims wrongfully denied, delayed,\nundervalued, or otherwise interfered with by the insurer, it\u2019s important that\nyou connect to a qualified health insurance attorney with a track record of\nsuccess in challenging the decisions of insurance providers and obtaining\nfavorable results. Depending on the terms of the coverage, your attorney may\nhave to re-file your claim, challenge the denial through an internal\nadministrative process, and eventually file a lawsuit in court and take your\ncase to trial.\n\n## Contact a Houston Health Insurance Lawyer at Berg Plummer Today\n\nStruggling with an insurance claim issue in Texas?
