Unfortunately, however, many insurance companies will deny\nrightful claims. Even if they don\u2019t reject your claim outright, they might\noffer a too-low settlement that doesn\u2019t even come close to covering your\ndamages.\n\nAt Howry Breen & Herman, we protect individuals, homeowners, business owners,\nranchers, and other people dealing with difficult insurance companies. We have\nhelped our clients through some of the worst natural disasters in our area,\nincluding devastating wildfires, floods, and storms.\n\nOur insurance litigation lawyers in Austin are experienced in helping our\nclients aggressively prosecute and resolve their claims so that they can start\nrebuilding their lives.\n\nIf you need help dealing with an insurance company or have had your just claim\ndenied, contact us online or by phone at (512) 430-4844. We offer free initial\ncase evaluations.\n\n### Types of Insurance Litigation We Handle\n\nAfter a natural disaster, unexpected injury, or commercial loss, insured\nindividuals typically turn to their insurance provider in an effort to recover\nsustained damages. Insurance companies have a duty to honor their policies and\npay out rightful claims.\n\nHowever, it is often in the insurance company\u2019s best interest to avoid paying\nout the full amount\u2014or any amount at all. At Howry Breen & Herman, we take on\ninsurance companies that seek to wrongfully devalue or deny policyholders\u2019\nclaims.\n\n**Our Austin insurance litigation attorneys can assist you with:**\n\n  * **Coverage Disputes:** In such cases, the insurance company and the policyholder disagree about what is covered under the current policy. Often, insurance companies try to exploit ambiguous policy language to avoid paying rightful claims. \n  * **Bad Faith Insurance Claims:** With bad faith claims, the policyholder argues that his or her insurance company has incorrectly or wrongfully estimated the amount of compensation he or she qualifies for. Insurance companies will often undervalue losses to avoid paying out the full amount a policyholder is owed. \n\nThis list is not exhaustive; our team can help you with any insurance dispute\nor litigation matter you may be facing. With nearly **25 years of jury trial\nexperience** and thousands of cases handled, we are equipped to take on even\nthe toughest of cases.\n\n### What Are Punitive Damages?\n\nWhen a defendant in a civil case harmed the plaintiff through criminal means\nor egregious negligence, the court can approve of punitive damages that\nfurther penalize them. In most cases, punitive damages are not an option\nbecause they are difficult to justify, and they are not covered by the\ndefendant\u2019s insurance provider. However, when dealing with insurance\nlitigation, the situation is different because the defendant _is_ an insurance\ncompany, not someone being represented by one.\n\nOur Austin insurance litigation attorneys can discuss your chances of securing\npunitive damages with you while your case develops. We want to give you a\nrealistic expectation based on the specifics of your case.\n\nAs mentioned, punitive damages are rare, so we won\u2019t mislead you into thinking\nyou are automatically eligible to receive them. On the other hand, if they\nwould be justified based on what the defendant did to mishandle your insurance\nclaim, then you can be confident that we will do what we can to pursue every\nlast penny of punitive damages.\n\n### Assisting All Types of Clients with Insurance Litigation\n\nUnfortunately, natural disasters, like fires and floods, are relatively common\nhere in Texas. At Howry Breen & Herman, we assist clients who have suffered\ndevastating property loss and other damages after a natural disaster.\n\nWe also help individuals dealing with difficult automobile insurers after a\ncar or motorcycle accident, as well as business owners who have had their\ncommercial insurance claim wrongfully denied.\n\n**Our insurance litigation lawyers have fought on behalf of:**\n\n  * Homeowners\n  * Small businesses\n  * Large corporations\n  * Farmers\n  * Ranchers\n  * Churches\n\nIn every instance, our goal is simple: to help you recover the full and fair\ncompensation you are owed. We rely on an aggressive approach to trial in order\nto help our clients achieve the best possible outcomes for their cases.\n\nWe have even helped clients recover legal fees from liable insurance companies\nin some cases. Our team can handle every aspect of your case so that you can\nfocus on moving forward with your life. We offer contingent fees, meaning you\ndon\u2019t owe us anything unless/until we win your case.\n\nCall (512) 430-4844 or fill out an online contact form to request a no-cost\nconsultation today.\n\n#### Practice Areas\n\n  * Personal Injury\n  * Business & Commercial Litigation\n  * Insurance Litigation\n  * Oil & Gas Litigation\n  * Real Estate Litigation\n\nOur Victories\n\n  * **$53.9 Million Verdict**\n\nHBH won a 53.9 million dollar verdict against Oncor Electric Delivery.\nFollowing a two-week trial, a Dallas jury has awarded $53.9 million in damages\nto victim James Stacey Taylor of Graham, Texas, after finding that actions by\nOncor, the state's largest electric delivery power company, caused the tragic\n2015 incident that left Mr. Taylor a quadriplegic.\n\nThe case is _Taylor v.
