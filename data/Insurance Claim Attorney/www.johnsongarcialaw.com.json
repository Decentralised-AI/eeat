Unfortunately,\nthere are often a lot of gray areas within insurance policy language and\ninsurance companies can, at times, try to use a manufactured interpretation to\ndeny your or your company\u2019s claim. At Johnson Garcia LLP, our **Houston\ninsurance attorneys** have handled disputed insurance claims for individuals,\nsmall businesses, and large corporations ranging from several thousand dollars\n\n\n\nCall us today at 832-844-6700 for a free case evaluation with an experienced\nHouston work injury lawyer.\n\nup to several hundred million dollars. We know how to get you your money.\n\n\n\nThe difference you can expect at Johnson Garcia LLP is knowledge of the\ninsurance industry. For over a decade, the **Houston insurance lawyers** of\nJohnson Garcia LLP were recognized as some of the industry\u2019s leading insurance\nlitigators. We have deep and varied experience litigating disputes involving\ninsurance policy interpretation for policies issued by U.S. domestic and\ninternational insurers, including those in London, Bermuda, and elsewhere.\n\n### Jump to a Topic:\n\n  * Why an Insurance Company Would Dispute a Claim\n  * You Have Rights\n  * Personal insurance dispute\n  * Commercial insurance dispute\n  * Small business insurance dispute\n  * Energy and marine insurance dispute\n  * Life insurance dispute\n\n### Why an Insurance Company Would Dispute a Claim\n\nInsurance disputes are fairly common. It\u2019s not unusual for disagreements to\narise regarding the amount of a claim or even the validity of a personal\ninjury liability or property/casualty claim. The insurance company may say\nthat the accident was avoidable, or that there are no medical records to\nindicate an injury, or that you had a pre-existing condition that is\nresponsible for your injuries.\n\nIn some cases, their refusal is valid. At the very least, you must have\nmedical records that prove your injuries. In other cases, a disputed claim is\nnothing but an attempt to save money by avoiding a legitimate claim. If you\ndon\u2019t know your legal rights, the insurer might be successful at undercutting\nyour benefits.\n\n#### You Have Rights\n\nState governments closely regulate the insurance industry. There are things\ninsurers can and cannot do when it comes to settling insurance claims. Of\ncourse, state laws governing insurance disputes can be complicated, and big\ninsurance companies are well-versed in skirting the law without breaking it.\nThat being said, you have rights, and it\u2019s important to know what they are.\n\n\n\nWhen you sign an insurance contract, the law expects that both parties will\nnegotiate in good faith. A promise of good faith and fair dealing in handling\nyour claims is part of the policy, even when not explicitly stated.\n\n\n\nWhen insurance disputes are handled in bad faith\u2014for example, when an\ninsurance company has misrepresented its policy, when it creates unnecessary\ndelays, or when it denies access to benefits for no good reason\u2014then you have\nthe right to seek legal redress. In other words, you have a right to a fair\nsettlement based on the terms of your particular insurance policy. If the\ninsurer denies your claim and refuses to provide an explanation, or if their\nreason clearly violates the policy or misrepresents the truth, then you should\nspeak with the experienced **Houston insurance disputes attorneys** at Johnson\nGarcia LLP. Let our expertise and inside knowledge work to your advantage.\n\n### What\u2019s the Nature of Your Insurance Dispute?\n\n##### Personal Insurance Dispute\n\nDisputes under personal lines policies can be time-consuming and distracting\nto your everyday life.

What percentage does a personal injury attorney get?\n\nMost personal injury attorneys work on a contingency fee basis, meaning they\nonly get paid a percentage if they win your case. The contingency fee\npercentage a personal injury attorney gets typically ranges between 30 and40\npercent (33 percent is most common). You can always try to negotiate a reduced\ncontingency fee, but there\u2019s no guarantee that an attorney will agree. Using a\ncontingency fee of 33 percent, here\u2019s an example of how a settlement offer\nwould be paid out: If you receive an offer of $100,000 from the other party\u2019s\ninsurance company, you\u2019ll receive $67,000 and your attorney will receive\n$33,000.\n\n2\\. What is the average cost of a personal injury lawyer?\n\nThe average cost of a personal injury lawyer depends on two factors:\n\n1\\. The settlement or compensation amount awarded in your case.  \n2\\. The contingency fee arrangement you signed when hiring the personal injury\nlawyer.\n\nFor example, if you receive a $100,000 settlement and you signed a contingency\nfee arrangement of 33 percent, your attorney will receive $33,000. This will\nbe the \u201ccost\u201d of your personal injury lawyer.\n\nBut remember, with a contingency fee arrangement, you only pay this \u201ccost\u201d if\nand after your attorney wins your case. There are no upfront costs of hiring a\npersonal injury lawyer and many even offer a free consultation to get started.\n\n3\\. Is it worth getting a personal injury lawyer?\n\nWhile you\u2019re not required to obtain legal services for your case, there are\nmany benefits that make it worth getting a personal injury lawyer.\n\nTo start, an experienced injury lawyer knows how to value your case and help\nensure that you receive the maximum amount of compensation. Most importantly,\nyour lawyer can manage the entire case process from start to finish, which\ntakes a lot of stress off your plate.\n\nFor example, your lawyer will communicate directly with the other party\u2019s\ninsurance company to reduce the risk of you making a mistake like saying the\nwrong things that can ruin your case.\n\nAnd remember, personal injury lawyers typically work on a contingency fee\nbasis, so there\u2019s no upfront costs or financial risk in working with an\nattorney.\n\n4\\. What type of cases do personal injury lawyers take?\n\nPersonal injury lawyers take on many types of cases, including:\n\n  * Car accidents\n  * Truck accidents/18-wheeler accidents\n  * Motorcycle accidents\n  * Bicycle and pedestrian accidents\n  * Insurance disputes\n  * Premises liability/Slip and fall accidents\n  * Wrongful death\n\n\n\nEach of these personal injury cases includes different forms.For example, a\ncar accident personal injury case can include drunk driving, distracted\ndriving, drowsy driving, or a hit-and-run.\n\nIf you suffered an accident, it\u2019s best to consult with a lawyer who has\nexperience with your specific type of personal injury case. You can check the\n\u201cPractice Areas\u201d page on a personal injury lawyer\u2019s website to see a list of\nthe types of cases they take.\n\n5\\. What is a good settlement offer?\n\nThe best settlement offer is the one that pays out the most money. However,\nthis amount will depend on: the severity and number of your injuries and\ndamages, the type of accident you suffered, and the accident evidence you have\nto back up your claim.\n\nFirst, your personal injury lawyer will take a look at the facts of your\naccident to determine the value of your case and how much is a good settlement\namount to ask from the insurance company. Then, they will work on your behalf\nto get you the best possible settlement offer.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to reach a good settlement offer with the insurance company,\nyour lawyer may take your case to court to pursue compensation.\n\n6\\. How is a settlement paid out?\n\nYour settlement can be paid out in two ways:\n\n  1. You\u2019ll receive a lump-sum check; or\n  2. You\u2019ll receive structured payments over a set period of time.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to pay your lawyer\u2019s contingency fee\npercentage (typically 33 percent) out of the settlement amount. Also, some\nsettlement amounts are subject to taxes andother restrictions.\n\nAfter you accept a settlement, you\u2019re required to sign a form that releases\nthe defendant and insurance company from any additional liability in\nconnection with your claim. This means that if you change your mind about the\nsettlement offer later on, you won\u2019t be able to go back and ask for more\nmoney. Only accept \u201cfinal payment\u201d when you\u2019re ready to close your claim for\ngood.\n\n7\\. How much does a personal injury claim cost?\n\nBecause most personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis, a\npersonal injury claim doesn\u2019t cost you anything upfront. The only time you\u2019ll\npay money is if your lawyer wins your case. At that point, the lawyer will\ncollect a percentage of your settlement money. The exact percentage (typically\n33 percent) should be outlined in the contingency fee agreement that you sign\nwhen you hire your lawyer.\n\nAlthough you don\u2019t pay anything upfront, your lawyer will take on a variety of\nexpenses with the goal of winning your case. These expenses include\nadministrative work for handling your accident claim documents, collecting\nstrong evidence, and hiring experts to support your case against the insurance\ncompany.\n\n8\\. How do I hire a good personal injury lawyer?\n\nWith so many personal injury lawyers to choose from, making sure you hire the\nright one can be challenging. Here are some steps you can take to make a more\nconfident decision:\n\n  1.     1. Visit an attorney\u2019s website to see if they handle your type of case.\n    2. Read online reviews on Google to see what previous clients have to say.\n    3. Contact the law firm directly to ask questions about how their process works.\n    4. Ask friends and/or family if they have any recommendations.\n\nFinally, the most important thing you should do is to carefully review the\ncontract agreement when hiring the lawyer. This agreement will include\ninformation on the terms and conditions of your arrangement, including how\nmuch money the lawyer will take from your settlement amount.\n\n9\\. How much money can you sue for pain and suffering?\n\nThe compensation you can get for pain and suffering depends on the\ncircumstances of your case and the severity of your injuries. The court may\nuse what\u2019s called the \u201cmultiplier method\u201d to calculate the exact amount of\ncompensation for pain and suffering.\n\nUsing this method, the court will take the amount of your economic damages,\nlike loss of income and medical bills, and multiply this total by a number\nbetween 1.5 and 5. The number represents the severity of your injuries, from\nminor to severe.\n\nFor example, if you have $15,000 in economic damages and the judge decides to\nuse a multiplier of 2 because your injuries are moderate, you would receive a\ncompensation total of $45,000: $15,000 for your economic damages plus $30,00\n($15,000 multiplied by 2) for pain andsuffering.\n\n10\\. When should I hire a personal injury lawyer?\n\nIt\u2019s best to hire a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible. Don\u2019t attempt\nto tackle the complicated claims process on your own. There are many steps to\ntake after an accident: seeking medical attention, finding witnesses,\nobtaining medical records, getting a copy of the police report, filing a claim\nwith the insurance company, and more. It\u2019s too easy to make one small mistake\nthat can damage your claim and potential settlement.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that you leave this process to an experienced personal injury\nlawyer who knows all the tricks and challenges when dealing with the insurance\ncompany. Your lawyer will focus on pursuing maximum compensation while you\nfocus on your physical recovery.\n\nRemember, since most personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis,\nthere are no upfront costs when you hire a lawyer so there\u2019s no financial risk\nto you.\n\n11\\. How is pain and suffering damage calculated?\n\nThere are two basic methods for calculating pain and suffering damage:\n\n  1.  **Multiplier method:** The court will multiply the total amount of your economic damages (medical bills, car damage) by a number between 1.5 and 5. This number represents the severity of your injuries, from minor to extreme.\n  2.  **Per diem method:** Your pain and suffering damages are calculated on a \u201cper day\u201d basis between the date of your injury and the date when your doctor releases you from treatment. So if the court assigns you a per diem amount of $110 per day and it takes you 100 days to recover from your injuries, you\u2019ll get $11,000 for pain and damages.\n\n12\\. What are the 3 types of damages?\n\nThe three types of damages in a personal injury claim are:\n\n  1.  **General damages:** These damages provide compensation for non-economic losses, such as pain and suffering and long-term emotional distress.\n  2.  **Special damages:** These damages provide compensation for direct financial loss, such as medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage.\n  3.  **Punitive damages:** These damages are awarded to the victim as a way of punishing the at-fault person for their extremely negligent or reckless behavior.\n\nThe details of your personal injury case will determine which of the three (3)\ntypes of damages you can seek, and how much money you can expect to receive\nfor each type.\n\n13\\. What qualifies as a personal injury?\n\nThere are many types of personal injuries you can suffer, but not all of them\nwill qualify you to file a personal injury claim.\n\nThe phrase \u201cpersonal injury\u201d refers to an injury suffered as the result of an\naccident, such as a car crash, a slip and fall, or pedestrian accident.\n\nCommon examples of a personal injury include:\n\n  * Traumatic brain injury, such as bleeding in the brain.\n  * Broken bones.\n  * Deep cuts.\n  * Burns.\n  * Soft tissue injuries.\n  * Loss of limb.\n\nIf you experience an accident, never assume that you\u2019re okay, even if you\ndon\u2019t feel any pain in the moment. It\u2019s important to seek immediate medical\nattention in case you have severe internal injuries.\n\nDelayed or invisible injuries can take days, weeks, or months to appear.\nSeeking exams immediately after your accident will help you prove your\ninjuries and demand full compensation for them through a personal injury\nclaim.\n\n14\\. What qualifies as a personal injury case?\n\nIn order to qualify for a personal injury case, you must be able to prove that\nthe other person\u2019s negligent actions (like if they were driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol or speeding through a red light) caused your accident and\ninjuries. This is called \u201cburden of proof\u201d, because it\u2019s up to you or your\nlawyer to prove that the other person was responsible.\n\nTo prove this, you will need to provide strong evidence, including your\nmedical records, accidentphotos or videos, witness statements, and the police\nreport. If you don\u2019t have this evidence or it\u2019s too weak, a lawyer may decide\nyour accident does not qualify as a strong personal injury case.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where you stand, it\u2019s important to consult with a\nknowledgeable lawyer who can evaluate the facts of your accident and whether\nit qualifies as a good personal injury case.\n\n15\\. What is included in a bodily injury claim?\n\nA bodily injury claim is a request for compensation related to physical\ninjuries suffered in an accident.\n\nBodily injury claims typically cover lost wages and medical expenses. In most\ncases, they\u2019re paid by the at-fault driver\u2019s insurance company or your\ninsurance company.\n\nTo obtain compensation for a bodily injury claim, you must do the following:\n\n  * Receive immediate medical attention.\n  * Keep your medical records.\n  * Follow the treatment schedule outlined by your doctor.\n  * Take photos of the accident scene and your injuries.\n  * Collect other accident evidence like witness statements or video footage.\n  * Consult with an experienced personal injury lawyer.\n\n16\\. What is the difference between bodily injury and personal injury?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to confuse the difference between bodily injury and personal injury:\n\u201cpersonal injury\u201d is a type of claim that you can file against someone, while\n\u201cbodily injury: describes a type of damage that you can receive compensation\nfor in a personal injury claim.\n\nIn other words, personal injury is a type of civil claim filed against the\nnegligent party responsible for causing your accident and injuries. Bodily\ninjury is the physical damage sustained in an accident, such as broken bones,\na brain injury, or paralysis.\n\nThe phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d also refers to a specific type of auto insurance\ncoverage.\n\n17\\. How do you win a personal injury claim?\n\nEvery personal injury case is different, so there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all\napproach to winning a personal injury claim. However, there are basic steps\nthat can position you for success:\n\n  1. Receive immediate medical treatment to determine the extent of all your injuries.\n  2. Collect evidence from the scene of the accident like photos or video.\n  3. Maintain good records, such as medical records, medical bills, and conversations with insurance companies.\n  4. Hire an experienced personal injury lawyer to negotiate with the insurance company.\n  5. Don\u2019t accept a first settlement offer from the insurance company.\n\nThese basic steps will help you win a personal injury claim and maximize the\namount of compensation you may receive.\n\n18\\. How long does it take to get money from a settlement?\n\nIf your lawyer wins your personal injury case, how long it takes to get money\nfrom a settlement will vary, but you can generally expect to receive\ncompensation within six to eight weeks.\n\nIn most cases, your lump-sum payout is sent to your attorney first, who will\nprocess the funds based on your contingency agreement. After your lawyer takes\nout his percentage (typically 33 percent), along with any legal costs of\nhandling your case, what\u2019s left of the money will be sent to you.\n\nIf you are in line to receive a large sum of compensation, the money may\narrive based on a structured settlement schedule rather than a lump-sum check.\n\n## Serving Clients in Houston\n\nHouston is the largest, most diverse city in Texas, with a global economy and\nworld-class culture.
