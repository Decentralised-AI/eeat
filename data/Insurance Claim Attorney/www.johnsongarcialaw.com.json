We know how to get you your money.\n\n\n\nThe difference you can expect at Johnson Garcia LLP is knowledge of the\ninsurance industry. For over a decade, the **Houston insurance lawyers** of\nJohnson Garcia LLP were recognized as some of the industry\u2019s leading insurance\nlitigators.

It\u2019s not unusual for disagreements to\narise regarding the amount of a claim or even the validity of a personal\ninjury liability or property/casualty claim. The insurance company may say\nthat the accident was avoidable, or that there are no medical records to\nindicate an injury, or that you had a pre-existing condition that is\nresponsible for your injuries.\n\nIn some cases, their refusal is valid. At the very least, you must have\nmedical records that prove your injuries. In other cases, a disputed claim is\nnothing but an attempt to save money by avoiding a legitimate claim. If you\ndon\u2019t know your legal rights, the insurer might be successful at undercutting\nyour benefits.\n\n#### You Have Rights\n\nState governments closely regulate the insurance industry. There are things\ninsurers can and cannot do when it comes to settling insurance claims. Of\ncourse, state laws governing insurance disputes can be complicated, and big\ninsurance companies are well-versed in skirting the law without breaking it.\nThat being said, you have rights, and it\u2019s important to know what they are.\n\n\n\nWhen you sign an insurance contract, the law expects that both parties will\nnegotiate in good faith. A promise of good faith and fair dealing in handling\nyour claims is part of the policy, even when not explicitly stated.\n\n\n\nWhen insurance disputes are handled in bad faith\u2014for example, when an\ninsurance company has misrepresented its policy, when it creates unnecessary\ndelays, or when it denies access to benefits for no good reason\u2014then you have\nthe right to seek legal redress. In other words, you have a right to a fair\nsettlement based on the terms of your particular insurance policy. If the\ninsurer denies your claim and refuses to provide an explanation, or if their\nreason clearly violates the policy or misrepresents the truth, then you should\nspeak with the experienced **Houston insurance disputes attorneys** at Johnson\nGarcia LLP. Let our expertise and inside knowledge work to your advantage.\n\n### What\u2019s the Nature of Your Insurance Dispute?\n\n##### Personal Insurance Dispute\n\nDisputes under personal lines policies can be time-consuming and distracting\nto your everyday life.
