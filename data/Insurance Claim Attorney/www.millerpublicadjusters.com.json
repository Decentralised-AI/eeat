You might believe that it's the\neasiest way to get the money you deserve, but it\u2019s not that simple. Before you\nhire an insurance claim attorney to represent your interests, you should ask\nyourself these questions.\n\n### **1- Why have we reached an impasse?**\n\nWhen you\u2019re trying to negotiate a property damage insurance claim, several\ntypes of disputes occur.\n\n  * **Damage issues** : The adjuster and you disagree on what is damaged, the extent of the damage, whether or not your property should be repaired or replaced, or what it should cost.\n  * **Coverage problems** : The company denies coverage for your entire claim or for areas of damage you feel should be covered.\n  * **Bad faith** : Many wrongful acts committed by insurance companies and adjusters can be considered bad faith: Failure to pay your claim even after you've supplied a \u201cproof of loss\u201d and the documentation they requested. Offering a low settle to save claim dollars. Denying coverage without a legitimate reason.\n\n### **2- Can an attorney help me?**\n\nYou need an insurance claim attorney to file a bad faith or coverage lawsuit,\nbut an attorney will probably be of limited use when your dispute is about\ndamages. Of course, any attorney can try to negotiate your claim, but\neffective property claim negotiation requires property claim expertise. Your\nattorney is not likely to have a working knowledge of damage cause and origin,\nproperty estimates, building restoration, loss of use, insurance coverage and\nother property claim evaluation issues.\n\nAfter negotiation, a lawsuit is an attorney's go-to move, but Homeowners\npolicies prohibit lawsuits over damage disputes. The \"Appraisal\" provision\nrequires that you and your insurance company hire \u201cimpartial appraisers\u201d to\nevaluate your damage independently and try to work out an agreement.\n\n### **3- What happens if I do file abad faith or coverage lawsuit?**\n\nLitigation is a long and tedious process. Once your attorney files your\npaperwork, it can take years to get through the formal depositions, document\nproduction, evidence presentations, court-ordered conferences, and maybe a\ntrial one day. After years of procedural entanglements, there\u2019s no guarantee\nthat you will win.\n\n### **4- Can I resolve my dispute any other way?**\n\nAs many claim disputes involve damage evaluation and claim payments, there are\nmore efficient ways to resolve them.\n\n**Reopen negotiations** : Try sitting down with the property claim adjuster to\ncalmly work out your differences. If the adjuster won\u2019t talk, go up the chain\nof command until someone is willing to give you a line-by-line explanation of\nthe points of dispute and what you can do about them. If you both keep an open\nmind, you can resolve your differences.\n\n**File a complaint** : If your insurance company isn't paying what they owe\nand you can\u2019t get the adjuster to reopen negotiations, file a complaint with\nyour state department of insurance. The process can often be completed online.\nWhen the insurance commissioner\u2019s staff contacts your insurance company, they\nhave to explain themselves. The process often nudges insurers back to the\nnegotiation table.\n\n**Hire a Public Adjuster**: A public adjuster addresses coverage and damage\nissues as they arise. They can negotiate your settlement and achieve a better\noutcome because they know as much or more about damages and insurance policies\nas insurance company adjusters. In fact, many PAs have extensive insurance\ncompany claim training and backgrounds.\n\n\n\n### We Can Help\n\n**Miller Public Adjusters currently serves the states of**  \nWisconsin - Florida \\- Illinois \\- Indiana \\- Michigan \\- Minnesota \\- Texas\n\nCall us 24 hours a day at (866)978-9212 to schedule an appointment or  \nplease fill out a Free Claim Review to see if we can help.\n\n######  David Miller\n\nThank you for visiting us.
