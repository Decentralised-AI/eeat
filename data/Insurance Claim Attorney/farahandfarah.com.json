Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t\nalways the case. If insurance denies your claim or is dealing with you\nunfairly, it is both frustrating and confusing \u2013 especially if you feel that\nyour insurance claim denial was an incorrect decision.\n\nPlay Video about Attorney Eddie Farah standing before an orange background\nwith a graphic of a fire icon pictured on the right\n\nHome \u00bb Insurance Dispute Lawyers\n\nIn those cases, it\u2019s important to appeal an insurance decision as quickly as\npossible.

And while this is never an ideal situation, it\u2019s not uncommon,\nwhich is why having an experienced team of insurance dispute attorneys\nfighting for your rights is crucial.\n\nDepending on the situation, a \u201cpolicyholder\u201d may be an individual or group of\npeople, a business, or even people in a certain class, such as an individual\npolicyholder\u2019s family members. Some common subjects of first-party claims\ninclude:\n\n  * Health insurance\n  * Personal injury protection as part of an auto policy\n  * Underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage as part of an auto policy\n  * A homeowner\u2019s property damage claim\n  * Renter\u2019s insurance\n\nTypically, what you might be able to recover from a first-party claim is\ndetailed in a specific contract with your insurance company. If their\ninsurance claim denial violates that contract, then the insurer may be subject\nto a host of penalties on top of what they owe you for the initial claim.\nHowever, these contracts are usually complex and can use confusing language.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to work with an insurance claim attorney if you feel\nlike your insurance provider is not sticking to their end of the bargain.\n\n## The Benefits of Hiring an Attorney for Insurance Claims\n\nHiring an insurance claim attorney is important so you have an experienced\nvoice in your corner.
