Instead, you are holding their insurance company\naccountable. (That's the whole point of insurance!) Lawyers who sue insurance\ncompanies know the ins and outs of these cases - as well as the tricks used by\neach individual insurance company. They can help you reach a fair settlement\nand get your life back on track after an accident. When a valid claim is\npresented, you expect an insurance company to uphold its promises and put a\nprompt payment in your pocket. But don\u2019t get your hopes up. Despite their\nconstant promises to be a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d or that \u201cyou are in good hands,\u201d\nplenty of insurance companies are difficult and stubborn. They may refuse to\npay a legitimate claim. One thing to keep in mind: insurers are corporations.\nJust like Walmart, Ford, or other major corporations, insurance companies are\nout to make money for **_themselves_** , not to protect you or other\npolicyholders. Often, this selfish approach leads to complications, delays,\nand denials of your claim. This is true no matter what types of insurance\npolicies you\u2019re dealing with. Policyholders can be individuals, small\nbusinesses, or large corporations. As anyone involved in an insurance dispute\nknows, it\u2019s hard to get paid what you deserve. The insurance process is often\na roller coaster of empty promises, complications, and attempts at\nmanipulation by adjusters. Even for an experienced insurance claims law firm,\nit often takes many rounds of negotiations before the insurer will make a fair\noffer. Without the right law firm, the process can seem hopeless. Fortunately,\nassistance with your insurance claim is right under your nose! Stewart Guss\nand his team of attorneys regularly assist clients with different types of\ninsurance claims. With over 20 years of experience, we\u2019ve seen it all. Call us\nright now for a FREE consultation at 866-501-2189, or CLICK HERE to send us a\nquestion or get more information about your potential case. Below are some of\nthe insurance claims our law firm typically handles.\n\n## **Car Accident Claims**\n\nIn Texas, Insurance claims from traffic accidents are some of the most common.\nConsider the following statistics for Texas and Harris County, reported by the\nTexas Department of Transportation (TxDOT):\n\n  * 265,431 people suffered injuries in Texas crashes in just one year\n  * 17,602 people suffered serious injuries across the state\n  * Texas saw 3,794 traffic-related fatalities\n  * Harris County had 112,888 crashes reported\n  * Those crashes caused 33,140 \u201cpossible injuries,\u201d 12,028 non-incapacitating injuries, 2,268 \u201csuspected serious\u201d injuries, and 447 fatalities\n\nThat\u2019s more than one death on the road per day, in just **one** county. When\nyou think about how many people who suffer injuries in car accidents in the\nHouston area, it\u2019s no surprise how many car accident insurance claims are\nfiled. Some specific types of claims include: **Claims against other\ndrivers:** Many car accidents involving two vehicles happen because one driver\nwas negligent in some way. Our law firm can identify when another driver\nshould be liable for your injuries and losses. Furthermore, we can help\nrelieve some of your stress by handling the filing of a claim with that\ndriver\u2019s auto insurance policy. Auto insurance companies won\u2019t simply accept\nyour side of the story and pay. Instead, your car accident attorney will have\nto work to prove liability on the part of the other driver. The insurer will\noften try to limit liability by claiming you were at least partially at fault\nfor the crash. We know how to combat these allegations and seek the full\namount you deserve from the negligent driver\u2019s insurance company. **Uninsured\nmotorist claims:** Not every driver carries the minimum insurance that Texas\nlaw requires. In this case, a driver may decide to leave the scene of the\naccident to avoid responsibility, leaving you as the victim of a hit and run\nwithout any insurance information. If you find yourself in this unfortunate\nsituation, you can still file a claim with your own uninsured motorist policy.\nMany people think that because they pay their premiums on time, their own\ninsurance company will be more cooperative. However, **any** insurance company\ncan be difficult, whether it is yours or another driver\u2019s. This can be\nparticularly frustrating, but our firm regularly helps clients with uninsured\nmotorist claims navigate their personal auto insurance policies and come out\non top. **Rideshare accidents: **Many people use rideshare companies like Uber\nand Lyft to get around the Houston area. While these services are convenient,\nrideshare drivers can get in accidents just like any other driver. Whether you\nare an Uber or Lyft passenger or in another vehicle hit by a rideshare driver,\nyou may need to file an insurance claim to recover for your losses. Rideshare\ndrivers should have their own personal auto insurance policies. However, if a\ndriver has inadequate insurance or the policy refuses to cover a specific\naccident, **Uber and Lyft each have $1 million insurance policies** covering\ndrivers who are actively engaged in a ride, i.e. picking up a passenger or\ntransporting a passenger for their app. These accidents may require a claim\nwith the corporation\u2019s insurance, or even multiple insurance claims. A skilled\ninsurance claims lawyer will know how to handle these complicated claims and\nseek compensation for Uber and Lyft accident victims.\n\n## **Truck Accident Claims**\n\nAccidents involving commercial trucks can be particularly dangerous and may\nresult in severe injuries. Multiple parties may also be held liable: even if a\ntruck driver caused a crash, the driver\u2019s employer may be strictly liable for\nthe negligence of its employee. This means you might file claims with the\ndriver\u2019s individual auto policy _as well as_ the trucking company\u2019s corporate\npolicy. Sound difficult? It is. Trucking companies have insurance companies\nand lawyers ready to fight against liability at all costs. They have their own\ninvestigators who will try to prove that _you_ were responsible for the\naccident in order to avoid paying you. This is why you need the expertise of a\nseasoned attorney on your side, every step of the way.\n\n## **Premises Liability Claims**\n\nNot all accidents happen on the road. You can suffer serious injuries while\ngrocery shopping, browsing at the mall, or visiting another large store,\nrestaurant, hotel, or establishment. When these businesses do not address\nhazards on their premises, visitors and customers can get hurt, and the\ncompany should cover the costs of their injuries. Whether you suffered a slip\nand fall accident, a fall down the stairs, a swimming pool accident, or any\nother incident on a company\u2019s premises, there could be an insurance battle in\nyour future. You may think that a company and its insurer will own up to its\nwrongdoing and want to make the situation right. This is usually not the case.\nTake, for example, how Walmart handles slip and fall claims. The company has\nits very own insurance company, Claims Management, Inc., devoted to handling\n**only** claims against Walmart. The company\u2019s entire goal is to **limit**\nWalmart\u2019s liability for accidents that happen in-store. If they go through the\neffort of forming their own company for this purpose, you can imagine what\ntype of fight they will put up during your claims process! Premises liability\nclaims against companies are no easier than traffic accident claims.\nRegardless of what type of insurance claim is in your future, expect the\nunexpected. To ensure the best outcome possible and to limit your stress, call\nour Houston insurance claim law firm for help **before** you file your claim.\n\n## **Obstacles You Might Face During the Insurance Process**\n\nEven when you are well-prepared, the insurance process is rarely\nstraightforward. Instead, there are hiccups and obstacles at every turn. Many\ninsurance companies do this on purpose to frustrate claimants and drive them\nto accept a low settlement just to \u201cget it over with.\u201d After all, when you\u2019re\nhealing from an injury, the last thing you want is to constantly grapple with\ninsurance adjusters! The following are some possible obstacles you may face\nafter filing an insurance claim:\n\n  * **The insurance adjuster wants you to give a recorded statement about what happened and your condition.** You should _never_ do this. Be aware that insurance adjusters do not have the right to a recorded statement from you unless litigation is already in process. Insurance companies will stoop to taking your statements out of context to use against you and limit your claim. It is always better to have a lawyer handle all communications for you.\n  * **The adjuster claims you are responsible for your accident.** Many insurance adjusters will use any information possible (see above) to insinuate that you were also at fault for your own injuries. In many cases, people don\u2019t know how to fight these assertions or how to proceed. Our legal team regularly fights allegations of negligence regarding our clients. Additionally, under Texas law, even if you were 49% responsible for an accident, you still have the right to receive at least some compensation from the party that was 51% responsible.\n  * **The adjuster questions the value of your claim.** Often, insurance adjusters will approve certain damages you claimed but will refuse to pay others. They may justify a reduction in your claim by stating your injuries didn\u2019t all result from the accident, that you didn\u2019t need to miss as much work as you did, or that you didn\u2019t need all the medical treatment you received. Our legal team is skilled at proving the severity and effects of all of your accident-related injuries in order to maximize your settlement.\n  * **The adjuster makes a lowball offer.** Almost every insurance company will start with a ridiculously low offer on the off-chance that you actually accept it. Always have your lawyer review a settlement offer before you accept _anything_.\n\nFacing obstacles like these in the insurance process is _much_ easier with the\nright legal team on your side. Our experienced lawyers and legal professionals\ncan help in many ways, guiding you through every step of your insurance claim.\n\n## **Why Choose Our Team?**\n\nInsurance companies will try every trick in the book to avoid making payouts.\nSo who do you turn to for help? It\u2019s important to remember that not all law\nfirms have the same experience and values when it comes to handling insurance\nclaims. Some law firms will push clients to accept any offer so they can\nresolve a greater number of cases in a shorter period of time. These so-called\n\u201csettlement mills\u201d don\u2019t always focus on what\u2019s best for the client. Instead,\nthey want to get clients in and out the door as fast as possible\u2026 which rarely\nresults in a fair settlement.
