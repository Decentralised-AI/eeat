By purchasing insurance, you\u2019ve\nalready protected you and your family, and trust that your insurance providers\nwill follow through with their agreed-upon side of the contract in emergency\nsituations. Insurance providers acting in bad faith can greatly affect you and\nyour family, and there is nothing more frustrating than feeling as though your\ninterests are not properly represented in times of need.\n\nContact Us\n\n## Insurance Lawyer: Our Approach\n\nDavis Law Group believes that insurance providers should always follow through\npromptly and thoroughly for their plan-holders. Our team wants you to receive\nthe compensation you deserve without having your claim wrongfully short-\nchanged, delayed, or denied. We\u2019re experts at the complex law that pertains to\ninsurance. Our attorneys will help gather all of the proper documentation\nnecessary for an effective suit, and mediate litigation in its totality, even\nagainst larger provider entities.\n\nContact Us\n\n### Examples of Bad Faith Insurance Practices\n\n#### Denying Payments Without Reasonable Basis\n\n01\n\nAfter an agreed-upon contract is signed, insurance companies cannot legally\ndeny claims that are outlined as part of your coverage within a policy. While\nsituations are dependent on your coverage and the specific wording of\ndocumentation as it pertains to your situation, a denial may qualify as an\ninsurance provider acting in bad faith.\n\n#### Discounting Payments Without Reasonable Basis\n\n02\n\nWhen a situation arises that requires payout from an insurance provider, a\nclaim must be submitted. Insurance companies often offer less money than a\nclaim is worth to increase their profit margin. When this doesn\u2019t cover all\nyour damages, despite paying enough for reasonable coverage within your\npolicy, legal action may be necessary.\n\n#### Delaying Payments Without Reasonable Basis\n\n03\n\nDuring payouts, policyholders have a right to receive payment in a timely\nmanner. In order to deter policyholders from pursuing compensation, insurance\ncompanies will delay both the payment and the process for achieving it. This\ncan impose great financial hardships upon those who need promised benefits\nimmediately.\n\n#### Failing to Affirm/Deny Coverage Within Reasonable Time\n\n04\n\nInsurance companies may take an unreasonable amount of time to investigate a\nclaim, far before agreeing to or denying payout. Much like payment delays,\nthis tactic is done in hopes of persuading policyholders to give up pursuit of\ncompensation. This, in turn, increases insurance company profit margins at the\npolicyholder's expense.\n\n#### Failing to Conduct Investigations\n\n05\n\nInsurance companies must operate under the concept of good faith on behalf of\ntheir policyholders, acting in their best interest under all circumstances.\nThis includes investigating claims that require compensation or payout quickly\nand thoroughly, to refrain from putting financial or emotional stress on a\npolicyholder. Avoiding investigation often means avoiding payment, which is\nillegal and immoral.\n\n#### Misrepresenting Law or Policy Language\n\n06\n\nInsurance coverage comes with a lot of paperwork, often littered with jargon\nthat is difficult to understand. Misrepresenting law or policy language\nincludes failure to disclose the existence of coverage that may be under your\nplan in order to avoid paying you. Failing to disclose claim filing deadlines\nand not providing the paperwork necessary are also included.\n\n### Insurance Lawyer FAQs\n\nQ1.\n\nWhat does good faith mean in insurance?\n\nGood faith is an implied duty of acting in a policyholder\u2019s best interest and\nengaging in fair dealing. More specifically, the action of conducting prompt\nand thorough investigations and payments in response to a policyholder\u2019s claim\nis expected.\n\nQ2.\n\nHow do I file a bad faith claim against an insurance company?\n\nFirst and foremost, review any insurance contracts held with the insurance\ncompany to reaffirm that misconduct has occurred. Keep logs of any claims made\nas well as any insurance provider responses, including delays or denials.\nBring all documents to an attorney, and we\u2019ll help initiate a lawsuit.\n\nQ3.\n\nWhat types of damages are available in bad faith insurance lawsuits?\n\nPayouts for bad faith insurance lawsuits may include the amount expected from\nthe original claim and attorney fees. Additional compensation for financial\nharm that resulted from the bad faith delay or denial is also applicable,\nincluding lost wages or compensatory damages.\n\nQ4.\n\nCan I sue an insurance company for not paying?\n\nAs long as your plan states applicable coverage and the claim does not violate\nthe terms and conditions of said contractual agreement, yes. There is no\nreason why your policy provider should not pay you, and pay you a reasonable\namount given the damage severity.\n\nFree Consultation\n\n### Contact Us\n\n  * Accidents happen when you least expect them.
