Unfortunately, insurance companies are typically focused on\nprotecting their bottom line rather than treating claimants and their\npolicyholders fairly when they file claims.\n\nAs such, most claimants can benefit from the representation of an experienced\nNew Jersey insurance claims attorney. When you hire an attorney from\nVarcadipane & Pinnisi, PC, they will be a tireless advocate for your\ninterests, as opposed to the insurance company, which will do everything it\ncan to deny or lowball your claim. With legal representation, you are more\nlikely to receive the compensation you deserve for your damages.\n\n### How New Jersey Insurance Claims Attorneys Can Help\n\nOur well-versed New Jersey insurance claims lawyers are prepared and honored\nto represent clients in numerous different types of cases involving\nhomeowner\u2019s insurance and car insurance. This includes those arising from\ndamages from natural disasters like tornadoes and sinkholes or those involving\nuninsured/underinsured motorist coverage claims.\n\nWe will be here to represent you throughout the insurance claims process:\n\n  * Helping you file your claim\n  * Dealing with the insurer on your behalf\n  * Negotiating fair settlement for your compensation \n\nWe also represent injured parties who contact us after struggling\nindependently to obtain compensation from an insurance company. Our New Jersey\ninsurance claims lawyer can help determine the reason why the claimant is\nhaving a hard time and what the next best steps are. Sometimes it\u2019s to file a\nlawsuit for the claim; other times, it\u2019s to file a claim against the insurance\ncompany itself for their unethical behavior.\n\n### What is Bad Faith Insurance in New Jersey?\n\nBad faith is dishonest dealing, sometimes with the intent to defraud. When an\ninsurance company isn\u2019t processing a claim promptly or can\u2019t show good cause\nfor why they aren\u2019t paying someone fairly for their claim, they are likely\nacting in bad faith.\n\nTo prove a claim for bad faith, the policyholder must establish that the\ninsurance company doesn\u2019t have a reasonable basis for not extending benefits\nof the policy and that they know of their reckless disregard or the lack of\nreasonable basis for denying the claim.\n\nWe take cases involving insurance companies that act in bad faith by:\n\n  * Unfairly denying claims and therefore not providing compensation that the claimant deserves\n  * Delaying the processing of the claim or payments\n  * Ignoring your attempts to contact them\u2014not returning phone calls or emails\n  * Making arbitrary demands for evidence of your injuries or for the amount of damages you sustained\n  * Making threatening statements\n  * Misrepresenting the law or policy language\n  * Denying or delaying decisions on claims or requests for approval for medical treatment\n  * Failing to conduct a complete and prompt investigation\n\nIt\u2019s common for insurance companies to attempt to use loopholes in the\ninsurance policy\u2019s language to deny your claim or offer a much lower\nsettlement than what your claim is worth. For example, the insurance company\nmay assert that:\n\n  * Your damages or injuries are expressly excluded from coverage under the policy\n  * Your policy lapsed because you didn\u2019t pay your premium, or there was a delay in the payment of your premium\n  * Your injuries aren\u2019t within the scope of your coverage, as per the insurer\u2019s independent experts\n  * Your damages are less than what you say they are\n\nAn insurance policy is a contract between you and the insurance company. If\nyou fail to abide by the policy terms, such as by failing to pay your premium\nor not making a timely report of an accident, they can cancel your policy.\nHowever, if you are performing under the terms of the contract, they must do\nthe same. If they are refusing to pay for your damages, accusing you of not\npaying a premium that was paid on time, or purports that you are inflating or\nmaking up your damages, they aren\u2019t abiding by the contract. In this scenario,\na New Jersey insurance claims lawyer could help you exercise your legal\nrights.\n\n### New Jersey Insurance Claims Attorney\n\nIf you are attempting to recover compensation from your insurance policy,\ncontact the New York or New Jersey insurance claims lawyers today at\nVarcadipane & Pinnisi, PC, for a free, no-obligation legal consultation.
