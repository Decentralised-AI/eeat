Florin, B.C.S. November 29, 2020\n\n* Over **$1 billion** worth of case results\n\n* Awarded Best Law Firm in 2024 by U.S. News & World report\n\n* 2 Top 50 contested jury verdicts in the U.S. (Over **$90 million** )\n\n* Experienced lawyers with 25,000 cases since 1986\n\nProperty Loss and Damage Claims\n\nAfter experiencing an incident that has caused property damage, residential\nproperty owners may file a claim with their home or rental insurance company\nto secure coverage. If you\u2019re having trouble receiving your claim, or wish to\ndispute a claim, our lawyers can assess the details of your case and determine\nyour legal options.\n\n## Residential Property Insurance Claims Lawyers | Insurance Claims Attorneys\n\nHaving homeowners or rental insurance can be crucial for property owners in\nthe event of an accident or storm that has caused major property damage.\n\nRepairing damage to a home can become costly very quickly\u2014and if you\u2019re\ninsured under a property insurance policy and pay your premiums, you may\nqualify for partial or full property damage coverage. The amount of coverage\nyou have, and the types of damage that qualify for coverage, will depend on\nthe terms and conditions listed within your individual policy.\n\nWhile insurance companies are generally obligated to quickly acknowledge and\nsettle insurance claims under state insurance laws, some property owners may\nhave difficulty securing compensation from their insurance carriers.\n\n**After filing a residential property insurance claim, your claim may be:**\n\n  * denied\n  * underpaid\n  * delayed\n  * mishandled\n\nIf you\u2019ve suffered damage to your residential property and are having trouble\nreceiving payment from your insurer for covered losses, our lawyers can assess\nyour case and determine your eligibility for disputing a claim for wrongful\ndenial or insufficient payment.\n\n## Why People File Residential Property Insurance Claims\n\nHomes, condos, and rental properties can suffer damage through a variety of\ncircumstances. Insurance claims for property damage are often filed in the\naftermath of a costly accident, incident of theft, or major storm.\n\n**Common types of residential property insurance claims include:**\n\n  * hurricane damage\n  * smoke and fire damage\n  * theft\n  * vandalism\n  * water and mold damage\n  * flooding\n  * hail and ice damage\n  * tornado damage\n  * earthquake damage\n\nThe types of coverage you have as a property owner, and the amount of coverage\nyou are entitled to, will depend on the specific policy under which your\nproperty is insured.\n\n## Understanding Residential Property Coverage\n\nSeeking coverage for residential property damage can be a taxing process,\nparticularly for individuals who are filing a claim with their insurer for the\nfirst time.\n\nUnderstanding the types of coverage that are offered under standard\nresidential insurance policies, and the process for filing a claim, cannot be\ntaken for granted as common knowledge.\n\nWhile most homeowners and renters likely have some level of awareness about\ntheir property insurance, not everyone is likely to be an expert on their\ninsurance policy prior to filing a claim for coverage.\n\nThe most basic concept to understand about residential property insurance is\nits purpose\u2014which is to offer property owners financial protection for\nproperty damage that has occurred as a result of an unexpected accident,\nstorm, or other incident.\n\n### Homeowners Insurance\n\nStandard homeowners insurance policies are intended to protect homeowners from\nlosses related to property damage, as well as losses related to accidents or\ninjuries that occur on their properties.\n\n**Types of coverage included in standard homeowners insurance policies:**\n\n  * structural property damage\n  * damage to garages or other external property structures\n  * dwelling coverage\n  * personal belongings\n  * liability protection\n  * additional living expenses (e.g. in the case of emergency relocation)\n\n### Renters\u2019 Insurance\n\nRenters insurance is comparable to homeowners insurance in many ways, as a\nform of insurance that is similarly meant to offer protection for renters\nagainst financial losses related to accident liability and personal property\ndamage.\n\n**Types of coverage included in standard renters insurance policies are as\nfollows:**\n\n  * personal property\n  * liability protection\n  * loss-of-use (i.e. additional protection for covered perils, such as costs related to emergency evacuation)\n\nThe primary difference between homeowners and renters insurance is that the\nformer typically includes dwelling coverage (i.e. structural property damage),\nwhile renters insurance does not.\n\n## Factors That May Affect Your Residential Property Insurance Coverage\n\nThe amount and types of coverage residential property owners have can vary\naccording to several factors, such as: your insurance carrier, your specific\npolicy, and whether you rent or own your home.\n\nIn addition, some states such as Florida have implemented requirements for\nseeking coverage for certain types of property damage. Hurricane damage, for\ninstance, may require paying a higher deductible or the purchase of a separate\npolicy in order to seek coverage, depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s also become common for standard home insurance policies to exclude\ncoverage for damage caused by flooding. Seeking insurance coverage for flood\ndamage may require the additional purchase of flood insurance. Mold damage may\nalso be excluded from standard coverage in certain states.\n\nInsurance laws and regulations for insurance companies are generally\ndetermined on a state-by-state basis. To better understand your residential\nproperty insurance coverage, you may wish to review your specific policy or\nconsult a lawyer, who can assess your policy and explain your coverage to you.\n\n#### Our Featured Case Results\n\nPersonal Injury Property Loss and Damage Claims Construction Negligence Labor\nLaw Product Liability Medical Malpractice Car

Has Been Denied\n\nAfter filing a claim, your insurance company is obligated to get back to you\nwith a claims decision within 14 to 30 days.\n\nThis is meant to protect residential property owners who may be under\nsignificant financial pressure to secure reimbursement for repair,\nreplacement, or relocation-related costs. In light of this, receiving a notice\nthat your claim has been denied can be devastating at worst, and frustrating\nat best.\n\nInsurance laws require insurance companies to follow certain procedures in the\nclaims process to prevent companies from wrongfully denying or underpaying\npolicyholders for covered losses.\n\nHowever, deciding the status of an insurance claim is generally left to the\njudgment of the insurance adjuster handling the claim. The language used to\ndescribe coverage in most policies can often leave room for interpretation,\nwhich may provide an opportunity for the adjuster to verify or deny coverage\nbased on their individual judgment.\n\n**Reasons why an insurance company might deny a residential property claim may\ninclude:**\n\n  * missing or late premium payments\n  * filing for uninsured losses\n  * lacking evidence to prove your property damage\n  * suspicion of fraud\n  * filing for property damage coverage too late\n  * human error on behalf of the adjuster\n  * coverage limits have been met or exceeded\n\nDisputing a denied claim won\u2019t always result in a favorable outcome on your\npart. If your insurer has denied your claim on lawful grounds, an additional\nreview of your claim is unlikely to change their decision.\n\nRegardless, all policyholders are entitled to a review of disputed claims to\nensure there was no error made on behalf of the adjuster.\n\nIf you suspect your insurance company has denied your claim on unlawful\ngrounds, or underpaid your claim, you may be eligible to file a claim against\nyour insurer for operating in bad faith\u2014that is, purposely and unlawfully\nattempting to avoid paying for losses covered under your policy.\n\n## What To Do If You\u2019ve Suffered Property Damage To Your Home\n\nIf your property has sustained damage from a hurricane or accident, there are\nsome steps you can take to increase your chance of receiving payment from your\ninsurance company quickly without unnecessary delay.\n\nAfter any incident that has resulted in property damage, it\u2019s important to\ncollect documentation regarding the nature of the incident, the type of damage\nsustained, and estimated repair and replacement costs, if available.\n\n**To do your part to avoid an insurance claim denial, consider these tips:**\n\n  * take video or photos of the property damage (or accident-related injury)\n  * create an itemized list of personal property items to include in your claim\n  * write down notes about the incident, including time, date, and nature of the incident (e.g. storm, hurricane, tornado, flooding)\n  * gather evidence to prove you own or rent the property\n  * collect statements from any witnesses who can attest to the legitimacy of your property damage and claim\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken steps to provide sufficient evidence to support your claim and\nare still having issues securing payment from your insurer, you may be\neligible to take legal action against your insurer for compensation.\n\n## How A Lawyer Can Help You Dispute An Insurance Claim\n\nInsurance companies are generally required to review and settle insurance\nclaims within 30 to 90 days, depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nIf your insurance company has wrongfully denied, delayed, or underpaid your\nclaim\u2014or is refusing to review your dispute\u2014your next course of action might\nbe to contact an insurance recovery lawyer, who can investigate your claim for\nevidence of bad faith tactics.\n\nHome and rental insurance policies can often contain complex legal language\nthat can be difficult for most people to understand on their own. A lawyer can\nhelp you by deciphering your insurance policy, explaining your coverage, and\nstrengthening your claim for coverage.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already filed an insurance claim with your insurer and need help\nwith the dispute process, one of our insurance recovery lawyers can\ninvestigate your claim and determine your eligibility to take legal action\nagainst your insurer if there is evidence they\u2019ve acted in bad faith.\n\n**What our lawyers can do for you:**\n\n  * provide a free case evaluation to discuss the details of your case\n  * strengthen your insurance claim for a better chance at securing a quick payout\n  * investigate your claim for evidence of bad faith tactics\n  * consult legal and property experts\n  * gather evidence to support your claims dispute\n  * handle communications with your insurance company\n  * work diligently to reach a fair settlement with your insurer as quickly as possible\n  * bring your case to trial if necessary to sue your insurance company\n\nThe insurance recovery lawyers of Florin|Roebig are capable of helping clients\nin all stages of the insurance claims process.

Smith November 29, 2020\n\n* Over **$1 billion** worth of case results\n\n* Awarded Best Law Firm in 2024 by U.S. News & World report\n\n* 2 Top 50 contested jury verdicts in the U.S. (Over **$90 million** )\n\n* Experienced lawyers with 25,000 cases since 1986\n\nProperty Loss and Damage Claims\n\nExperiencing a natural disaster or accident that damages your home or business\ncan be traumatizing. Filing a property damage claim can add unnecessary\nstress. If you\u2019re in a dispute with your insurance company over a property\ndamage claim, you may need a qualified attorney.\n\n## Top-Rated Property Damage Claims Attorney\n\nSuffering a catastrophe that damages your home or business is emotionally\ntaxing. To protect yourself from such an event, you likely carry homeowners or\nproperty insurance coverage. Your insurance is in place to help cover some of\nthe damages caused by the unfortunate event.\n\nFiling an insurance claim for property damage to your business or home can be\na frustrating and drawn-out process. Hiring an experienced attorney from a\nreputable law firm can make it easier for you to manage this process and\ncollect the benefits you\u2019re owed for damages.\n\nDue to the complexities of the process, as well as the possibility of\ninsurance companies either denying coverage or underpaying a claim, it helps\nto understand property loss/damage claims and get some advice on what you can\ndo to recover what you lost.\n\n## Defining Property Loss/Damage Claims\n\nProperty loss or damage claims refer to claims you file with your insurance\ncompany asking for compensation to cover any losses or damages to your\nproperty. These claims differ from personal injury claims in that they only\ncover losses that are considered personal property. If property damage as well\nas personal injury results from an incident, you will have to file separate\nclaims for each issue.\n\nYour homeowners property insurance is likely to cover or insure items or\nproperty that have been damaged or destroyed. In essence, a property damage\nclaim comes down to the cost of repairs, the loss of use, sentimental value,\nand the overall replacement value of the damaged property.\n\nIf your home or business were to experience an accident or natural disaster,\nthen one of the first steps you would take is filing a property damage claim\nwith your insurance company. It\u2019s always a good idea to examine your insurance\npolicy to determine how damages are covered, especially any potential damages\nthat pose a risk to your property.\n\nTo better understand property damage claims, it\u2019s best for policyholders to\ntake a closer look at property damage insurance and learn general information\nabout how it works.\n\n## Understanding Property Damage Insurance\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that over 80 percent of Americans have homeowners insurance.\n\n**Although policies and coverage vary, homeowners insurance plans are likely\nto respond to claims that involve:**\n\n  * damage to the home, roof, or garage, including outbuildings\n  * loss of personal property or belongings as a result of damage or theft\n  * additional living expenses, if the damage makes your home unfit to live in\n\nHomeowners insurance may also cover injuries or property damage to others\nbecause of personal negligence, accidents that happened around the home, and\ndamages to personal belongings or property that are kept in storage.\n\n### General Liability Insurance\n\nIf you\u2019re a business owner or homeowner, you may opt for general liability\ninsurance. This is also known as casualty insurance and protects your business\nand property from third-party claims against you.\n\n**General liability insurance may protect you against claims on your property\nthat include:**\n\n  * slips and falls\n  * negligence\n  * commercial vehicle crashes\n  * watercraft accidents\n  * aircraft accidents\n\nThings that increase your liability risk at home include owning a trampoline,\nswimming pool, or aggressive pets.\n\n## What Kind Of Property Damage Isn\u2019t Covered By Your Insurance?\n\nAlthough homeowners insurance is put in place to cover varying emergencies or\ndisasters, there are some exceptions. For example, earthquake and flood damage\nare not covered in standard home insurance policies.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to purchase a separate policy, or pay for additional coverage, if\nyou live in flood- or earthquake-prone areas. You should also be aware that\ndamage from termites or other pests are sometimes excluded by property\ninsurance policies.\n\n## Types Of Property Damage Covered By Your Insurance\n\nAlthough policies vary, many property and homeowners insurance plans cover\ncertain damages and equipment. Florin|Roebig attorneys have experience in\nhandling a variety of property damage claims and have seen firsthand how\ninsurance companies will undervalue or deny valid claims.\n\nHowever, you may be entitled to a property damage claim if you experience:\n\n### Water Or Freezing Damage\n\nMany home insurance policies cover the damage from a pipe burst or another\nwater-related event. Freezing damage can also occur during the winter months\nin many parts of the United States. Water damage can be detrimental to your\nproperty, so it\u2019s in your best interest to routinely check your pipes to\nprevent any leakage.\n\n### Mold Damage\n\nMold damage can be catastrophic and is a major cause for concern for both\nbusiness owners and homeowners. Mold can be toxic, damage property, and lead\nto serious health risks. Insurance companies may dispute mold damage claims,\nso be aware of potential mold problems in your household or building.\n\n### Wind And Hail Damage\n\nWind and hail damage claims are common. Because these damages result from\nforces of nature, they\u2019re likely covered by your insurance plan. Wind and hail\ndamage is typically covered when it\u2019s caused by a hurricane, hail storm,\ntornado, or other storms.\n\n### Fire And Smoke Damage\n\nFire or smoke damage is not as common as wind and hail damage, but if you\npurchased a comprehensive insurance policy, these damages are likely to be\ncovered. From grease fires in the kitchen to lingering smoke damage to the\nstructure, you\u2019ll want to make sure your policy covers these damages.\n\n### Burglary, Theft, Or Vandalism\n\nOutside of natural disasters or general property damage, you\u2019ll also be\nentitled to a property loss claim if you\u2019ve been the victim of burglary,\ntheft, or vandalism.\n\n**Depending on your policy, property that may be covered includes:**\n\n  * computers\n  * office equipment\n  * tools\n  * furniture\n  * other personal belongings\n\n## How To Prepare For Filing A Property Damage Claim\n\nFiling an insurance claim is much easier if you make a list of your\nbelongings. After a traumatic event like a fire or natural disaster, it can be\nhard to remember all of your possessions. This can also help you settle the\nclaim faster, verify your losses, and help your attorney assess damages or\nlosses if you pursue legal recourse.\n\n**To help you prepare for the worst, here are some tips for how you can create\na home inventory:**\n\n  * keep a list of recent purchases\n  * include basic information, like make or model\n  * count clothing by jeans, shirts, shoes, etc.\n  * write down serial numbers\n  * consider if you need separate coverage for high-end belongings like jewelry\n  * keep track of items in a storage unit\n  * save receipts and other proof of value\n  * take pictures or videos\n  * create digital files\n  * keep adding to your list, but don\u2019t feel overwhelmed\n\n## Why Your Property Loss Or Damage Claim Was Denied\n\nInsurance companies are for-profit businesses. They will likely do everything\nthey can to avoid paying out claims. Some policies are written in ways that\njustify undervaluing your claim, especially when it involves property damage.\n\nCases involving property damage to homes can be especially tricky. For\nexample, your home may have been damaged by hail or a windstorm, but the\ninsurance company may dispute the claim and say the damage was caused by wear\nand tear or failure to maintain.\n\n####

claim with your insurance company,\nbut are struggling with the process, you may want to hire an attorney. This is\nespecially true if your insurance company is disputing your claim.\n\nAn attorney can help you handle the dispute to make sure you receive\nappropriate compensation for the damaged property.\n\n**As you consider your options for legal assistance, take a look at a few of\nthe common disputes leveraged by insurance companies:**\n\n### Coverage Issues\n\nYour insurance company may dispute your claim in regards to coverage. This may\ninvolve disputing the entire claim For example, you may say water damage was\ncaused by a burst pipe, but the insurance company may argue that it was the\nresult of a flood (which wouldn\u2019t be covered unless you have flood insurance).\n\n### Damage Disputes\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for you and your insurance adjuster to disagree on damages.\nAssessing damages of any type is a complicated process, and there may also be\nquestions of whether the property can even be repaired.\n\n### Bad Faith Claims Handling\n\nAlthough insurance companies should be law-abiding, you may find yourself with\nan insurance carrier that\u2019s unscrupulous or negligent in the claims handling\nprocess. Bad faith refers to when your insurance company commits wrongdoing or\nfails to adhere to proper insurance adjusting principles such as dismissing a\nvalid proof of loss when you supply ample information.\n\nThis is known as bad faith because the insurance company rejected your claim\nwhen you were entitled to compensation. Other examples include, refusing to\nhonor the terms of your policy, making an undervalued offer, or denying\ncoverage without a legitimate reason. Many states have strict guidelines to\nprotect consumers from bad faith practices.\n\n## How An Attorney Can Help With Your Property Damage Claim\n\nThere can be a significant amount of money on the line with property damage\nclaims. According to the Insurance Information Institute, the average property\ndamage claim ranges from $10,000 to $12,000. It can help to hire an attorney\nwho will make sure you get the compensation you deserve.\n\nWhile some insurance companies will satisfy their policy agreements with\nhomeowners or business owners, there are several things that can go wrong once\nyou file a claim.\n\nAn attorney can make this process easier, give you peace of mind, and ensure\nyou receive compensation for your loss. Attorneys typically begin with a free\nconsultation to ensure you have a strong case. From there they will work\nthrough the details and documentation of your claim, helping you build your\ncase to have the greatest chance of success.\n\n**If you hire an attorney, they can likely help you with:**\n\n### Moving The Process Along\n\nFiling an insurance claim can be a lengthy process. It\u2019s not unheard of for\nsome insurance companies to routinely delay the process until you\u2019re so\nfrustrated you\u2019ll accept a settlement that\u2019s far lower than the damages you\nsuffered.\n\nAn attorney can help speed up this process by using countermeasures or other\ntactics that can thrust your insurance company into action. A simple threat of\nlitigation is often enough.\n\n### Damage Assessment\n\nEven if you\u2019ve already filed a claim, a comprehensive damage assessment can\nhelp you determine how much your case is worth. If you have yet to file a\nclaim, your attorney can help you understand your legal options for pursuing\nthe maximum amount of damages. Having an attorney at your side can put your\nmind at ease while they determine the specific details.\n\n### Denial Appeals\n\nIf you believe you\u2019ve been denied for an unfair reason, your attorney can step\nin and make sure there wasn\u2019t any wrongdoing in regards to the denial. If\nthere was wrongdoing, your attorney can appeal the denial, or go as far as\nthreatening a lawsuit if your claim was denied in bad faith.\n\n### Settlement Negotiation\n\nPerhaps the most important way an attorney can help you with your case is by\nnegotiating a fair settlement. Since insurance companies need to make money,\nthey may offer low settlements that won\u2019t do much for repairing the damages.\n\nYour attorney, who is likely an expert in negotiations, can deal with the\ninsurance company and use the details of your case to procure a fair\nsettlement.\n\n#### We Are Nationally Awarded Lawyers\n\n## Florin|Roebig Can Help You File A Property Damage Insurance Claim\n\nAt Florin|Roebig, we specialize in civil law and can help you recover\ncompensation for your property damage or loss.
