Florin, B.C.S. November 29, 2020\n\n* Over **$1 billion** worth of case results\n\n* Awarded Best Law Firm in 2024 by U.S. News & World report\n\n* 2 Top 50 contested jury verdicts in the U.S. (Over **$90 million** )\n\n* Experienced lawyers with 25,000 cases since 1986\n\nProperty Loss and Damage Claims\n\nAfter experiencing an incident that has caused property damage, residential\nproperty owners may file a claim with their home or rental insurance company\nto secure coverage. If you\u2019re having trouble receiving your claim, or wish to\ndispute a claim, our lawyers can assess the details of your case and determine\nyour legal options.\n\n## Residential Property Insurance Claims Lawyers | Insurance Claims Attorneys\n\nHaving homeowners or rental insurance can be crucial for property owners in\nthe event of an accident or storm that has caused major property damage.\n\nRepairing damage to a home can become costly very quickly\u2014and if you\u2019re\ninsured under a property insurance policy and pay your premiums, you may\nqualify for partial or full property damage coverage. The amount of coverage\nyou have, and the types of damage that qualify for coverage, will depend on\nthe terms and conditions listed within your individual policy.\n\nWhile insurance companies are generally obligated to quickly acknowledge and\nsettle insurance claims under state insurance laws, some property owners may\nhave difficulty securing compensation from their insurance carriers.\n\n**After filing a residential property insurance claim, your claim may be:**\n\n  * denied\n  * underpaid\n  * delayed\n  * mishandled\n\nIf you\u2019ve suffered damage to your residential property and are having trouble\nreceiving payment from your insurer for covered losses, our lawyers can assess\nyour case and determine your eligibility for disputing a claim for wrongful\ndenial or insufficient payment.\n\n## Why People File Residential Property Insurance Claims\n\nHomes, condos, and rental properties can suffer damage through a variety of\ncircumstances. Insurance claims for property damage are often filed in the\naftermath of a costly accident, incident of theft, or major storm.\n\n**Common types of residential property insurance claims include:**\n\n  * hurricane damage\n  * smoke and fire damage\n  * theft\n  * vandalism\n  * water and mold damage\n  * flooding\n  * hail and ice damage\n  * tornado damage\n  * earthquake damage\n\nThe types of coverage you have as a property owner, and the amount of coverage\nyou are entitled to, will depend on the specific policy under which your\nproperty is insured.\n\n## Understanding Residential Property Coverage\n\nSeeking coverage for residential property damage can be a taxing process,\nparticularly for individuals who are filing a claim with their insurer for the\nfirst time.\n\nUnderstanding the types of coverage that are offered under standard\nresidential insurance policies, and the process for filing a claim, cannot be\ntaken for granted as common knowledge.\n\nWhile most homeowners and renters likely have some level of awareness about\ntheir property insurance, not everyone is likely to be an expert on their\ninsurance policy prior to filing a claim for coverage.\n\nThe most basic concept to understand about residential property insurance is\nits purpose\u2014which is to offer property owners financial protection for\nproperty damage that has occurred as a result of an unexpected accident,\nstorm, or other incident.\n\n### Homeowners Insurance\n\nStandard homeowners insurance policies are intended to protect homeowners from\nlosses related to property damage, as well as losses related to accidents or\ninjuries that occur on their properties.\n\n**Types of coverage included in standard homeowners insurance policies:**\n\n  * structural property damage\n  * damage to garages or other external property structures\n  * dwelling coverage\n  * personal belongings\n  * liability protection\n  * additional living expenses (e.g. in the case of emergency relocation)\n\n### Renters\u2019 Insurance\n\nRenters insurance is comparable to homeowners insurance in many ways, as a\nform of insurance that is similarly meant to offer protection for renters\nagainst financial losses related to accident liability and personal property\ndamage.\n\n**Types of coverage included in standard renters insurance policies are as\nfollows:**\n\n  * personal property\n  * liability protection\n  * loss-of-use (i.e. additional protection for covered perils, such as costs related to emergency evacuation)\n\nThe primary difference between homeowners and renters insurance is that the\nformer typically includes dwelling coverage (i.e. structural property damage),\nwhile renters insurance does not.\n\n## Factors That May Affect Your Residential Property Insurance Coverage\n\nThe amount and types of coverage residential property owners have can vary\naccording to several factors, such as: your insurance carrier, your specific\npolicy, and whether you rent or own your home.\n\nIn addition, some states such as Florida have implemented requirements for\nseeking coverage for certain types of property damage. Hurricane damage, for\ninstance, may require paying a higher deductible or the purchase of a separate\npolicy in order to seek coverage, depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s also become common for standard home insurance policies to exclude\ncoverage for damage caused by flooding. Seeking insurance coverage for flood\ndamage may require the additional purchase of flood insurance. Mold damage may\nalso be excluded from standard coverage in certain states.\n\nInsurance laws and regulations for insurance companies are generally\ndetermined on a state-by-state basis. To better understand your residential\nproperty insurance coverage, you may wish to review your specific policy or\nconsult a lawyer, who can assess your policy and explain your coverage to you.\n\n#### Our Featured Case Results\n\nPersonal Injury Property Loss and Damage Claims Construction Negligence Labor\nLaw Product Liability Medical Malpractice Car

Has Been Denied\n\nAfter filing a claim, your insurance company is obligated to get back to you\nwith a claims decision within 14 to 30 days.\n\nThis is meant to protect residential property owners who may be under\nsignificant financial pressure to secure reimbursement for repair,\nreplacement, or relocation-related costs. In light of this, receiving a notice\nthat your claim has been denied can be devastating at worst, and frustrating\nat best.\n\nInsurance laws require insurance companies to follow certain procedures in the\nclaims process to prevent companies from wrongfully denying or underpaying\npolicyholders for covered losses.\n\nHowever, deciding the status of an insurance claim is generally left to the\njudgment of the insurance adjuster handling the claim. The language used to\ndescribe coverage in most policies can often leave room for interpretation,\nwhich may provide an opportunity for the adjuster to verify or deny coverage\nbased on their individual judgment.\n\n**Reasons why an insurance company might deny a residential property claim may\ninclude:**\n\n  * missing or late premium payments\n  * filing for uninsured losses\n  * lacking evidence to prove your property damage\n  * suspicion of fraud\n  * filing for property damage coverage too late\n  * human error on behalf of the adjuster\n  * coverage limits have been met or exceeded\n\nDisputing a denied claim won\u2019t always result in a favorable outcome on your\npart. If your insurer has denied your claim on lawful grounds, an additional\nreview of your claim is unlikely to change their decision.\n\nRegardless, all policyholders are entitled to a review of disputed claims to\nensure there was no error made on behalf of the adjuster.\n\nIf you suspect your insurance company has denied your claim on unlawful\ngrounds, or underpaid your claim, you may be eligible to file a claim against\nyour insurer for operating in bad faith\u2014that is, purposely and unlawfully\nattempting to avoid paying for losses covered under your policy.\n\n## What To Do If You\u2019ve Suffered Property Damage To Your Home\n\nIf your property has sustained damage from a hurricane or accident, there are\nsome steps you can take to increase your chance of receiving payment from your\ninsurance company quickly without unnecessary delay.\n\nAfter any incident that has resulted in property damage, it\u2019s important to\ncollect documentation regarding the nature of the incident, the type of damage\nsustained, and estimated repair and replacement costs, if available.\n\n**To do your part to avoid an insurance claim denial, consider these tips:**\n\n  * take video or photos of the property damage (or accident-related injury)\n  * create an itemized list of personal property items to include in your claim\n  * write down notes about the incident, including time, date, and nature of the incident (e.g. storm, hurricane, tornado, flooding)\n  * gather evidence to prove you own or rent the property\n  * collect statements from any witnesses who can attest to the legitimacy of your property damage and claim\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken steps to provide sufficient evidence to support your claim and\nare still having issues securing payment from your insurer, you may be\neligible to take legal action against your insurer for compensation.\n\n## How A Lawyer Can Help You Dispute An Insurance Claim\n\nInsurance companies are generally required to review and settle insurance\nclaims within 30 to 90 days, depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nIf your insurance company has wrongfully denied, delayed, or underpaid your\nclaim\u2014or is refusing to review your dispute\u2014your next course of action might\nbe to contact an insurance recovery lawyer, who can investigate your claim for\nevidence of bad faith tactics.\n\nHome and rental insurance policies can often contain complex legal language\nthat can be difficult for most people to understand on their own. A lawyer can\nhelp you by deciphering your insurance policy, explaining your coverage, and\nstrengthening your claim for coverage.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already filed an insurance claim with your insurer and need help\nwith the dispute process, one of our insurance recovery lawyers can\ninvestigate your claim and determine your eligibility to take legal action\nagainst your insurer if there is evidence they\u2019ve acted in bad faith.\n\n**What our lawyers can do for you:**\n\n  * provide a free case evaluation to discuss the details of your case\n  * strengthen your insurance claim for a better chance at securing a quick payout\n  * investigate your claim for evidence of bad faith tactics\n  * consult legal and property experts\n  * gather evidence to support your claims dispute\n  * handle communications with your insurance company\n  * work diligently to reach a fair settlement with your insurer as quickly as possible\n  * bring your case to trial if necessary to sue your insurance company\n\nThe insurance recovery lawyers of Florin|Roebig are capable of helping clients\nin all stages of the insurance claims process.
