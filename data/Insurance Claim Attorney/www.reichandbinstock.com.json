These will vary\ndepending on the type of policy you select and the reasons for which you\nrequire insurance coverage.\n\nTypically, after getting into an accident-suffering property damage or loss at\nno fault of your own, insurance carriers are usually able to file an insurance\nclaim with their provider in order to receive fair compensation. This is based\non the coverage requirements, as well as other stipulations that will be\ndetailed in the individual insurance policy.\n\nFiling an insurance claim for damages due to an environmental catastrophe,\nproperty damage, or another accident for which you\u2019ve been insured is both\nreasonable and common. Without insurance, these accidents can result in a\nsignificant financial burden, on top of mental and sometimes physical\ndistress. However, securing the compensation you\u2019re owed from big insurance\ncompanies isn\u2019t always easy.\n\nSometimes, insurance companies act in bad faith. They undervalue, underpay,\ndeny or even mismanage claims. In high-stress situations, this is the  _last_\nthing clients need or deserve.\n\nSpeaking to an experienced Houston insurance attorney for your insurance claim\ncan give you a better idea of what your options are and avoid the bad faith\ntactics used by insurance providers.\n\n### Insurance Claims\n\nMany different types of insurance claims exist. These are based on the nature\nof the situation and whether claimants are filing on behalf of themselves or\nfor a business.\n\nA common characteristic that crosses all types of big insurance companies is\nhow extremely frustrating is is to deal with adjusters and the other points of\ncontact within the company, regardless if they\u2019re acting in bad faith or not.\n\nWhile most **insurance providers boast of taking care of their policyholders,\nin practice, numerous clients we\u2019ve represented can state otherwise**.\n\n#### Common Types of Insurance Claims\n\nMany types of valid claims you can may with your insurance company. Insurance\npolicies vary widely in nature, and because insurance companies seek to make\nthe most profit possible, they offer an array of insurance options.\n\nThis means that **insurance policyholders should expect a fair dealing when\nopening any of the following claims** :\n\n  * auto insurance claims for car accidents\n  * business interruption claims\n  * VA disability claims\n  * government and municipality claims\n  * fire insurance claims\n  * flood insurance claims\n  * health insurance claims\n  * hurricane insurance claims\n  * life insurance claims\n  * long-term care insurance claims\n  * property insurance claims\n  * homeowners insurance claims\n  * commercial property insurance claims\n  * condominium insurance claims\n  * hotel insurance claims\n  * restaurant insurance claims\n\n### Why Did My Insurance Company Deny My Claim?\n\nYour insurance company may cite a variety of reasons why they\u2019ve denied or\nseemingly undervalued your claim, avoiding the legal obligations to pay you.\nFor clients who are lawfully seeking adequate compensation for damages, this\ncan be a tricky situation to sort through.\n\n **Insurance companies know that it is almost impossible for their clients to\nknow if they\u2019re acting in bad faith or not.** They use this to their advantage\nmore than they\u2019ll ever admit.\n\nWhen policyholders receive an **unexpected denial** or **low payout offer**\nduring the claims process, they often ask questions along the lines of:\n\n  * Is my insurance claim request unreasonable?\n  * Did I overestimate how much my insurance claim should be worth?\n  * Is there any reason why the insurance company may consider me liable for covering my own damages?\n\nOf course, there are reasons why an insurance company may deny a claim that\nwas filed by a policyholder. Depending on the language used in the specific\ninsurance policy and the types of insurance coverage they offer, adjusters may\ninterpret an insurance claim to be ineligible or interpret the insurance\ncoverage in a way that reduces the payout owed to the policyholder.\n\nInsurance bad faith isn\u2019t always at play, but for most insurance companies,\n**you really won\u2019t get fair dealing upfront, unless you work with an insurance\nlawyer** , unfortunately.\n\n#### Common Reasons Insurance Companies Deny or Undervalue Claims\n\n  * The insurance provider determined that the loss wasn\u2019t included in your insurance coverage.\n  * Their adjusters determined your losses were ineligible for coverage or excluded from your insurance policy. \n  * Your damages fall below the insurance policy deductible.\n  * Their adjusters claim the damages are less that what you\u2019re claiming.\n\n### Insurance Claim Mismanagement\n\nSometimes, policyholders find themselves facing a mismanaged claim, or\nunnecessary complication of the claims process. They\u2019re provider acting in bad\nfaith.\n\nInsurance companies are meant to act in good faith and provide fair judgement\nwhen they respond to claims filed by their policyholders. However, insurance\ncompanies seek to make profit. And, **as companies that have a financial stake\nin preserving cash reserves** , sometimes the insurance providers act in bad\nfaith, unfairly denying valid insurance claims. In fact, this deceptive\nbehavior is illegal in the state of Texas.\n\n### Denial And Underpayment Claims\n\nIn the past few years, our Houston office has represented thousands of\nplaintiffs throughout Texas against large insurance companies for acting in\nbad faith, denying and underpaying claims.\n\nReich & Binstock have extensive experience representing those with homeowners\ninsurance, not only in Houston, TX, but throughout the country, with first-\nparty insurance bad faith claims involving Hurricane Ike damage claims that\nhave been mishandled or wrongfully denied.\n\nOur trial attorneys also **devote significant resources to helping business\nowners, apartment property owners and churches** resolve issues in getting the\nmoney they deserve for their hurricane claims and other insurance claims\nsurrounding real property damage .\n\n###  ____ How Can a Houston Insurance Attorney Help?\n\nAs a qualified insurance attorney team with experience handling insurance\nclaim disputes, we can attest to the fact that no single policyholder is\nimmune to the frustration of dealing with an insurance company who is acting\nin bad faith, attempting to either underpay or all-out deny a claim.\n\nKnow that you\u2019re not alone. Individuals, small business owners and even\nrepresentatives for large corporations face issues receiving both fair and\ntimely compensation on a reasonable basis, even if the insurance company isn\u2019t\nnecessarily acting in bad faith.\n\nHaving a large insurance attorney law firm on your side levels with playing\nfield, when it comes to a denied or undervalued insurance claim, especially in\nTexas.\n\n **Insurance companies and their adjusters are a little more willing to do\ntheir job correctly when their client has an insurance lawyer backing them\nup.**\n\n###  ____ What Are Bad Faith Insurance Claims?\n\nVictims count on insurance companies to help them in their harrowing time of\nloss. But, insurance companies are businesses, and businesses must make a\nprofit, which is the American way. But, there is nothing American, nothing\nfair, and nothing moral about an insurance company who acts in bad faith,\npreying on claimants, who already have been victimized, because there is a\nconflict between profit and justice \u2014 and the insurer decided justice would\nlose.\n\nYou see, many policyholders believe that their insurance company almost has a\nattorney client relationship with them. That their needs are a priority to the\ninsurance company, and sadly, this thought process couldn\u2019t be further from\nthe truth.\n\nBad faith insurance is when the insurance company does not treat the client\nfairly by, acting in bad faith, for example:\n\n  * Denying a valid claim\n  * Unreasonably delaying claim payment\n  * Insurance company\u2019s adjuster, looking out for the company\u2019s interest instead of the victim\u2019s entitlement, undervaluing the adjustment\n  * Offering to settle with the claimant for less than the claim is worth\n  * Failing to pay a judgment against the claimant from a lawsuit that the insurance policy requires the insurance company to defend\n\nWhen you must deal with an insurance company, the experienced bad faith\ninsurance claims lawyers at Reich & Binstock in Houston can protect your\nrights to payment of the claims that you deserve during insurance disputes.\nThis will help you avoid any of the insurance provider\u2019s bad faith tactics.\n\nWe specialize in bad faith insurance litigation and can try cases in any\nstate. Insurance claims is a legal specialization of ours, and we\u2019ve been\nrepresenting clients in this area for decades.\n\n###  ____ Does the Attorney Client Relationship Apply for Lawyers Who Handle\nInsurance Disputes?\n\nYes. the attorney client relationship is always a legal obligation between the\ncounsel and the insured party, with the insured party being owed a duty of\nabsolute undivided loyalty by their counsel.\n\nWe aren\u2019t scared of big insurance companies. We\u2019re a nationally recognized law\nfirm who\u2019s stood toe to toe with some of the biggest companies in the world!\n\n## Insurance Lawyer in Houston, TX\n\n **There is no need to be cheated out of a just claim** because of deceptive\ntricks of the insurance trade.
