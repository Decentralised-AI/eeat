However, all too often, the insurance companies seek to profit by\ndealing in bad faith with their customers by unfairly denying, delaying or\nlimiting benefits without a reasonable basis.\n\nIf you feel your insurance company has treated you unfairly and failed to\nfulfill its legal obligations, it is important to consult with an experienced\nbad faith insurance claim lawyer.\n\nAt The Callahan Law Firm, we have extensive experience handling insurance\ndisputes for policyholders in Houston and throughout Texas for claims\ninvolving life insurance, homeowners insurance, and other insurance claims.\n\nIf you believe your insurance claim has been wrongfully delayed or denied,\nplease contact us to arrange a free case evaluation with a Texas insurance bad\nfaith lawyer.\n\n## About Bad Faith Insurance Claims\n\nUnder Texas law, insurance companies owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing\nto their customers. When they fail to honor that commitment and act in bad\nfaith, the people who were relying upon insurance benefits can suffer severe\nfinancial hardship. Examples of insurance bad faith include:\n\n  * Undervaluing claims\n  * Unjustified delay in paying a claim\n  * Refusing to adequately investigate a claim\n  * Creating unreasonable obstacles for the claimant to overcome\n  * Using biased experts such as investigators, loss adjusters and property valuation experts to undervalue a claim\n  * Threatening you, the policyholder, with costly lawsuits or even criminal investigations\n\n## How We Can Help\n\nOur lawyers understand insurance contracts and will review your insurance\npolicy to determine if the terms have been violated. If your valid claim has\nbeen wrongfully delayed or denied, we can help you with your claim for the\ninsurance benefits owed. And in many instances, you may be entitled to make\nadditional claims for emotional distress, attorneys\u2019 fees as well as punitive\ndamages.\n\n  * On This Page\n\n  * Contact Us Now\n\n## Event Contact Form\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nContact Us Now\n\nName*\n\nPhone*\n\nEmail*\n\nTell Us What Happened*\n\nPhone\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\u0394\n\n  * Legally Reviewed By\n\nMichael S.
