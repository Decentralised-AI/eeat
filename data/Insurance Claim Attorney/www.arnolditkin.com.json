Friendly slogans, charming\ncommercials, and slick promises have made it easy to trust our insurers. Yet,\nwhen we need them most, insurance companies often don\u2019t hold up their end of\nthe deal.\n\nWhen someone is struggling to receive a fair settlement, they turn to our team\nat Arnold & Itkin. **We help with insurance claims and cases involving:**\n\n  * Car accidents\n  * Fire damage claims\n  * Business interruption claims\n  * Water and flood damage\n  * Bad faith insurance practices\n  * First-party insurance claims\n  * Hurricane insurance claims\n  * Tornado damage claims\n\nOur insurance claim lawyers have a reputation for taking on cases that make\nheadlines. When a historic storm such as Hurricane Harvey devastates coastal\nAmerica, we\u2019re standing by to make sure people can rebuild their homes and\nbusinesses.\n\nWhen an insurance company refuses to honor a policy after a serious accident,\nwe help people pick up the pieces of their lives. Our track record under the\nspotlight means we\u2019re prepared for any situation that our clients might face.\n\nOur team of insurance claim attorneys has seen every tactic insurance\ncompanies use to unfairly delay or deny valid claims. If your claim has\nstalled, we have experience getting insurers to pay fairly. We\u2019ve stood up to\nthe largest insurers in the nation and have recovered more than $15 billion in\nverdicts and settlements. We fight to level the playing field against large\ninsurance companies, no matter what.\n\n## We Don\u2019t Hesitate to Put in the Work\n\nWhen an insurance company unfairly denies a claim, the process basically\nfollows a script. They\u2019re slow to respond, provide lowball estimates, and send\nclients in endless loops to frustrate them. Hiring our lawyers shows your\ncompany that their tactics won\u2019t be tolerated. Helping people restore their\nlives after an accident or disaster is what we do, and we never settle for\nless than the best for them. When an insurance company says it can\u2019t do more,\nwe step in to tell them they must.\n\nSuccessful insurance claim lawsuits require research, dedication, and\nexperience. We pour the resources into cases that are needed for success. If\nadjusters aren\u2019t being honest, we make sure to change that with our own\ninvestigation and experts. Then, if the other side isn\u2019t being fair after all\nour work, we won\u2019t hesitate to take them to court. For many insurance\ncompanies, hearing \u201cArnold & Itkin\" during a claims process means it\u2019s time to\nplay fair. That\u2019s the power of our dedication to securing results for clients.\n\n## Contact Us Immediately for a Free Consultation\n\nCar accidents, natural disasters, and medical emergencies are all different\nsituations. However, people often find themselves relying on insurance\ncompanies to make them whole after any of them. Our team has experience with\nnearly every type of claim. We\u2019re passionate about helping clients get the\ncompensation they\u2019re entitled to because we know how daunting the process can\nbe. We care about helping clients, we know we can change lives for the better,\nand we never back down from a fight. **No matter what.**\n\nContinue Reading Read Less\n\n  * Record-Setting  **$8 **Billion** **\n\n### Top 3 Largest Jury Verdict in U.S. History\n\n  * Record-Setting  **$860 **Million** **\n\n### History-Making Verdict After Fatal Crane Accident\n\n  * Record-Setting  **$557 **Million** **\n\n### Massive Verdict Won Against Union Pacific\n\n  * Record-Setting  **$357 **Million** **\n\n### Largest Workplace Accident Settlement in Texas History\n\nSee All Our Victories\n\n##  No Matter **How Tough the Fight**\n\nInsurance companies have mastered their tactics. They delay a claim in the\nhopes that a person will be frustrated into settling for less than they\ndeserve. In the worst instances, they deny valid claims because they\u2019re hoping\na claimant won\u2019t contest it. These strategies have created a business model\nthat\u2019s frustrating for claimants but profitable for insurance companies. It\u2019s\nour duty to fight against these unethical strategies for clients, no matter\nhow much the insurance company tries to overwhelm us.\n\nHiring Arnold & Itkin means telling your insurance company that their tactics\nwon\u2019t be tolerated. We investigate claims, hire our own experts, and bring the\nfight to them. We get results by caring about our clients. When we learn about\nwhat our clients have gone through before calling us, the fight becomes\npersonal. Insurance companies are massive, and no one deserves to face their\nbad faith practices on their own.\n\n **Having our firm take your case means it\u2019ll have the care, resources, and\nattention that\u2019s only possible from a law firm that\u2019s recovered billions for\nclients.**\n\n##  Hear Our **Clients' Stories**\n\n  * > \u201cI told him, **\u201cKurt you\u2019re my hero. You\u2019re my knight in shining armor.\u201d** Because that\u2019s how I feel toward him. He\u2019s there to protect me, and I feel so safe. They are driven. They are aggressive.

We're proud of these honors and deeply grateful to\nthe clients who continually put their trust in our team.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \nOur Awards\n\nMedia Mentions\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nFeatured News\n\n##  Common **Questions**\n\n  * ### What If My Insurance Company Is Delaying or Denying My Claim?\n\nIf your insurance is delaying or denying a claim they should be honoring, they\nmight be acting in bad faith. Insurance companies purposefully delay or deny\nvalid claims because they stand to profit more the longer a claim takes.\nAdditionally, insurers hope that making the claims process frustrating will\npush a person to accept less than they\u2019re owed. We're ready to be the advocate\nyou need by leveling the playing field and letting your insurance company know\nthat their tactics won\u2019t work on your claim.\n\n  * ### Do Insurance Companies Have a Time Limit for Responding?\n\nYes, an insurance company has two weeks from the time a claim is made to\nrespond to it. If they take longer than two weeks to respond to a claim,\nthey\u2019re acting in bad faith to the claimant. After responding to a claim,\ninsurers are obligated to provide timely and reasonable updates. If you think\nthat your insurer is taking too long to honor your claim, it\u2019s time to call\nour team. Our insurance claim lawyers can advocate for your recovery and let\nyour insurance company know that their tricks are unacceptable.\n\n  * ### Should I Accept an Initial Offer from an Insurance Company?\n\nAccepting an initial offer might be a mistake. Often, insurance companies try\nto look like they\u2019re doing the right thing by quickly offering compensation.\nTheir hope is to get a person to accept less than they deserve and lose the\nability to obtain additional compensation. Our insurance lawyers can look at\nyour offer, investigate your claim independently, and hold your company to the\ncompensation that you really deserve.\n\n  * ### Should I Negotiate with the Insurance Company on My Own?\n\nIt is generally not advisable to negotiate with the insurance company on your\nown before seeking legal representation. Insurance companies, skilled at\nprotecting their own interests, may attempt to minimize your claim or offer a\nsettlement less than the amount to which you are entitled. By consulting with\nour experienced insurance claim lawyers, we can help you navigate the complex\nprocess, advocate for your rights, and ensure that you receive fair and just\ncompensation for your claim.\n\n##  Types of Claims **We Handle**\n\n  * Bad Faith Insurance Practices \n  * Business Interruption Claims \n  * Fire Damage Claims \n  * First Party Insurance Claims \n  * Hail Damage Claims \n  * Hurricane Harvey Claims \n  * Hurricane Insurance Claims \n  * Insurance Companies \n  * Insurance Lawsuits \n  * Napa & Sonoma County Wildfires \n  * Penalties for Noncompliance \n  * PG&E Wildfire Claims \n  * Property Damage Claims \n  * The Texas Prompt Payment Act \n  * Tornado Damage Claims \n  * Types of Insurance Claims \n  * Underpaid Insurance Claims \n  * Water & Flood Damage Claims \n  * Wind Damage Claims \n  * More Common Questions \n\n## No Matter WhatTM\n\nContact Us\n\n## Get Started with a Free Consultation\n\n  * First Name\n\nPlease enter your first name.\n\n  * Last Name\n\nPlease enter your last name.\n\n  * Email\n\nThis isn't a valid email address.\n\nPlease enter your email address.\n\n  * Phone\n\nThis isn't a valid phone number.\n\nPlease enter your phone number.\n\n  * Yes, I am a potential new client.
