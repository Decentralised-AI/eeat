Some\nexamples of claims we handle include:\n\n  * Property Damage (Homeowners Insurance, Commercial Property Insurance)\n  * Business Interruption Claims\n  * Health Insurance Claims\n  * Life Insurance Claims\n  * Fire Damage Claims\n  * Wind Damage Claims\n  * Water Damage Claims\n  * Flood Damage Claims\n  * Hail Damage Claims\n  * Car Accident Damage Claims\n  * Hurricane & Tornado Damage Claims\n\n## Understanding Bad Faith Insurance Claims in Texas\n\nEvery insurance company must deal with two competing interests. First,\ninsurers must follow the terms of their policies and state insurance laws that\nrequire them to investigate all claims and pay those that are valid. Texas has\nadopted a version of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act that tells\ninsurers what they must do to meet their duties of good faith and fair\ndealing.\n\nAt the same time, insurers do not make a profit by paying claims. They make a\nprofit by collecting premiums and investing the money. When they deny claims,\nthey have more money to invest.\n\nMost of the time, insurers uphold their duties and handle the claims process\nin good faith. But occasionally, they deny claims simply to avoid paying\ninsurance benefits. They may use tactics like unreasonably denying coverage,\nrefusing to negotiate, or delaying their communications with the claimant to\nincrease the pressure on them to settle for an amount well below their losses.\n\nWhen insurers use bad-faith tactics when dealing with claims, they become\nliable to the claimant.\n\n### Bad Faith Insurance Lawsuits\n\nBad faith insurance lawsuits do more than force insurers to pay valid claims.\nWhen an insurance company acts in bad faith, it becomes liable to the\nclaimant. For example, suppose that a tornado hits your house. The insurer is\nliable to you based on the insurance policy and its duties under Texas\ninsurance laws.\n\nWhen an insurer refuses to investigate and pay your valid claim, it becomes\nliable to you for its actions in a bad faith lawsuit. If the lawsuit is\nsuccessful, you will get paid for the losses caused by the tornado and the\nlosses caused by the insurance company. The insurance company exposes itself\nto paying you much more due to its bad-faith tactics.\n\nThe nature of your bad faith claim will depend on your relationship with the\ninsurance company.\n\n#### First-Party Bad Faith Claims\n\nFirst-party claims happen when you are the policyholder and the claimant. For\nexample, suppose that you buy a homeowner's policy and suffer wind damage in a\ntornado. If the insurer refuses to investigate the claim fairly, you have a\nfirst-party claim based on a breach of the insurance policy and bad faith\nhandling of your claim.\n\n#### Third-Party Bad Faith Claims\n\nThird-party claims happen when you are not the policyholder but simply a\nclaimant. This typically happens when the insurer issues a liability claim to\nsomeone who injured you. For example, a malpractice insurance company might\nimproperly handle your claim against a doctor. Texas does not recognize third-\nparty bad faith claims.\n\n## Examples of Bad Faith Tactics\n\nInsurers use many bad-faith tactics during the claims process:\n\n  * Denying a claim without conducting an investigation;\n  * Unreasonably delaying your claim;\n  * Failing to acknowledge or respond to your communications;\n  * Reducing the amount of your claim without a reasonable basis;\n  * Deliberately trying to get you to miss the statute of limitations deadline;\n  * Refusing to negotiate in good faith;\n  * Failing to accept or deny coverage within a reasonable time;\n  * Providing no reasonable explanation for denying a claim;\n  * Misleading you or lying to you;\n  * Using procedural delays, like changing adjusters, to slow down your claim.\n\nRemember, a bad faith insurer wants to frustrate you into dropping your claim\nor accepting a subpar settlement. These are just some of the tactics insurers\ncan use. Other actions that breach your policy or violate the insurer's legal\nduties might rise to the level of bad-faith tactics.\n\nIf you feel you are being treated unfairly, document your interactions with\nthe insurer and talk to a lawyer. Many insurers know to walk up to the bad\nfaith line without crossing it.\n\n### Is Your Company Acting in Bad Faith?\n\nThe bad faith insurance attorneys at Omar Ochoa Law Firm will review your\nclaim to make sure your insurer plays by the rules. Reach out for a free\nconsultation.\n\nFree Case Evaluation\n\n## What Kind of Damages Can You Receive from a Successful Bad Faith Claim in\nTexas?\n\nIf the insurance company improperly denied a valid claim, a court can order\nthe insurer to pay the value of your claim. But the insurer has also damaged\nyou through its actions. Some losses you may have incurred due to the\ninsurance company's bad faith include:\n\n  * Attorney fees for hiring a lawyer to pursue your bad faith claim\n  * Financial losses due to the delays in paying your claim\n  * Emotional distress if the insurer was deliberately trying to frustrate you into accepting an undervalued settlement\n  * Out-of-pocket expenses you paid since you did not receive your insurance benefits\n\nYou may also pursue punitive damages if the insurance company acted so\noutrageously that the court feels the need to punish the insurer's behavior.\nThese damages could be substantial because they are meant to deter the insurer\nfrom engaging in bad-faith tactics in the future.\n\nAn insurance company can act in bad faith even if you end up losing your\nclaim. This is because the insurer's actions could harm you beyond the value\nof the claim.\n\n## How Can Our Bad Faith Claim Attorney Help You?\n\nDealing with bad faith claims requires a two-pronged approach. First, we try\nto get the insurer to pay the claim. We will:\n\n  * Evaluate your policy and claim\n  * Work with experts to appraise your losses\n  * Respond to claim denials with evidence and arguments\n  * Point out the insurer's bad-faith tactics so the insurer knows the risks it faces\n\nSecond, we gather evidence of the insurer's behavior and tactics. Bad faith\nclaims are not easy to prove. The best evidence of the insurer's tactics and\nmotives will be recorded in internal memos and emails. We can pursue this\nevidence during discovery in a lawsuit. In the meantime, we will:\n\n  * Document your communications with the insurer\n  * Create a timeline for your claim\n  * Assess the reasonableness of any settlement offers from the insurer\n  * Investigate whether the insurer has any complaints against it filed with the Texas Department of Insurance\n\nOur goals will be to either get your claim paid fairly or document the\ninsurer's actions in preparation for litigation.\n\n## How Much Do Our Services Cost?\n\nWe charge a contingency fee for handling bad faith insurance claims.

When they fail to deal with third-party claims fairly and\nin good faith, they expose policyholders to liability lawsuits.\n\nThe Stowers doctrine imposes liability on insurers for their handling of\nthird-party claims. A Stowers demand is a settlement offer from the third-\nparty claimant that falls within the policy limits and represents a reasonable\noffer.\n\nIf an insurer rejects a Stowers demand from a third-party claimant and the\nclaimant wins a judgment against the policyholder at trial, the insurer must\npay the entire judgment even if it is more than the demand or the policy\nlimits.\n\nTo take a simple example, suppose that you have an auto insurance policy with\na $30,000 policy limit. You hit a pedestrian, who offers to settle for\n$25,000. Your insurer refuses the settlement, and the pedestrian wins a jury\naward of $40,000. The insurer is on the hook for $40,000 even though you only\nhad $30,000 in insurance because the insurer refused the pedestrian's Stowers\ndemand.\n\n### What Is the statute of limitations for filing a bad faith insurance claim\nin Texas?\n\nTexas sets a statute of limitations for filing a bad faith insurance lawsuit\nof two years from the date of the first bad faith act. It\u2019s difficult to\ndetermine the exact date, so contact our attorney sooner rather than later. If\nyou miss the deadline, your case will be dismissed.\n\n### What Is the process for filing a bad faith insurance claim in Texas?\n\nIf an insurer has unfairly handled your claim, you and your lawyer need to\ngather evidence of the ill-treatment. Proving bad faith is not easy. Your\nlawyer will document all correspondence with the insurer and assess the\nreasonableness of the insurer's actions.\n\nOnce you have documented potentially abusive tactics, you have two ways to\npressure the insurer:\n\n  1. File a complaint with the Texas Department of Insurance, providing evidence to support the complaint.\n  2. File a lawsuit against the insurance company for bad faith and breach of contract.\n\nThe Texas Department of Insurance has limited powers to investigate violations\nof Texas insurance laws and regulations. If it finds a violation, it can\nsanction the insurer.\n\nBut an investigation might not get you what you want. It will take time, and\nat best, the department might order the insurer to take a second look at your\nclaim.\n\nA lawsuit, however, can result in a monetary award and a court order forcing\nthe insurer to pay your claim.\n\n### What Are ERISA Bad Faith Exceptions?\n\nSome types of insurance policies cannot be the subject of a bad faith claim.\nInsurance policies provided by your employer are governed by federal ERISA law\nrather than Texas law. Examples of these insurance policies include employer-\nbased:\n\n  * Health insurance\n  * Disability insurance\n  * Life insurance\n  * Long-term care insurance\n\nSince these policies fall under ERISA, you may have limited rights to pursue a\nbad faith claim against the insurers. Instead, you will need to rely on the\ninsurer's duties outlined in the policy and the implied covenant of good faith\nand fair dealing. You can speak to an experienced insurance lawyer to\ndetermine whether you can use these rights to obtain relief against the\ninsurer.\n\nFeatured Legal Services\n\nIn McAllen\n\n  * McAllen Personal Injury Lawyer\n  * McAllen Property Damage Lawyer\n  * McAllen Insurance Litigation Lawyer\n\nIn Houston\n\n  * Houston Insurance Lawyer\n  * Houston Property Damage Lawyer\n\nIn San Antonio\n\n  * San Antonio Insurance Lawyer\n\nAddresses\n\nMcAllen Office\n\n121 N. 10th Street McAllen, TX 78501(956) 253-3121\n\nHouston Office\n\n440 Louisiana St, Houston, TX 77002(713) 853-9631\n\nSan Antonio Office\n\n4040 Broadway Suite 240, San Antonio, TX 78209(726) 268-1604\n\nResources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Video Center\n\n\u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved.\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Terms and Conditions\n\nWebsite by Grow Law Firm Marketing Agency\u200d\n\nEN\n\n  * ES\n\n",
