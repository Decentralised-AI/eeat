Disputes often arise after an insurance company denies a valid\nclaim, many times without a legitimate reason or explanation.\n\nDisputes also can occur if insurance companies fail to pay medical providers\nthe money they're entitled to from policyholders in states with no-fault\ninsurance and personal injury protection, or PIP. Insurance companies generate\na greater profit when policyholders do not file claims or fail to collect on\nclaims submitted under their policies.\n\nSome insurance companies habitually deny claims\u2014regardless of their\nlegitimacy\u2014and will only investigate a claim if the policyholder takes legal\naction.\n\nScroll down for more\n\n## Find out if you are eligible for a Insurance Dispute lawsuit\n\nTake our FREE quiz to see if you qualify for a lawsuit.\n\nBegin Quiz\n\nHow it works\n\n## It's easy to get started.  \nThe Fee Is Free\u2122.

If you don\u2019t already have this, you can request it from your\nbroker or insurance company. Next, your team will contact your insurance\ncompany to determine the status of your claim.\n\nThese items will help your team understand the basis of your claim and if\nthere is grounds for further investigation and legal action.\n\n    2. ### Investigation\n\nYour attorney and their support staff will dig into the details of your policy\ninvestigate the circumstances surrounding whatever damage or triggering event\nthat caused you to file a claim.\n\nIn this stage, we are gathering the evidence we need to support legal action.\n\n    3. ### Negotiation\n\nYour attorney will file suit against the insurance company. This does not\nguarantee a trial; negotiation with the insurance company is also possible.\n\n  * ## Why Was My Insurance Claim Denied?\n\ndropdown button\n\nUnfortunately, insurance companies often interpret and manipulate the language\nin their policies to minimize or deny valid claims. Insurance providers have a\nsignificant self-interest to protect their cash reserves and to avoid payouts\nto policyholders. When an insurance company denies or undervalues a claim,\nthey may allege that:\n\nThe loss is excluded from the policy.\n\nThe damages are less than what the insured is claiming, or falls below the\npolicy deductible.\n\nThe insurance company\u2019s \u201cindependent experts\u201d or \u201cindependent adjusters\u201d have\ndetermined that no covered loss occurred or is excluded from the policy.\n\n  * ## What Types of Insurance Disputes Does Morgan & Morgan Handle\n\ndropdown button\n\nAt Morgan & Morgan, our attorneys are committed to helping clients settle\ninsurance claims disputes in a wide range of practice areas.

How Much Does Personal Injury Insurance Cost?\n\n# How Much Does Personal Injury Insurance Cost?\n\nIf you are a homeowner or business owner interested in mitigating the\npotential risks of an accident on your property, it's important to do your\nresearch and to select an insurance company that can cover these bases for\nyou. When people have questions about personal injury insurance costs, this\nusually comes down to two main factors. The cost for personal injury\nprotection insurance in those states in which it is offered or required and\npersonal liability insurance, which someone can use to minimize their\npotential exposure in a personal injury case. If you're curious and want to\nknow how much does personal injury cost, read on to learn more.\n\nPersonal injury insurance can help to minimize your exposure to the risk of\nlawsuits, but they should always be evaluated in light of the expenses you pay\nfor personal injury insurance. If you're trying to navigate recovering PIP\nbenefits post-accident or already know that your expenses will exceed what's\navailable to you in PIP coverage, it's imperative to take your case to an\ninjury lawyer.\n\nIf you or a loved one has experienced such an injury, you can complete a free,\nno-risk case evaluation to get more information.\n\n### More Answers to Commonly Asked Questions\n\n## Understanding Personal Injury Protection Coverage\n\nPersonal injury protection is a specific form of insurance that covers damages\nwhen you're hurt in a vehicle accident. Examples include lost wages and\nmedical bills, both of which can add up quickly. For an accident victim,\nmaking sure that insurance pays can be critical for giving you the time and\nfocus to heal and get better after a devastating accident.\n\nIn most states, PIP coverage is optional. However, there are 16 states across\nthe country that have strict PIP minimums. This can be essential for helping\noverlap with your MedPay or health insurance, but multiple policies might even\nbe recommended. Personal injury protection might also be referred to by\ninsurance experts as no-fault insurance. This extends to those instances in\nwhich you are hit as a pedestrian, a cyclist, or as a passenger in another\nperson's car.\n\nThis is different from bodily injury liability insurance. Liability insurance,\nfor example, covers the passenger and driver medical expenses when you're\nfound at fault for causing a car wreck.\n\nBodily PIP coverage, however, pays for your own expenses when you are in an\naccident. There might be overlap with coverage provided by your medpay plan or\nhealth insurance policy.\n\nBut PIP coverage is created and drafted for car-related injuries. Certain\nhealth insurance policies exclude car accident injuries from coverage, meaning\nthat PIP insurance can help to cover the gap and help you when you need it\nmost. While PIP is required in some places, it's optional in others, and those\nwho live in optional states might choose this protection as some additional\npeace of mind within a comprehensive coverage plan.\n\n## Types of Coverage Provided by PIP\n\nWhen you've started your research to determine the personal injury insurance\ncosts, think carefully about what you might have to pay out of pocket if you\ndidn't have PIP protection. The types of expenses will vary from one policy\nand state to another, but can include hospitalization, lost wages, accidental\ndeath benefits, funeral expenses, operations, and certain home care expenses.\n\nIf PIP coverage is required in your state, you have to file a claim under that\npolicy before you can go to your health insurance. PIP insurance also offers\nmany different benefits that you can't get through your health insurance\npolicy. So even if it's not required in your state, it might be your first\nline of defense.\n\nIf you've been injured by another driver and have a car insurance policy that\nincludes PIP coverage, you would usually exhaust all of the coverage under\nyour PIP policy first, before turning to other options. If the medical costs\nassociated with treating your injury are beyond your policy's limits, you\nwould be able to open a claim under the other driver's liability insurance\npolicy.\n\nIf your medical bills exceed a tort threshold by your state, or if you have\nbeen permanently insignificantly injured, there are circumstances in which you\ncan bypass your PIP coverage and file a lawsuit against the other driver. In\nthese complex situations it makes a lot of sense to have the support of an\nexperienced personal injury lawyer. You don't want to be asking the question\n\u201chow much does personal injury insurance cost?\u201d after the fact when you're the\none receiving all the medical bills for an accident you didn't cause.\n\nCar insurance with personal injury protection can cost anywhere from $50 a\nmonth up to a couple of hundred dollars. This will depend on a couple of\ndifferent factors, including the model and make of your vehicle, the total\namount of coverage received, and your age. Proper protection can be provided\nby having a good personal injury protection service, even when you have good\nhealth insurance as well.\n\nOf course, there are multiple insurers you can work with to find the coverage\nand deductibles most appropriate for you. While no one ever wants to have to\nturn to their insurance in the wake of an auto accident, having this\nprotection in place can help you and even your family members during a\nchallenging time in your life.\n\n## Minimum Coverage Requirements for PIP\n\nThe states that require PIP protection each have their own minimum amounts\nthat must be included on the coverage.\n\nThis includes:\n\n  * $3,000 in Utah \n  * $4500 in Kansas\n  * $5,000 in Pennsylvania\n  * $8,000 in Massachusetts \n  * $10,000 in Florida and Hawaii \n  * $15,000 in Oregon, New Jersey, and Delaware \n  * $30,000 in North Dakota \n  * $40,000 in Minnesota \n  * $50,000 in New York\n\n## How Much Does Personal Injury Insurance Cost?\n\nOn average, PIP coverage increases premiums for car insurance coverage by\nabout $4 per year. It's not worth the risk of going uninsured with collision\ncoverage and PIP. Many popular auto insurance policy companies like Allstate\nand USAA offer PIP coverage, so make sure you know your state's minimums or\nsuggested amounts before placing a call to your intended or current insurance\ncarrier.\n\n## How is PIP Different from Personal Liability Insurance?\n\nPersonal liability and personal injury protection are not the same type of\ninsurance.\n\nPersonal liability coverage helps protect you in the event that another party\ngets injured on your property and files a lawsuit against you. It is covered\nin the vast majority of homeowners insurance policies. Personal liability\ninsurance covers the cost of a lawsuit. If you have been sued by someone else\nor for destroying someone's property. Most residential insurance policies will\ninclude this clause, but it can also be purchased as a standalone. There are a\ncouple of different situations in which it might make sense for you to have\npersonal liability coverage, including:\n\n  * Property damage, such as a tree that is located on your property, falling over during a storm and damages your neighbor's roof.\n  * Bodily injury, such as those conditions caused by a dog bite on your property.\n\nHomeowners insurance coverage typically extends to personal injuries as long\nas you have personal liability on the policy. Not every injury, however, will\nbe covered by your personal liability insurance. The only ones that are\ncovered by your insurance company are those caused by negligence on your part.\n\nAlthough it can be overwhelming to find yourself in this situation, the\nsupport of an experienced personal injury lawyer can help you navigate the\nspecifics of a personal injury insurance claim. If you have attempted to\ncontact your personal injury insurance company, and they have refused to\ncommunicate with you or are giving you unreasonable delays or denials in your\ncase, you need to be prepared to share this information with your personal\ninjury attorney.\n\nAn injury attorney can take these circumstances seriously and use this to open\na claim on your behalf or to create a strategy for taking your case to court.\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured and you want to explore your options,\ncomplete a free, no-risk case evaluation to get more information.\n\n## What if my PIP coverage doesn't cover all my injuries?\n\n\n\nAfter a serious accident, you should turn to PIP coverage first to cover your\npayments for necessary treatments. But if you are suffering from a\ncatastrophic injury, it's possible that the extent of your injuries goes well\nbeyond PIP payment. In these situations, your lawyer will help you evaluate\nfiling a claim against the at-fault driver's insurance company or open a civil\nlawsuit.\n\n\n\n## Does Filing a PIP Claim Increase My Insurance Premiums?\n\nPIP is a form of no-fault insurance, meaning that you should not have higher\nrates immediately after an accident because you filed a claim. However,\ninsurance companies do evaluate many factors when deciding the rates to\npresent to you when you're renewing your policy. You might want to evaluate\nother insurance carriers at that time to make sure you can't get a better deal\nif you already have one or two PIP claims on your record.\n\n## Can I Still Get PIP Coverage if I Wasn't Driving?\n\n\n\nPIP insurance is available to a person due to injuries sustained in an auto\naccident. This means that even if you were a passenger inside the car that you\ncan still file a claim for PIP payments. The same is true if you get hurt\nwhile walking or on a bike when struck by a car.\n\n\n\n###  Related Content\n\nSVG\n\n### Product Liability FAQs\n\n  * What Should I Do With the Defective Products in My House?\n  * What Is the CPAP Machine Lawsuit Process?\n  * What Does Product Liability Mean to Me?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Mesothelioma FAQs\n\n  * Who Is at Risk for Mesothelioma?\n  * How Much Does a Mesothelioma Lawyer Cost?\n  * How to Test for Mesothelioma\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Medical Malpractice FAQs\n\n  * How to Hire the Best Medical Malpractice Lawyers\n  * What Should I Do if I Am Misdiagnosed With an Illness?\n  * What is the Average Wrongful Death Settlement?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Fire and Burn Injury FAQs\n\n  * How to Hire the Best Fire Injury Lawyers\n  * How Much Does It Cost for a Fire Injury Lawyer?\n  * How do you keep your home safe from fire?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Insurance Disputes FAQs\n\n  * What Is Bad Faith Insurance?\n  * What Happens if I Reject a Settlement Offer?\n  * How Much Does It Cost to Replace Cast Iron Pipes?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Motor Vehicle Accidents FAQs\n\n  * How to Hire the Best Truck Accident Lawyer\n  * What to Expect During Your Truck Accident Claim\n  * When Should You Hire an Attorney After a Car Accident?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Personal Injury FAQs\n\n  * Why Do I Need a Personal Injury Lawyer?\n  * How to Get More Money From a Car Accident Settlement\n  * Should I Hire a Lawyer for a Minor Car Accident?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Nursing Home Abuse FAQs\n\n  * Who can file a lawsuit against a nursing home?\n  * What is nursing home neglect?\n  * What happens when a nursing home resident complains of neglect or abuse?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Workers' Compensation FAQs\n\n  * What Does a 5 Impairment Rating Mean?\n  * Can I still receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits if I return to work?\n  * I\u2019m scared my employer will retaliate if I file a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Filing A Lawsuit\n\n  * What is mediation?\n  * What is arbitration?\n  * How much is my case worth?\n\nView all questions\n\nSVG\n\n### Overtime and Wages FAQs\n\n  * Why Isn't My Employer Paying Overtime?\n  * What Do I Do if I Witness Workplace Violence?\n  * I\u2019m afraid that if I file an overtime lawsuit my employer will fire me.
