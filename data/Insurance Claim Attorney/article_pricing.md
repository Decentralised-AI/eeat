Based on the information provided, I have analyzed the pricing plans of several insurance claim attorney websites. Here's a comparison review of the available information:

| Company Name             | Hourly Fee | Flat Fee | Contingency Fee | Business Model                                                                                                      |

| www.robertslawfirm.com   | Available  | Available| Available       | N/A                                                                                                                |
| policyadvocate.com       | N/A        | N/A      | N/A             | Contingency fee basis - You only pay your attorney if he or she wins you money. The legal fees will be deducted as a percentage of your final award. |

From the available data, it appears that www.robertslawfirm.com offers various pricing plans including hourly, flat, and contingency fees. On the other hand, policyadvocate.com operates on a contingency fee basis, where clients only pay if the attorney wins the case and the legal fees are deducted as a percentage of the final award.

Unfortunately, there is not enough information available for the other companies to provide a comprehensive comparison.
