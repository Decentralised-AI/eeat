These policies help repair our home when it is damaged by a storm,\nprovide legal costs when our business is sued or help ensure your property is\nprotected if a condo catches fire. The Lone Star State provides homeowners,\nrenters and business owners a range of property insurance options.\n\nListed below are common types of property insurance offered in Texas:\n\n  * Homeowners\n  * Commercial property\n  * Commercial general liability\n  * Builders risks\n  * Condominiums\n  * Loss of use\n  * Debris removal\n  * Business interruption\n  * Apartment\n  * Homeowner association\n  * Boiler and machinery\n  * Law and ordinance\n  * Condo associations\n\n* * *\n\nBack to top\n\n## Damage Covered by Property Insurance\n\nWe never hope to use our property insurance. But when we do, we are thankful\nto have it. What your policy covers depends on the specifics of the policy.\nSome policies, like commercial property insurance, for example, will not cover\nwind and hail damage if you live along the Gulf Coast. If your business is not\nalong the coast, however, it is generally protected from those risks.\n\nMost standard property insurance policies cover the same thing. That being\nsaid, though, you should read through your policy declaration to ensure you\nknow what your policy protects. You would hate to suffer property damage only\nto find out it\u2019s not protected under your policy.\n\nDamages commonly protected by property insurance include:\n\n  * Fire\n  * Hail\n  * Lightning\n  * Windstorms\n  * Explosions\n  * Smoke\n  * Vandalism\n  * Water damage\n  * Damage caused by vehicles and aircrafts\n  * Riots and civil commotion\n  * Theft\n  * Malicious mischief\n\n* * *\n\nBack to top\n\n## Damage Not Covered by Property Insurance\n\nKnowing what your policy does not cover is equally as important as knowing\nwhat is covered. Though a standard policy will not cover certain damages, you\ncan still purchase added protection to ensure you are covered. Keep in mind;\ninsurance coverage varies by policy, so what might be protected by homeowner\u2019s\ninsurance may not be protected under commercial property insurance.\n\nAgain, it cannot be stressed enough how important it is you read your policy\ndeclaration for a better idea of what your policy specifically does and does\nnot cover. Damage caused by the following perils are typically not covered by\nstandard property insurance:\n\n  * Flooding\n  * Mold\n  * Backed up sewage\n  * Sinkholes\n  * Construction\n  * Rodent or insect infestation\n  * Damaged or destroyed high-value items\n  * Continuous water leaks\n  * Wear and tear\n  * Trampoline accidents\n  * Pool accidents\n  * Dog attacks from aggressive breeds\n\n* * *\n\nBack to top\n\n## Common Property Insurance Disputes\n\nWe depend on insurance providers to be there for us after our property suffers\ndamage. More often than not, though, the claims process becomes bogged with\ndisputes that make it harder for us to obtain the settlement we need. Contact\nan insurance attorney if you are having problems with your insurer. An\nattorney can evaluate your situation and advise you on the best way to\nproceed.\n\nListed below are some of the property insurance disputes LeMaster & Ahmed,\nPLLC handles:\n\n  * **Bad faith acts by insurance companies: **Insurance companies are required to handle property claims in good faith. Failing to do so may be considered bad faith and warrants civil action. Bad faith can include denying a claim without an investigation, failing to provide a prompt settlement and misrepresenting policy information.\n\n  * **Disputes over the value of a settlement:** Adjusters are typically known for making deliberately lowball offers right off the bat because they know you need it. You have the right to reject this type of offer, and you should. Speak with an insurance lawyer if your adjuster is unwilling to negotiate a greater settlement.\n\n  * **Policy exclusions:** All policy agreements contain provisions excluding certain damage and types of property. Most property owners are not aware of these provisions until a claim is denied. By having an attorney review your policy when it\u2019s purchased, you can rest assured all the bases will be covered.\n\n  * **Property owner negligence:** An insurance company may deny a claim because they believe the damage was from a negligent property owner. Some provisions may require property owners to take certain steps before their property will be insured. Commercial businesses, for instance, may be required to install security cameras for their property to have theft coverage.\n\nConsult with an insurance lawyer if you are having issues with your insurance\ncompany, even if they are not listed above.\n\n* * *\n\nBack to top\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nCommercial Property Insurance | Texas Department of Insurance \u2013 Visit the\nofficial website of the Texas Department of Insurance for more information\nabout commercial property insurance.
