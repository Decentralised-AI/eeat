When this\nhappens, a Houston bad faith insurance lawyer can handle the bad faith\ninsurance case.\n\nInsurance is supposed to provide protection and security. Unfortunately,\ninsurance companies create obstacles in an attempt to avoid paying claims,\nincluding delaying payments past statutory deadlines, refusing to pay for\ncontractors they previously approved, requiring the insured to resubmit\npaperwork multiple times, and denying claims for frivolous reasons, among\nother bad faith tactics. When this happens, you need a dedicated and dogged\nbad faith lawyer by your side to pursue the fullest compensation available\nunder your insurance policy. Feldman & Feldman has the experience necessary to\npursue claims against insurance companies operating in bad faith.\n\nWhen you make an insurance claim, the law in Texas places a duty of \u201cgood\nfaith and fair dealing\u201d upon the insurance company during claims\ninvestigation. Yet all too often, insurance companies seek to profit by\ndealing in bad faith with their insured by unfairly denying, delaying, or\nunderpaying benefits without a reasonable basis. If your insurance company has\ntreated you unfairly and failed to fulfill its legal obligations, it is\nimportant to consult with an **experienced bad faith attorney**.\n\n## Bad Faith Tactics\n\nInsurance companies often go to extreme lengths to minimize or completely deny\nclaims. Some of the most common bad faith tactics used by insurance companies\nin Texas include:\n\n  * Causing unnecessary delays throughout the claims process\n  * Causing unreasonable delays\n  * Failing to confirm or deny coverage in a reasonable period of time\n  * Hiring biased third parties to handle portions of the claims process\n  * Making threatening statements\n  * Misrepresenting the law\n  * Misrepresenting the terms of an insurance policy by stating some items are not covered when in fact they are\n  * Offering less money than a claim is worth\n  * Performing haphazard investigations of property damage and other insurance claims\n  * Refusing reasonable requests for documentation\n  * Undervaluing claims\n  * Wrongfully claiming damage is due to inadequate maintenance\n  * Wrongfully claiming damage is due to normal wear and tear\n\nIf you experience any one of these bad faith tactics, you need to immediately\ncontact an experienced bad faith lawyer. Insurance companies are first and\nforemost a business, so they are never in a rush to pay out on claims.\nOftentimes, insurance companies take advantage of the fact that most\npolicyholders are completely unaware of their rights. However, all\npolicyholders are legally entitled to a thorough, prompt, and fair\ninvestigation of their claims.\n\nAlthough insurance carriers should honor valid claims, our attorneys know some\ncompanies underpay or simply refuse to pay claims. At Feldman & Feldman, we\nunderstand these denials have devastating financial consequences for claimants\nwhose business or residential properties are in need of urgent repair.\n\n## Bad Faith Damages\n\nWhen you file an insurance damage claim and it turns into a bad faith\ninsurance claim, a bad faith insurance attorney can help you actually obtain\ncompensation at an amount higher than the original face value of your policy.\nIf you have a bad faith insurance claim case, your insurer may be required to\npay damages far beyond what\u2019s listed on your insurance claim. You can actually\nrecover three times your actual damages (known as \u201ctreble damages\u201d) if you can\nprove the insurer \u201cknowingly\u201d violated Chapter 541 of the Texas Insurance\nCode.\n\nFor example, in addition to paying the full cost of damages to your property,\nan insurer may be required to pay for the following:\n\n  * Statutory Penalties\n  * Statutory Interest\n  * Liability for Judgments in Excess of Policy Limits\n  * Attorneys Fees\n  * Emotional Distress\n  * Economic Loss\n  * Punitive Damages\n\nSpecifically in Texas, the following damages are available in a bad faith\nlawsuit:\n\n  * The amount of actual damages\n  * Court costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n  * Any other relief the court deems proper\n\nThere\u2019s one thing in common across all bad faith insurance claims: the more\nreprehensible an insurer acts, the greater the damages possible for the\npolicyholder. The worse your insurance company treats you, the more\ncompensation you can win in bad faith litigation.\n\n## Get Help From a Houston Bad Faith Insurance Lawyer\n\nWhen you or your business have carefully selected insurance coverage to suit\nyour specific circumstances and faithfully paid your premiums, you don\u2019t\nexpect to find a lack of coverage \u2013 especially at a time when you probably\nneed it the most.

This is a shame\nbecause while title insurance is very rarely needed, it can protect homeowners\nfrom huge financial losses.\n\n### **What Is Title Insurance?**\n\nAnytime an individual decides to buy or refinance a house, they will have to\nget title insurance. Title insurance is a type of insurance that protects\nbuyers and lenders from financial loss if ownership of the property or title\nis challenged. Title insurance was created over one hundred years ago when\ndishonest individuals would sell property they didn\u2019t actually own. With the\nrise of the Internet, determining whether or not a seller actually holds the\ntitle to the property is much easier, but unfortunately, not foolproof.\nAlthough every homeowner will purchase title insurance, very few are actually\naware of their rights if they need to submit a claim.\n\n#### **The Rising Cost Of Title Insurance and Bad Faith Claims**\n\nYou would think that because technology has made searching for information\nabout property titles easier that title insurance would become less expensive.\nHowever, prices for title insurance are actually increasing. One of the\nlargest title insurance companies, First American, has actually doubled its\nprices over the past decade. This is easy for title insurance companies to do,\nbecause most states have laws in place preventing other insurance companies\nfrom offering title insurance. This means the title insurance market is small\nand faces little competition. In total, title insurance is an $18 billion\nindustry.\n\nNot only are the costs of title insurance rising, but many policyholders are\nalso discovering the hard way that title insurance companies often use bad\nfaith tactics to avoid paying out on claims. Like any other type of insurance,\na title insurance company\u2019s first objective is to make money, and some\ncompanies take this objective too far by wrongfully denying valid claims.\nUnfortunately, many policyholders are completely unaware of their rights and\naccept the claim denial at face value.\n\n## **Get Help With You Title Insurance Claim**\n\nBuying any type of property is a huge investment, so before you sign on the\ndotted line, it\u2019s important to make sure all related contracts are fair. At\nFeldman & Feldman, we can review title insurance policies to make sure they\nprovide proper coverage. If property has already been purchased, we can help\nwith any title insurance disputes.
