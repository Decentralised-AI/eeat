I was\ncompletely floored\u2013and relieved beyond belief\u2013when Carlos Mahoney called the\nnext day to let me know that he had found a way out of the morass. It was a\nbrilliant solution. Mahoney and his assistant made a truly awful situation\nmuch easier to deal with because of the integrity which they brought to the\nwork. They answered all my questions promptly. They never dropped the ball,\nand were always up to date on the issues when I called, which was no small\nfeat, since the matter had many moving parts and extended over several years.\nThrough it all, Mahoney offered truly wise counsel, making sure that my\nemotions did not get in the way of my interests. He also guided the case\ntoward a conclusion that was far better than I ever hoped or imagined. I\ncannot recommend the firm more highly.\u201d\n\n\\- Laura Edwards\n\n\u201cMr. Mahoney was recommended to me by another attorney for his expertise in\ninsurance coverage. My case had several layers of complexity and Mr. Mahoney\nwas able to navigate through them all in a strategic and succinct manner. His\nstaff is nice and responsive and his fees are reasonable. I would highly\nrecommend his services.\u201c\n\n\\- Matej Polomsky\n\n\u201cCould not be more pleased with my results. Carlos did an outstanding job in\npresenting all the facts in my case. He is held in high regards among his\npeers, and I was able to witness first hand why. Very thorough, with no wasted\ntime. A truly class act. Highly recommend his services.\u201c\n\n\\- Curley Schwatka\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n\n#### Send Us A Message\n\n###### Fill out the form below to contact us today.
