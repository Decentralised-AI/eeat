Although you may be fully insured, it\u2019s a sad fact\nthat many of the popular big-name insurance companies are more interested in\nincreasing shareholder profits than they are in paying out on legitimate\ninsurance claims for loyal policyholders.\n\nFor many of us, the time after an accident or other loss can be stressful and\nunsettling enough. Having to find your insurance company less-than-helpful\nwhen you need them the most will add further unnecessary stress.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve been denied coverage for a so-called \u201cexclusion\u201d or your\ninsurance company isn\u2019t willing to honor coverage that you\u2019ve faithfully paid\nfor, it\u2019s a good idea to speak with a Conroe insurance claim attorney about\nyour case.\n\nThe only way to make sure your insurance company is acting in good faith is to\nhave an insurance claim attorney review your actual policy.\n\n**Contact Scott Law Firm today to begin with a free consultation. We can\nreview your policy and help you seek a fair payout.**\n\n### Auto Policies & Car Accident Claims\n\nCar accidents can leave victims in the hospital and out of work for extended\nperiods of time. Although we like to hope that our insurance adjusters are\nquick to rush in and give us the compensation we deserve, it can take weeks,\nmonths, or longer for some policies to payout.\n\nIn the meantime, hospital bills are piling up, family members are missing\nwork, and there\u2019s no telling how long it will be until you\u2019re back on your\nfeet. If insurance companies act in bad faith by delaying or denying claims,\nit\u2019s a good idea to have a lawyer review your policy and make sure you\u2019re\ngetting treated fairly.\n\n### Homeowners' Claims\n\nMany well-known homeowner\u2019s insurance companies are notorious for denying\ncoverage on righteous claims. Whether you\u2019re recovering from storm damage or\nthe faulty work of a contractor, you should be given the coverage promised in\nyour homeowner's insurance policy.\n\nWrongful denial of benefits from a roof claim or some other type of storm or\nfire damage can seriously delay your ability to safely live in your home and\nget on with your life. A lawyer can review your entire policy and make sure\nthe insurance company is acting in good faith and lives up to all coverage\npromises made in the policy.\n\n### Life Insurance Claims\n\nLosing a loved one, no matter what the circumstances, is a traumatic event for\nfamilies. The one thing you should be able to count on is your life insurance\ncompany coming through on the policy.\n\nWhen insurance companies try to claim an exclusion in coverage after the death\nof a loved one, get in touch with an insurance claim attorney immediately.\n\n### Is Your Insurance Company Going to Take Care of You?\n\nMany Americans think that because they pay their insurance premiums, insurance\ncompanies will be helpful and be there for them when they need them.\nUnfortunately, that isn\u2019t always the case. In fact, many popular big-name\ninsurance companies have documented histories of denying and delaying claims.\n\nInsurance companies often deny and delay claims in an effort to get out of\npaying out policies. Many of these companies are more interested in their\nbottom line than paying out on legitimate claims.\n\nThe American Association for Justice (AAJ) completed a comprehensive and\nexhaustive investigation that included thousands of court documents, SEC and\nFBI records, complaint reports and testimony and depositions from former\ninsurance adjusters from around the nation to find and rate the worst\ninsurance companies in the U.S. This study found that some of the worst were\nAllstate and AIG, among others.\n\n### When to Call an Insurance Claim Attorney in Conroe, Texas\n\nIf you suspect that your insurance company isn\u2019t treating you fairly. Have an\ninsurance claim attorney in Conroe review your case. Holding insurance\ncompanies accountable for the coverage they\u2019ve promised is essential for\nmoving forward and getting on with your life.\n\n**At theScott Law Firm, initial consultations are always free.

To bring a successful claim, you\nwill have to prove that another person or party owed you a duty of care,\nfailed to uphold that duty of care, and therefore caused you injury and\ndamages. For example, drivers have a duty of care to keep others on the road\nsafe by following the law and taking reasonable actions to avoid accidents.\nWhen a driver violates this duty of care\u2014by texting while driving or driving\nwhile drunk, for example\u2014and causes an accident, the injured victims can file\nclaims against the at-fault driver.\n\n  * ###  What are damages? \n\nDamages are any losses you sustain due to the accident. They can be either\neconomic or non-economic in nature, and might include things like medical\nbills, lost income/wages, disability, pain and suffering, and future care\ncosts. The exact damages you may be able to recover will depend on the\nspecifics of your situation. We recommend that you speak to one of our\nattorneys during a free, no-obligation consultation to learn more.\n\n  * ###  How much does a personal injury lawyer cost? \n\nMany people are understandably concerned about the cost of hiring a lawyer.\nAfter all, when you\u2019re already dealing with the financial challenges caused by\nthe accident, the idea of hiring an attorney and paying for legal services can\nseem like an added burden. But when you work with Scott Law Firm, there are no\nupfront or out-of-pocket expenses because we provide our services on a\ncontingency fee basis, meaning we only collect attorneys\u2019 fees if/when we win\nyour case. If we do not recover a settlement or verdict on your behalf, you do\nnot pay.\n\n  * ###  Do I really need an attorney to file a personal injury claim? \n\nWhile you are not required by law to work with an attorney in filing your\nclaim, it is strongly recommended that you do. This is because the insurance\ncompany will likely be working actively against you. Their goal is to do\neverything they can to dispute, devalue, or deny your claim. If you speak\ndirectly to the insurance adjuster, you might accidentally admit fault,\ndownplay your injuries and damages, or otherwise compromise your rights. But\nby having an experienced attorney on your side, you not only have someone who\nwill fight back against tricky insurance company tactics, but you can also\nfocus on what matters most\u2014healing\u2014while your legal team handles the details\nof your case. Most people who work with an attorney during their injury claim\nreceive higher settlements and, in the event the insurance company refuses to\noffer a fair settlement, your attorney will be ready to represent you at\ntrial.\n\n  * ###  Why should I choose Scott Law Firm? \n\nNavigating the legal process is complex and time-consuming. You want a legal\nteam that has the experience and reputation needed to effectively represent\nyou.
