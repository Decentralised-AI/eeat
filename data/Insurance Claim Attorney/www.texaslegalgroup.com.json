Alex has\nput together a great Team!\u201d\n\n\u2013 Derek B.\n\n## An Insurance Company Should Act in Good Faith\n\nWhen you make an insurance claim, insurance law dictates that the insurer\ntreats you with good faith. Originally, your right to fair treatment arose\nfrom common law, which means the right was created through the courts instead\nof statutes. Today, your right to good faith and fair dealings is also\nestablished in the Texas Insurance Code, Chapter 541, Unfair Methods of\nCompetition and Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices, and 542, Processing and\nSettlement of Claims.\n\nUnder the law of good faith and fair dealings, an insurer must:\n\n  * Promptly and properly investigate the claim;\n  * Fairly consider the evidence;\n  * Conduct an honest evaluation of liability for the claimant\u2019s injuries;\n  * Honestly interpret the insurance policy in regard to the claim;\n  * Correspond with the claimant regarding the claim;\n  * Consider the likelihood of the claimant suing and winning;\n  * Consider the possible amount of a verdict in the claimant\u2019s favor;\n  * Make an honest attempt to resolve the claim within a reasonable amount of time;\n  * Approve or deny the claim;\n  * Provide a written explanation of a denial; and\n  * Enter into good faith negotiations regarding an insurance settlement.\n\nIf you filed an insurance claim after an accident, and you believe the insurer\nis acting in bad faith by violating these requirements, contact an insurance\nclaims attorney right away. By hiring an attorney, you will have someone with\nthe knowledge and experience necessary to review your situation. This ensures\nyou receive an objective opinion regarding whether an insurer is acting within\nthe law or in bad faith.\n\nWhen you have a valid insurance claim dispute concerning a bad faith tactic,\nyour attorney can pursue the proper recovery for your original accident, and\nadditional compensation related to the insurer\u2019s illegal conduct.\n\nTexas Insurance companies should be there when we need them.\n\n8 5 - 9 5 %\n\nof U.S. insurers are proven bad faith violators that repeatedly engage in bad\nfaith practices. \u2013 FBIC Report\n\n## Notable Results\n\nOur Texas injury lawyers have the experience, knowledge, and skills that are\nnecessary to ensure your rights remain protected throughout the entire\npersonal injury claims process.\n\nRead More Results\n\n8Million\n\nFatal Vehicle Crash\n\n2.1Million\n\nProduct Defect Claim\n\n## The Stowers Doctrine in Texas\n\nWhen learning about bad faith insurance practices in Texas, you will come\nacross the Stowers Doctrine. This is the name given to the duty of good faith\nand fair dealing the insurance company owes when dealing with a third-party\nclaim against a customer\u2019s policy.\n\nFor example, say there was a car accident, and the other driver claims you are\nat fault. The other driver files a personal injury lawsuit against you, which\nyou notify your insurer of. The Stowers Doctrine refers to their\nresponsibility to you and to handle the process appropriately.\n\nThe Stowers Doctrine requires the insurer to exercise the degree of care and\ndiligence an ordinarily prudent person would in managing their own business\nand negotiating a settlement. The duty is specifically relevant when the other\nparty, the claimant, makes a settlement demand when:\n\n  * The claim against the policy is within the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage;\n  * The demand is within the policy limits; and\n  * The terms of the demand are such that an ordinarily prudent insurer would accept it, considering the insurer\u2019s potential liability if exposed to a court verdict. \n\nIf your insurance company is handling a claim against you, and you believe it\nis not doing so in good faith, call an insurance dispute lawyer at Begum Law\nGroup Injury Lawyers as soon as you can. It is imperative you get the claim on\nthe right track as soon as possible to avoid more serious problems down the\nroad.\n\n## What Is Bad Faith by Insurance Companies?\n\nA bad faith definition is when an insurer fails to uphold its duty to respond\nto your claim with good faith and fair dealings and/or violates a provision of\nTexas\u2019 insurance law.\n\nThe insurer is required by law to treat you a certain way. The insurer, since\nit inherently has an advantage over you, must treat you fairly. If they\nviolate this legal responsibility, then they are said to have acted in bad\nfaith.\n\nTo be clear, denying your claim is not automatically bad faith. There are many\nreasons insurers can rightly deny an insurance claim. However, if your\ninsurance claim is denied improperly, then you may have a legal claim against\nthe insurance company.\n\nWhether or not you are being treated unfairly or in bad faith is difficult to\ntell. You are probably not an expert in insurance law\u2014and you shouldn\u2019t have\nto be. But if your insurance claim process is not going well, or if it has\nbecome obvious that the insurer is not acting as it should call our bad faith\nattorneys at Begum Law Group Injury Lawyers for help.\n\n## Examples of Bad Faith Insurance Practices\n\nAt Begum Law Group Injury Lawyers, our insurance dispute lawyers have worked\nwith all the major insurance companies over the years. We know the ins and\nouts of the insurance process, and tricks adjusters use to deny claims or try\nto limit your compensation. We know how an insurance company should act, and\nwe know what it looks like when they violate the law.\n\nSome examples of when an insurer acts in bad faith include:\n\n  * Delaying the investigation into your claim without reasonable justification.\n  * Failing to conduct a proper and efficient investigation of your claim. \n  * Delaying the processing of your claim without reasonable justification. \n  * Making unreasonable and additional demands for duplicate information or documentation. \n  * Transferring your claim among numerous claims adjusters to delay the process. \n  * Lying about, misrepresenting, or misinterpreting the policy language to avoid liability. \n  * Misinterpreting Texas\u2019 law to avoid liability. \n  * Lying about or misrepresenting other documentation or records to avoid liability. \n  * Altering or canceling the insurance policy after you filed a claim.\n  * Denying your claim without conducting an investigation.\n  * Denying your claim in violation of the policy.\n  * Denying your claim without providing a reasonable explanation in writing.\n  * Accusing you of fraud without a reasonable justification for doing so.\n  * Threatening you or making inappropriate statements toward you. \n  * Failing to decide your claim within a reasonable amount of time. \n  * Failing to maintain reasonable communication with you. \n  * Making an unreasonably low settlement offer and refusing to negotiate.\n  * Harassing or pressuring you into accepting an unreasonably low settlement offer. \n  * Delaying payment after resolving your claim. \n\nThere is a lot an insurance company can do that they shouldn\u2019t. Yet, it can be\nhard to notice it is happening in the midst of your claim. This is why it is\nso important to call an insurance bad faith attorney as soon as something\nfeels wrong. The minute you think you are getting the runaround, or the moment\nan insurance adjuster is rude or inappropriate toward you, you should call us.\n\nYou have the right to be treated fairly during the insurance claim process. If\nyou are not, then you may have a separate bad faith claim against the insurer,\nwhich could entitle you to compensation.\n\n## Your Rights After Insurance Bad Faith\n\nYou have the right to good faith and fair dealings with an insurer. If an\ninsurance company violates that right, then you can file a lawsuit against it.\nYou have the right to pursue compensation based on the insurer\u2019s unlawful\nconduct. In these cases, your potential damages will depend on the insurer\u2019s\nunlawful conduct and your specific financial injury.\n\nYour right to a fair insurance claims process is true whether you file a\nfirst-party claim, which would be against your own insurance policy, or a\nthird-party claim against another person\u2019s policy. Although, your rights and\nlegal options may differ depending on whether you are the insurer\u2019s direct\ncustomer or not.\n\nFor example, if you are part of a first-party claim, then your bad faith\nlawsuit may be based on breach of contract or a breach of the common law.\nHowever, if you are a third-party claimant, you cannot allege breach of\ncontract. You can allege the insurer violated Texas law, though.\n\n## Our Texas Insurance Attorneys Are Here to Help\n\nTwo of the most common issues we see are insurers wrongly denying a claim or\nrefusing to negotiate a settlement appropriately. If an insurer denied the\nclaim when the other party\u2019s liability was obvious, and it should have\napproved it, then talk with our insurance lawyers about suing an insurance\ncompany for denying the claim.\n\nIf the insurer refused to negotiate a settlement, or an adjuster tried to\nharass or bully you into accepting the low settlement, call us to discuss\nfiling a lawsuit against the insurer for a bad faith insurance settlement.\n\nThese issues also can significantly affect you if you are the policyholder. If\nyour insurer wrongly denied or refused to settle a claim against you\nappropriately, and then a court finds in favor of the other party, making you\nliable for a significant amount, call us right away. As your insurance\ncompany, it should have protected you.\n\nIn any of these situations, you are going to need lawyers who sue insurance\ncompanies, not simply attorneys who handle the insurance claim process. Many\npersonal injury and wrongful death lawyers work with insurers on behalf of\ntheir clients. They are well-versed in obtaining compensation. That does not\nmean they are experienced in filing bad faith insurance claims in Texas.\n\n>\n\n## CONTACT BEGUM LAW GROUP INJURY LAWYERS TODAY\n\nWe Know Bad Faith Conduct When We See It\n\nPH:  866.523.4167\n\nOnline Form\n\nAt Begum Law Group Injury Lawyers, we are highly experienced in handling the\ninsurance claim process.
