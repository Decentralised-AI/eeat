You haven\u2019t\nseen anything quite like our vintage horse trailer\n\n mobile bars for events in and around Northeast Ohio. Not enough rooms to fit\nour trailer bars? No problem! We offer bartending services with our wooden\nstationary bar, or just simply our bartending services.\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\n1/1\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\npress to zoom\n\n1/1\n\n#\n\nWe are available for:\n\n  * Weddings\n  * Bridal Showers\n  * Bachelorette/Bachelor parties\n\n  * Birthday Parties\n  * Private Events\n  * Corporate Events\n  * And more!\n\n###\n\nHistory and bio.\n\nI have been bartending at big bars since I was of age and I would love when I\ngot the opportunity to go do special events whether they were golf outings,\nweddings, private parties, or huge corporate events! Traveling around and\nmeeting new people while helping them improve their events has always been a\nthrill so I figured why not make a fun and exciting business out of something\nthat I have always loved!\n\n  \n\nThe events that I have done I would sometimes have to use these tiny bars that\nthey supplied and could hardly move around, so that is when I got the idea of\ncreating my own and bringing it and everything needed to mix and pour with me!\n\n  \n\nThis vintage horse trailer that is being converted into the mobile bar will\ngive me so many opportunities to serve at events in the BEST way possible, not\nto mention it will be so unique and quite the eye catcher when it is finished\nalong with a more stationary bar option that will be hand made as well for\nthose indoor events!\n\n  \n\nI will also have signature drink menus for literally EVERY holiday/occasion if\nthe client wanted to spruce up their event and add a few to their events drink\nmenu! As well as any other drinks of their choices! If I don\u2019t have a menu\nmade for your type of event theme, ask me I will put one together for your\noccasion!\n\n####\n\nMission Statement\n\nWe aim to help you host a memorable and worry-free event full of life and fun.\n\nSee Our Services\n\n  * Home/About\n\n  * Services/Products\n\n  * Contact\n\nThe Little Boozie Bar LLC\n\n**Phone:** +1 330-357-9677 |  **Email:**  ntretiniks@icloud.com\n\nbottom of page\n\n",
