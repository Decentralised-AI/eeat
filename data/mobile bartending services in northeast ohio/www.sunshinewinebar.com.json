Although state law has yet to catch up, mobile bars\nlike Sunshine Wine, which launched just this month, are now available for\nbooking at corporate parties, weddings, and other private events. Should\nSunshine Wine owner Christine Leonard break through the legal barriers, even\nmore opportunities for the new business model could open up within the next\nfew years.\n\nLeonard first conceptualized her business last May, imagining a vintage camper\nsupplying liquor, beer and wine for rural weddings on outdoor farms and in\nbarns. Because liquor licenses are currently unavailable for mobile\nbusinesses, booking Sunshine Wine means customers will purchase their own\nbeverages, and Leonard will bring the supplies and bartenders to fulfill the\nservice. Events also must take place on private property or with the property\nowner\u2019s permission. That all might change, though, as Leonard is currently\nworking to change Ohio law.\n\n\u201cLiquor control, they know, the state knows it\u2019s coming, so we\u2019re just trying\nto get ahead of it and craft it so that it not only meets my needs but also\njust is smart for the state,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make the\npermit make sense so it\u2019s better for everybody.\u201d\n\nAlthough no names were disclosed, Leonard is currently working with someone\nformerly with the Ohio Division of Liquor Control, who\u2019s a liaison between\nLeonard and the legislature. Conversations are just starting to happen, but\nLeonard said everything should come together in another year or so.\n\nCurrently in phase one of her business, Leonard hopes that by the time\nlegislation passes, she\u2019ll have an entire Sunshine Wine fleet, with a second\ncamper and a horse trailer to complete it. She\u2019s been in the hospitality\nbusiness since college, cooking at and managing restaurants, and currently\nselling beer and wine for Natural-State Wine and Craft Beer. And, on her own\ntime, she\u2019s always been the host of all the parties \u2014 it\u2019s all led her to this\nmoment in her career.\n\n\u201cOne thing has just kind of led to the next thing, and this is probably the\nmost exciting and most fun new venture for me,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI enjoy hosting\nparties of my own, too, so I have a lot of party gear. It just kind of made\nsense.\u201d\n\n### Lauren Saga\n\nLauren Sega is a staff reporter for Columbus Underground covering political\nissues on the local, state and national levels, as well as local food and\nrestaurant news. She grew up near Cleveland, graduated from Ohio University's\nScripps School of Journalism, and loves running, traveling and hiking.\n\n\n\n### **Have wine will travel: Rolling, rentable bar hits the road**\n\n614NOW  February 14, 2018\n\nThe theory of Sunshine Wine is about as whimsical as its name. This teeny,\nmobile bar service for hire is your ticket to boozing up your outdoor\nevent\u2014the only hitch is the state doesn\u2019t allow liquor licenses for mobile\nbusinesses.\n\nYet.\n\nRight now, you can rent Sunshine Wine and they\u2019ll provide you with a\nbartender, plastic or glassware, napkins, mixers, and non-alcoholic beverages.\nYou are responsible for supplying the alcohol, that is, until Sunshine Wine\ncan get Ohio law to change. The owner Christine Leonard expects Ohio liquor\nlaws to accommodate rollin\u2019 booze bizzes within a year or so, she told\nColumbus Underground. By that time, Leonard hopes to have a second camper and\na horse trailer to fill out her Sunshine Wine fleet.\n\n> \u201cWe take care of serving your guests out of our camper, clean up and leave\n> without a trace,\u201d reads the website. \u201cLeave the work to us, we know what\n> we\u2019re doing and we love doing it!\u201d\n>\n>  \n\n\n\n###  \n_Please contact me anytime to inquire about reserving our services_\n\n###  _614.204.8359_\n\n###  _or_\n\n###  _christine.sunshinewine@gmail.com_\n\nBack To Top\n\nMobile Bar Sunshine Wine Launches This Month\n\nWelcome\n\nPowered by Squarespace\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n",
