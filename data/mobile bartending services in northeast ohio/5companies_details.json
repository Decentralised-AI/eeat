When he called us the week before to go over details, we had no idea how much alcohol or mixers we would need for the event. He talked us through it and told us exactly how much of each type of liquor and mixers we would need. When it came time for the wedding, he was there early to set up, and our guests were very pleased with his knowledge and professionalism. Thanks for being part of our special day and making there be one less thing for this bride to worry about!"

I connected with Drink Slingers who was offering the exact same service for half the price. They were responsive in their initial communication, contacted me before my wedding to make sure everything was in order and then I didn't have to worry about a thing from there. I even completely forgot to set aside their payment and they were extremely understanding at the end of the night when I had to Venmo them instead. I would highly recommend Drink Slingers for your wedding or any event!"

My only issue was they showed up 10 minutes before the start of my daughter's wedding. We had agreed on 2:30 and I agreed to pay them for 2 extra hours, but they didn't get there until 3:20. That was a little stress that I didn't need at that moment!"

The only complaint I had was that we had a limited amount of alcohol and he made the drinks very strong at first. We became low on liquor fast. I wouldn't have minded but we only had to mixed drinks in terms of bar service so we only bought six bottles of liquor of each. Just something to discuss with the bartender before the wedding starts or have the day of coordinator discuss is all I'm not upset in the slightest I had a great day and I didn't have to worry about it"
