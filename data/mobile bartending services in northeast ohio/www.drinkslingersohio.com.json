He was prompt and brought a mobile bar as my venue didn't\nhave one. He even was willing to stay an extra hour when we didn't want the\nfun to stop! Polite and professional - I will definitely be using their\nservices again in the future!\n\n\u200b\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Kellee C.\n\nWe hired kenny from drink slingers to work our wedding. He was amazing. When\nhe called us the week before to go over details, we had no idea how much\nalcohol or mixers we would need for the event. He talked us through it and\ntold us exactly how much of each type of liqoir and mixers we would need. When\nit came time for the wedding, he was there early to set up, and our guests\nwere very pleased with his knowledge and professionalism. Thanks for being\npart of our special day and making there be one less thing for this bride to\nworry about!\n\n\u200b\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Daralyn B.\n\nOur venue recommended a bartending service that was way out of our budget, so\nI turned to Thumbtack to find someone more affordable. I connected with Drink\nSlingers who was offering the exact same service for half the price. They were\nresponsive in their initial communication, contacted me before my wedding to\nmake sure everything was in order and then I didn't have to worry about a\nthing from there. I even completely forgot to set aside their payment and they\nwere extremely understanding at the end of the night when I had to Venmo them\ninstead. I would highly recommend Drink Slingers for your wedding or any\nevent!\n\n\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Elaine T.\n\nThese guys did a great job overall. I received many compliments about them for\nquick service, good drinks, and very personable. My only issue was they showed\nup 10 minutes before the start of my daughter's wedding. We had agreed on 2:30\nand I agreed to pay them for 2 extra hours, but they didn't get there until\n3:20. That was a little stress that I didn't need at that moment!\n\n\u200b\n\nGig Salad Review\n\n#### Kate L.\n\nKenny was a great bartender. He set up the bar beautifully and monitored\nsupplies all night. He arrived early to make sure that we had a ready-to-go\nbar upon our guests' arrival. He was also super friendly with the little kids\nthere!\n\n\u200b\n\nThumb Tack Review\n\n#### Savannah C.\n\nKenny rocked the show! He bartended our event without a hitch; smooth running\nmachine! Kenny's prices are reasonable and realistic, but his service is\nexceptional! He was very thorough on our several calls, and also helped with\nrecommendations on what alcohols I should buy and the quantity. I could not\nhave chosen a better person and company for my event. Thank you, Kenny, for\nbeing another one of my top-notch vendors!!\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Knot Review\n\n#### Alyssa J.\n\nSuper accommodating. Very friendly and professional. Even let me pay for an\nextra hour that wasn't scheduled. Everyone was having a blast and I didn't\nwant to kick them out. Great value on great service.\n\n\u200b\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Rochelle J.\n\nKenny was hired to service a 50th birthday party on 1/11 - the weather turned\nterrible, he still made it to my event at the time he stated and took care of\nmy guest well. I would suggest anyone who wants a Great Bartender to hire him\n- hands down. He cleaned up behind himself and boxed up the beverages that\nwere left over. I cannot say enough about his services.\n\n\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Samantha B.\n\nKenny and his team are 100% flawless. He was such a help multiple times before\nmy wedding, and was super cool and everyone loved him and his other\nbartenderthat he brought. I would absolutely recommend him to everyone and\nwould hire him again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much Drink Slingers!!\n\n\u200b\n\nThumb Tack Review\n\n#### Kia T.\n\nThe bartender was fantastic in terms of how he interacted with our guests I\nloved him! The company itself was very responsive and professional. The only\ncomplaint I had was that we had a limited amount of alcohol and he made the\ndrinks very strong at first. We became low on liquor fast. I wouldn't have\nminded but we only had to mixed drinks in terms of bar service so we only\nbought six bottles of liquor of each. Just something to discuss with the\nbartender before the wedding starts or have the day of coordinator discuss is\nall I'm not upset in the slightest I had a great day and I didn't have to\nworry about it\n\n\u200b\n\nThumb Tack Review\n\n#### Tony C.\n\nThey were great, made for a food night for everyone. Recommend Drinkslingers\nfor any event. Will use them again in a heartbeat\n\n\u200b\n\nThumbtack Review\n\n#### Marcy T.\n\nWhile I never actually made it up to the bar myself, countless wedding guests\ncame up to me to say how great the bartenders were! They were so efficient\nthat I never once saw a line at the bar in over 6 hours!! They were\npersonable, knowledgeable, and fast.. I couldn\u2019t have made a better choice.\nKenny called the week of to finalize details.. I didn\u2019t have to worry about\ncalling him first. They arrived an hour early to set up and even cut our fruit\nfor garnishes! Don\u2019t choose anyone else.. you won\u2019t regret hiring Kenny and\nhis staff!\n\n\u200b\n\nGigSalad Review\n\n#### Nicole M.\n\nWe could not have been happier with our choice of bartending services for our\nwedding at Happy Days Lodge. Kenny and his staff were super polite and\naccommodating to us and all of our guests. We did run out of liquor halfway\nthrough the reception... however, we gave Kenny extra cash before the wedding\nto grab more if needed (which he did), and everything was fine! Kenny was a\npleasure to work with and made us feel super comfortable throughout the entire\nplanning process!\n\n\n\nThe Knot Review\n\n#### Gretchen M.\n\nWe hired Drink Slingers for our casual wedding Reception. Kenny was extremely\nprofessional- he responded quickly to my emails/texts & helped me plan our\nparty. Matt was our bartender, he arrived on time, set up his work area\nquickly & handled our party effortlessly. I can\u2019t say enough good things about\nDrink Slingers!! Do not hesitate to hire their services for your event!\n\n\u200b\n\nThumb Tack Review\n\n#### Christina H\n\nKenny and Drink Slingers were wonderful to work with! Kenny was available to\nanswer any questions I had, and was very knowledgeable on how much alcohol I\nwould need for my event. They kept the party going, and handled any problems\nthat came their way. We had an emergency venue change 5 days before our\nwedding, and Kenny didn't even blink an eye; he just accommodated to what we\nneeded.\n\n\u200b\n\nThumb Tack Review\n\nContact\n\n\u00a9 2020 by the Drink Slingers Mobile Bartending.\n\nbottom of page\n\n",
