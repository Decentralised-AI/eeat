Best headphones for sleeping for\n2024 How we test the best headphones for sleep Factors to consider when\nchoosing sleep headphones How sound affects sleep  Headphones for sleeping FAQ\n\nA pair of sleep headphones is a great investment for anyone looking to get\nsome sort of tech help for falling asleep. Listening to relaxing sounds or\nsoothing music may help you get deeper rest. According to Michael Breus, sleep\nmedicine expert and the founder of The Sleep Doctor website, \"relaxing music\ntriggers changes to the body that in many ways mimic a sleep state.\" He added\nthat a slower heart rate, slower breathing and lower blood pressure are all\nphysiological changes that make possible the process of falling asleep and\nstaying asleep. Having the best sleep headphones can help you with this.\n\nTo help you find the best headphones for sleeping, we've highlighted several\ndifferent types, including a few headband headphone options, Bluetooth\nheadphones, and earbuds that nestle into your ear canal to block out ambient\nnoise. Keep reading for ways to get a deeper sleep.\n\n## What are the best headphones for sleeping?\n\nOur top choice for sleep headphones are the Pixel Buds Pro, because of their\nversatility. They're great for day and night, block outside noises with active\nnoise canceling and offer great value for the price.\n\n##  Best headphones for sleeping for 2024\n\nDavid Carnoy/CNET\n\n### Google Pixel Buds Pro\n\n####  Best wireless headphones for sleep\n\n$156 at Amazon$179 at Walmart$170 at Best Buy\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Work well for sleep and daytime use * Active noise cancellation and Silent Seal * Comfortable and secure * Long charge time \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Pricey \n\nBattery Life Rated up to 11 hoursNoise Canceling Yes (ANC)Multipoint\nYesHeadphone Type Wireless earbudsWater-Resistant Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof)\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro wireless earbuds fit the bill for people who want a pair of\nquality headphones that are equally as functional during sleep as they are\nduring the day. They have active noise cancellation that helps block\ndistracting noises like snoring while you sleep. Paired with Google's Silent\nSeal technology, the Pixel Buds' ear tips work to enhance noise cancellation\nas they form a gentle seal that keeps quality sound in and environmental\nnoises out.\n\nSleeping with earbuds can be difficult if they fall out too often, but we\nfound that the Pixel Buds Pro comfortably stayed put. Aside from noise\ncanceling, the Pixel Buds Pro have Google Assistant enabled, so with just the\nclick of a button (or voice activation) you can get help on anything from\nanswering a text to directions. They boast up to 31 hours of listening time,\ncrisp sound, wireless charging and more.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:** In-ear \n  *  **Connection type:** Bluetooth\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Active noise canceling\n  *  **Price:** $200\n\nRead our Pixel Buds Pro review.\n\n$156 at Amazon$179 at Walmart$170 at Best Buy\n\nSoundcore by Anker\n\n### Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 Earbuds\n\n####  Best overall earbuds for sleeping\n\n$130 at B&H Photo-Video$130 at Target\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Lightweight and unobtrusive * Great quality for price * Some passive noise cancellation \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Shorter battery life with music \n\nThe Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 earbuds are small and lightweight. Unlike\nother, bulkier options, they fit completely in your ear, so you don't have to\nworry about them shifting or falling out when you roll over at night. Fit is\nparticularly important for side sleepers, who find that other earbuds for\nsleeping brush against their pillow and make a scratching noise.\n\nIn our testing experience, these sleeping earbuds don't actively cancel noise.\nInstead, they passively block out ambient noise, and your selection of sound\noptions does the rest. These sleeping earbuds have the expected wide range of\nsleep noises, from white or brown noise to familiar nature sounds like rain or\nwaves crashing. With the Bluetooth connection, you can also play music (or\nwhatever you want) from your phone while you sleep. Keep in mind that playing\nmusic does drain the battery quicker. You can get a full night of sleep with\nthe preloaded sounds, but music gets you only a couple of hours. For only\n$130, these are some of the most feature-rich and best sleep earbuds you can\nget.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  In-ear \n  *  **Connection type** : Bluetooth\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Passive noise canceling\n  *  **Price:** $130\n\n$130 at B&H Photo-Video$130 at Target\n\nDubs Labs\n\n### Bedphones Sleep Headphones\n\n####  A highly rated wired option\n\n$89 at Dubs Labs\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Wired and wireless options * Fully adjustable * Long battery life \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Memory wire could get in the way \n\nIf you don't like the idea of wearing a headband to bed, the Bedphones Sleep\nHeadphones are another made-for-sleep option that comes without fabric. This\nsleeping headphone option features two ultrathin headphone speakers connected\nby a rubber-coated memory wire that's fully adjustable so you can find your\nperfect earphone fit.\n\nThey come in two versions -- wired and wireless headphone options -- and each\none comes equipped with an in-line microphone and three-button remote that\nallows you to answer phone calls or play, pause or skip whatever you're\nlistening to. A single charge lasts 13 hours, enough for a full night of sleep\nand more.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  On-ear\n  *  **Connection type** : Bluetooth or wired\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Noise masking\n  *  **Price:** $89\n\n$89 at Dubs Labs\n\nQuietOn\n\n### QuietOn 3.1\n\n####  Best noise-canceling earbuds for sleep\n\n$289 at QuietOn\n\n### Like\n\n  * * High-quality noise cancellation * Secure fit * Long battery life \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Expensive * Can't play your own sounds \n\nThe QuietOn 3.1 earbuds use active noise cancellation and passive noise\nreduction to deliver some of the best noise-canceling performance we've\ntested. What looks like wireless headphones in a charging case are small\nearbuds specifically designed to block noise while you sleep. They don't play\nmusic or pair with Bluetooth; they function more like foam earplugs but are\nmuch more effective.\n\nThe earbuds are smaller than any wireless headphones you own and fit snugly\ninside your ear. This prevents them from falling out during the night and\nmakes them comfortable enough for side sleepers to wear to bed. It takes 20\nseconds from the time you remove them from the case to activate the active\nnoise canceling, but once it switches on, the difference in sound is\nsignificant. We ran an extra-loud snoring simulation during the night, and the\nonly sound we could hear while wearing the QuietOn 3.1 buds was our own\nbreathing. The key is to ensure the earbud is snug in your ear, and you may\nneed to change the ear tip for a more sealed fit. The battery life also lasts\nup to 28 hours on a single charge. They're expensive, but if you're\nconsistently losing sleep because of disruptive noises, these may very well be\nworth it.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  In-ear \n  *  **Connection type:** None\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Active noise canceling\n  *  **Price:** $289\n\n$289 at QuietOn\n\nDormi\n\n### Dormi Headband Headphones\n\n####  Best sleep headphones for side sleepers\n\n$50 at Walmart\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Comfortable headband fit&nbsp; * Machine washable \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * May be too warm for hot sleepers * Battery life could be longer \n\nMost sleep headphones aren't designed for side sleeping, but the Dormi\nWireless Sleep Headphones function as a moisture-wicking, lightweight headband\nside sleepers can wear to bed so they can rest comfortably without an earbud\npressing into their head. There are two thin speakers within the headband that\nline up with your ears and deliver surprisingly clear sound quality. The\nheadband pairs with any Bluetooth device, boasts a 10-hour battery life, and\neven has a built-in mic so you can talk on the phone. It's also machine\nwashable; just make sure you take out all the electronics inside before you\nwash it.  \n\nThese headphones are available in two different sizes and multiple colorways.\nThe only downside is for hot sleepers. The material feels like breathable\nathletic wear and should be fine for most people, but folks who are prone to\nsleeping warm might heat up wearing a band around their head all night.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  Over-ear\n  *  **Connection type:** Bluetooth\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Noise masking\n  *  **Price:** $50\n\n$50 at Walmart\n\nAmazon\n\n### Lightimetunnel Sleep Headphones\n\n####  Best sleep headphones that also block light\n\n$23 at Amazon$33 at Walmart\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Blocks both noise and light * No pressure on the eyes * Easy Bluetooth controls \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Battery life could be longer \n\nIf you really want to up your sleep quality, these sleep headphones combined\nwith a sleep mask, from Lightimetunnel (formerly Watotgafer), are a double\nwhammy. Equipped with flat headphones and an ergonomic eye design that doesn't\nput too much pressure on your face, the setup effectively blocks out noise and\nlight all at once. The flat headphones are tucked into a breathable, slow-\nrebound memory foam fabric that's also designed to release tension and stress\nin your face so you can drift off to a more restful sleep.\n\nThe Bluetooth controls are placed in the middle of the eye mask, so you can\neasily control your music or white noise app even when sleeping on your side.\nA single charge lasts at least eight hours, so you should be able to run them\nall night without interruption.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  On-ear\n  *  **Connection type:** Bluetooth\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:  **Noise masking\n  *  **Price:** $20\n\n$23 at Amazon$33 at Walmart\n\nSoundOff\n\n### SoundOff Sleep Noise Masking Device\n\n####  Best calming earplugs for sleeping\n\n$160 at SoundOff\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Long battery life * Soothing pink noise instead of white noise * Comfortable \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Pricey * Can't play own sounds \n\nThe SoundOff Sleep Noise Masking Device is another option that's similar to\nthe QuietOn Sleep Earbuds in function. Like the QuietOn Sleep Earbuds, they\nplay one sound: a pink noise that has an almost wavelike vibe. Pink noise is\nsimilar to white noise but with a smoother sound that hits the same notes as\nsounds you'd find in nature (wind, rain or waves). It's supposed to help you\nfall asleep faster and sleep more soundly and, in our experience, it worked\neffectively. The pink noise playing in the SoundOff device was soothing,\ncalming and effective at blocking out snoring. We were able to get through two\nnights of sleep without needing a recharge.\n\nRather than a slim earbud or squishy foam that you put in your ear, these\nearbuds are shaped like a hearing device, with an earpiece that goes in your\near and a looped plastic piece that wraps around the outside of your ear and\nholds the earplugs in place. They were surprisingly comfortable. The\nadjustable plastic is soft, and it bends and moves with you. (Note that we\nreviewed the earlier, now discontinued version of this product, and we're now\nlinking to the current one.)\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  In-ear \n  *  **Connection type:**  None\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:**  Noise masking\n  *  **Price:** $180\n\n$160 at SoundOff\n\nAmazon\n\n### Maxrock Sleep Earbuds\n\n####  Best budget sleep headphones\n\n$12 at Amazon$21 at Walmart\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Affordable * Lightweight \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Not ideal for side sleeping \n\nThe ultra-lightweight design and squishy silicone ear tips make these\nminimalistic earbuds for sleeping an excellent option for travel. The ear tips\nhave an ergonomic double layer design that fits snugly in most ear canals to\neffectively drown out the noise around you, while the mini speaker in each\nearbud provides quality, balanced sound without too much bass.\n\nBecause they don't have a flat design, they aren't ideal for side sleeping,\nbut if you're a back sleeper or you need something to drown out ambient noise\non a plane or train, these headphones do the trick. Because they're so cheap,\nit won't be a total disaster if they get lost somewhere along the way.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:**  In-ear \n  *  **Connection type:** Wired\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:** Passive noise canceling\n  *  **Price:** $11\n\n$12 at Amazon$21 at Walmart\n\nHoomband\n\n### Hoomband Headband\n\n####  Best sleep headphones with an audio library\n\n$80 at Amazon\n\n### Like\n\n  * * Free app with tons of content * Comfortable * Somewhat cooling \n\n### Don't like\n\n  * * Battery life could be longer \n\nThe Hoomband Headband has two ultrathin, flat speakers that are placed under\nfoam, so you can hear them but can't feel them. The headband itself is made\nfrom a 3D mesh that's soft, thin and helps regulate temperature so you don't\nget too hot while you sleep.\n\nThe Bluetooth headphone setup comes with a free app that includes 100 hours of\naudio content -- including ambient sound options, documentaries, white noise,\nguided meditations, soothing sounds and more -- but it also works like regular\nheadphones that allow you to connect with your favorite apps, like YouTube,\nSpotify and Headspace via Bluetooth.\n\n **Additional details:**\n\n  *  **Headphone type:** On-ear\n  *  **Connection type:** Bluetooth\n  *  **ANC, PNC or other:** Noise masking\n  *  **Price:** $80\n\n$80 at Amazon\n\n## How we test the best headphones for sleep  \n\nWe looked at the following criteria when testing sleep headphones and earbuds\nfor sleeping:\n\n  1.  **Noise** **cancellation** : A snoring simulation was played at high volume near our bedside to test the headphones' ability to block out environmental noises. \n  2.  **Comfort** : Sleeping with too much pressure against the head can cause headaches. Headphones were tested in each sleeping position -- side, back and stomach -- to determine ear tip comfort, stableness of earbuds in the ear and how accommodating they felt from the perspective of different types of sleepers. \n  3.  **Sound** **quality** : We tested headphones for clarity of sound. Crystal clear sound quality isn't required for sleep headphones, but it should be up to par in order to minimize sudden changes in sound that can cause sleep disruption.   \n  4.  **Price** : We included a variety of headphones and earbuds for sleep that fall in different price categories, from wallet-friendly to cream of the crop, so most sleepers can find a good pair regardless of their budget. \n  5.  **Special features** : We considered added features or perks that made headphones even more functional, such as a free audio library, Google assistant and machine-washability. \n\n## Factors to consider when choosing sleep headphones  \n\nSure, any decent set of headphones can play music or meditations, but it's the\ndesign that sets sleep headphones apart. Regular headphones can be bulky and\nuncomfortable to lie on, but sleep headphones are made with a minimal, barely\nthere feel that lets you drift off to sleep while wearing them comfortably\nthroughout the night. For the best sleep headphones, keep an eye out for these\nfeatures:\n\n  * Noise cancellation.\n  * A battery life of eight hours or longer.\n  * Ergonomic, comfortable ear tips. \n  * Flat, thin designs such as headband headphones.\n\n **Read more:** How We Test Products and Services\n\n## How sound affects sleep  \n\nSound has a significant influence on sleep quality, both negative and\npositive. \"There's data that suggests soothing, relaxing music can bring about\nthese effects on you physically,\" Breus said, going on to list:\n\n  * Slower breathing.\n  * A lower heart rate.\n  * Lower blood pressure.\n  * A quieted nervous system.\n  * Reduced muscle tension.\n  * Lowered stress and anxiety.\n  * The release of sleep-friendly hormones, including serotonin and oxytocin, and a reduction in hormones like cortisol.\n\nBreus went on to explain that \"just like soothing sounds can mimic a sleep\nstate, certain sounds signal an alarm for your brain (sirens, loud neighbors,\nweather etc.) so when you hear them, it can cause some level of anxiety.\nAnxiety is really the opposite of sleep.\"\n\nAs a result, sleep headphones act as a good solution for people to listen to\nrelaxing sounds while drowning out the noisy, distracting sounds that evoke\nanxiety and disrupt sleep.\n\n##  Headphones for sleeping FAQ\n\n### Is it OK to wear headphones while sleeping?\n\nYes. There's no harm in wearing headphones while sleeping, as long as your\nearbuds are comfortable enough to keep from disrupting you during the night\nand your volume is not set to a harmful decible. Listening to music or a\nrelaxing podcast before you go to bed can lower your heart rate and also keep\nyour mind from thinking about your daily stressors.\n\n### What type of headphones are most comfortable to sleep in?\n\nSome of the best headphones for sleep include:\n\n  * Pixel Buds Pro\n  * Hoomband Headband\n  * Bedphones Sleep Headphones\n\n### Can sleeping with headphones cause headaches?\n\nIf you're wearing improper headgear while you sleep, it's possible it could\nlead to an external compression headache. That's caused by having too much\npressure around your head and can be avoided if you use earbuds meant for\nsleeping that fit snug in your ear.\n\n### What are the best earbuds to drown out snoring?\n\nThe Quiet.On 3.1 sleep buds are pricey, but they do an impressively good job\nat blocking out sound, including loud snoring. They passed all our tests,\nincluding a snoring simulation and longevity test.\n\nThe information contained in this article is for educational and informational\npurposes only and is not intended as health or medical advice.
