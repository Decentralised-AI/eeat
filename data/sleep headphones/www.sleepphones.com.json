The latest upgrade to their already super\nWireless SleepPhones is amazing. I use these to listen to my podcast before\nsleep and with these I do not bother my wife. They are even so confortable\nthat I sleep with them on my head all night and they even serve as an eye mask\nfor me.  \n  \nTheir support is also outstanding. They did everything to help me, even when I\nhad a crazy demand: Merging my purchases of my old account with a new one I\ncreated by mistake.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Great Product & Service!\n\n**Mike B** on **May 07, 2021**\n\nI ordered the wrong item and when I received it I followed the return/exchange\ninstructions. I will say that my exchange was delivered in less than a week\nfrom the time I mailed it and I received the Bluetooth SleepPhones. I love\nthese! I use them to listen to ASMR to put me to sleep. I'm a side sleeper and\nI have no problem with these they are really comfortable and I often forget\nI'm wearing them. I would definitely buy them again.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Great product.\n\n**Anthony Jazzar** on **May 02, 2021**\n\nHello everyone, I work nights, sleep during the day and these headphones work.\nThrow on some Acoustic Sleep from Itunes or Heart of Space if your old like\nme... the only thing I would say that would make these better is make the band\nwider for better coverage of the eyes.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Winner!!\n\n**Monica** on **Apr 16, 2021**\n\nI am a slide sleeper and the earbuds are extremely painful and after 2 hours,\nthe battery expires. SleepPhones allow me to sleep on my side and ensure a\nfull night sleep.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Great product and A+ customer service\n\n**Olli Ojalainen** on **Apr 12, 2021**\n\nSimply the best solution to listening music etc on bed. Although the speakers\nare small (for a good reason) the sound quality is fine. A lot better from\nwhat I was prepared for.  \n  \n  \nThe customer support has been great!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Decent product\n\n**Mike Margro** on **Apr 01, 2021**\n\ngood product so far but maybe should have opted for the breeze fabric. Fleece\nfabric seems a little stretchy and I can feel the componentry on the back of\nmy head when I'm prone on my back.\n\nDear Mike,  \n  \nThank you for contacting us! We would be happy to exchange your headband for\nthe Breeze fabric. If you could please fill out the warranty form found on our\nsite and send it in with your headband, we will send you a new headband to\ninsert your speakers into! Here is the link to the warranty page:\nhttp://www.sleepphones.com/warranty  \n  \nRegarding the placement of the module, it is normally worn at the back of the\nheadband, but can absolutely be moved to the front or side. Many customers\nwill move the module as that is more comfortable for them.  Some even turn\naround the headband 180\u00ba and place the Velcro\u00ae opening over their forehead. We\nsuggest if moving it to the side, please place it on the opposite side as you\nsleep on.  \n  \nThank you and please let us know if we can be of any further assistance!\n\n\\- SleepPhones\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Best thing since sliced bread!\n\n**Stacey** on **Mar 26, 2021**\n\nI bought these because of eardrum damage and constant ringing in my ears which\nis getting a bit louder these days. I needed something to help me sleep. I\nhave a large head, so I bought the large and it fits nicely...jus right, in\nfact. I hav a 23 3/4\" head. I put these on and the sound is great. I use these\nfor sleeping, not day to day listening, but I am impressed. The sound is\ngreat!  \n  \nI did see reviews stating the ear pieces move around, but I did not find that\nto be the case for me. The head band gets narrower in width as it goes forward\nso they stay put. Some complained that the controls were in the way, but you\ncan easily move it from either side or straight in the middle depending on how\nyou sleep. It has a piece of fabric on the back to keep it in place, which it\ndoes. I therefore did not find this an issue. It charges quickly, and I often\nget two nights of sleep on a single charge. It is easy to unplug and plug into\nthe charger. I turn on my Tesla 369 music and I am off to sleep and stay\nasleep. I cannot thank you enough!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### LOVE these!\n\n**Laura** on **Mar 20, 2021**\n\nI'm a truck driver and I drive team, which means that our truck never really\nstops moving. Either I'm driving or I'm doing my best to sleep in a moving\nsemi truck, which isn't easy. Aside from the movement, there is a lot of sound\nto try to block out, and various light sources.  \n  \nI had tried using standard Apple ear bud headphones - they were uncomfortable\nand I had to mind the cord. I decided to buy the Bluetooth version of\nSleepPhones to see if they would do a better job. Yes, yes they do! The\nspeakers are great quality, and the headband fits nicely around my head and\ncovers my eyes without feeling like I'm blindfolded. Even if my partner is\nsleeping next to me, he doesn't hear my music. The battery lasts all night,\nand is easy to recharge.  \n  \nI've used my SleepPhones while on a trip out of town as well as in the truck.\nThey helped me relax and sleep well in a hotel, an AirBnB, and a friend's\nhouse. These may be more expensive than others on the market, but I'm happy I\nbought these instead of some knock-off that wouldn't have lived up to this\nquality. Highly recommended.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Yah Sleepphones\n\n**Christy L Meyers** on **Mar 16, 2021**\n\nFinally a pair of headphones I can actually sleep in! I couldn't be happier\nwith this product and highly recommend! My quality of sleep has improved more\nthan I ever expected which makes me a healthier, happier person! What are you\nwaiting for...just do it!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Great Product\n\n**Terry Clark** on **Mar 03, 2021**\n\nHi I have been suffering from tinnitus in my ears for 6years and never found\nanything to help with my sleep bought these and best thing ever!! I fall\nasleep all the time with them I\u2019m so comfortable\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Wonderful\n\n**Julia Mosby** on **Mar 01, 2021**\n\nI work midnights and sleep during the day. I bought these to listen to\nrelaxing meditations and also for light reduction. They work wonderfully. Easy\nto use, easy to put on/take off. Comfortable. Highly recommend. I got the gray\npair, I would probably get black for total light reduction next time though.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Love love love\n\n**Jovita** on **Feb 26, 2021**\n\nIt\u2019s so comfortable. Easy to use and perfect for sleep mindfulness or\nlistening to music while walking.  \nBuying more for my adult children.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Love these!\n\n**Shannon** on **Feb 16, 2021**\n\nThe headphones are comfortable and I use them almost every night to help me\nfall asleep. I have had a pair of the original sleep phones for years and\nrecently upgraded to the Bluetooth model. I love the freedom of not having the\nwires to deal with. Also, the customer service is excellent! I made a last\nminute change to my order and it was handled very smoothly.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Almost perfect\n\n**Kel** on **Feb 03, 2021**\n\nI absolutely love my sleep phones and appreciate the upgrades that have been\nmade over the years. The only thing I really hope can be improved is the\ncomfort of the removable rechargeable battery that is placed in the back. When\nI lay it takes a lot of time to find a comfortable position due to feeling the\nbattery in the back. I think a solution could be creating more padding on the\nheadband in the area the headband goes. If others have tips to making this\npart imore comfortable I would love to hear. It\u2019s not a deal breaker as the\nbenefits outweigh this issue but really hoping a model comes out that\naddresses this. Thank you!  \n\nDear Kel,  \n  \nThank you for your review! We do have customers that move the Bluetooth\u00ae\nmodule to the front or side of their heads as this is more comfortable.\n\n\\- SleepPhones\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Can't say enough good things\n\n**Bernice** on **Feb 01, 2021**\n\nI won't ever b without them.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Good Value\n\n**ET** on **Jan 28, 2021**\n\nI listen to hypnotherapy recordings every night and these are far more\ncomfortable than ear buds. The sound quality is decent and it's easy to\ndisassemble to wash the headband. I do find the Breeze poly fabric hot - I\ncan't wear it the whole night.

I anchor it in front with 2 bobby-\npins and that works just fine.\n\nDear Aspen,  \n  \nWe would be happy to exchange the headband for a different size! If you could\nplease fill out the warranty form found on our site and send it in with your\nheadband, we will send you a new headband to insert your speakers into!

For years I have fallen asleep to the TV just for the distraction,\nwhich is a pain for my husband. I wanted to try listening to podcasts but\nwanted earphones that weren't uncomfortable to sleep in so I ordered these.\nAside from getting the band to big based off their size chart, I loved them\nthe first night I used them and had no problems falling asleep without TV for\ndistraction, which my husband now loves. The only issue I have which really\nisn't a deal breaker is once I'm done charging it's sometimes tedious to get\nthe speakers and battery adjusted again. I will probably exchange the band for\na smaller size, but overall I really liked them and as a result my husband\nbought a pair for himself.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Almost the best sleeping partner ever!!\n\n**Tee Murphy** on **Jan 20, 2021**\n\nI ordered my first pair if these in February of 2017. I have used SleepPhones\nin one form or another since then practically every single night. Customer\nservice is awesome and this Christmas I finally got my husband ( who has been\nmaking fun of me for wearing them ) a pair of the wireless ones and guess who\nsleeps with them every night now? I prefer the fleece as it is so cozy and the\nwired ones but may soon make the jump to bluetooth. I love these and have\nseveral pairs. Always keep one in my travel bag!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Finally...sleep\n\n**Vivian Oscher** on **Jan 12, 2021**\n\nI have read other testimonials and they are spot on and eloquently stated.\nIt\u2019s really hard when one has suffered from insomnia most of their life. I\u2019ve\ntried many things including what doctor\u2019s say not to do like watch tv or read\non your devices. The concept of the headband seemed perfect. SCORED! I love\nthem.  \nNow for the REAL reason I\u2019m sending in this review:  \nJenna. Jenna is with Customer Service. For all I know, everyone at Customer\nService is named Jenna. I received an email letting me know that my package\narrived. It hadn\u2019t. Nothing new there. I wanted to let SleepPhones know about\nthe potential loss. I didn\u2019t have to wait days for a response. The response(s)\nfrom Jenna seemed almost immediate, as if she was just hanging by her computer\nwaiting to hear from me. Anyway, she was ready to send out another SleepPhone,\nbut I told her to wait, I had already filed a missing package with USPS. We\ndecided to wait a week, and sure enough, right at the end of the week, my\npackage appeared. I let Jenna know and again, she responded quickly.  \nLater after using the SleepPhones I decided to buy the ones that you don\u2019t\nhave to take apart the whole inside to charge (headbands are very well made).\nNo problem there. Jenna said that I should return the others and they will\nhappily send out the headset that charges via magnets and will later bill me\nthe difference + still give me 10% off. Seriously? This company is all about\ncustomer care.  \nTHANK YOU!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Invest in yourself\n\n**Tony F** on **Jan 06, 2021**\n\nThis product helps you recapture your mind.

Doctor's now changed the cause of\ntinnitus in seniors from crystals on the inner ear to the brain adjusting the\nsound level to hear better but causes the hum or ringing or for some a\nclicking sound. This Sleep phone can have a recorder play beach sounds or any\nsoft relaxing sounds at a level just above the annoying sound. May even\nretrain the brain. To be my Christmas present. Solution for music player with\nshorter battery life to keep up with 12 hour sleep phone battery is to use one\nof the old Android cell phones as a blue tooth player loaded with music or\nrelaxation audio files like beach sounds, Ti-Chi audio sounds or soft music.\nLeave cell phone plugged into charger overnight as it plays.

Not good, but fine. My ears would hurt throughout the night, but I\nthought that was just par for the course. These are SO MUCH BETTER. They do\nnot hurt at all, ever. The earphones are soft and flexible, as is the\nbluetooth receiver. My one problem is that, twice in one night, the main\nbutton on the bluetooth unit was somehow pushed and switched from the ambient\nmusic app I was using to my regular music library (fortunately, nothing loud\nor jarring!). If it happens more, I will definitely reach out to customer\nservice for suggestions, but I think it was just a fluke of placement at this\npoint.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Nice.\n\n**KayT** on **Dec 12, 2020**\n\nInteresting product.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### You can write a review without buying the product\n\n**Dack** on **Dec 06, 2020**\n\nVery cool Kanye!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Sleepezz\n\n**Jo Ann** on **Dec 02, 2020**\n\nLove my new SleepPhone and the new and improved charging system.

The earphones can be a\nlittle uncomfortable when sleeping directly on them (side sleeper) but I can\nusually adjust them so it's barely noticeable. It's the best option out there\nfor anyone who needs music or gentle sounds to sleep but who shares a bed with\na partner. Unplugging and plugging in to charge the Bluetooth every morning is\na little fiddly but I didn't want the Effortless module. I also wash the band\nat least once a week with my laundry to keep it clean.

Each one I\ntried was better then the noise, but then I started to create more noise then\nwhat I was trying to cover up.  \nThen I started to try earplug headphones. They were ALL uncomfortable.  \nI was about to give up, until I found SleepPhones. At first I didn't want to\nspend that much money only to find out it was another waste.  \nFinally I DID spend the money, and I was so happy with the comfort that I told\neveryone about them. As for the SOUND that they produce. I was absolutely\namazed!!!  \nSince I'm probably NOT allowed to mention brand names, I WILL mention prices.\nThese produce sound like headphones that I paid $200 for, and I'm VERY picky,\nbecause I have perfect pitch.  \nNow I sleep soundly without having loud music blasting, and I can also hear\nthings around me. They are also wonderful for sleeping with another person,\nbecause the flat speakers direct the sound in, NOT out.

ASMR sounds delightful on them, and\nbecause you can adjust where the speakers sit on your ears, you can get\namazing tingles from them. I would like the buttons to be easier to at least\nfeel, but understand that would probably make it a bit painful if you end up\nsleeping on your back.  \n  \nThere was a mix up with my order which was entirely my fault - I selected the\nwrong fabric but caught it right away, and also forgot to apply my discount\ncode.

Very satisfied so far.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Excellent for sleep, just one small issue.\n\n**Crazedhatter** on **Dec 11, 2019**\n\nI am very happy with these for being able to listen to Calm or Zees as I fall\nasleep. The only thing I find an issue is that in the morning when I wake up,\nthere is a little pain on the back of my ears from the band being on all\nnight. I suspect that even with the largest size, my head is still slightly\ntoo large, making them a tiny bit tight. I would love to see one more size up\nfor people who have larger than normal heads, or some sort of adjustable size\nto compensate, but the issue isn't big enough to stop me using them. .\n\nHello Crazedhatter,  \n  \nThank you for your review! Please note we also offer RunPhones\u00ae headbands,\nwhich run a bit bigger than our SleepPhones\u00ae headbands.

You would be able to view their sizing chart here -\nhttps://www.runphones.com/sizing  \n  \nWe would be happy to exchange your headband for a RunPhones\u00ae headband!

I listen to the Sleep\nWith Me podcast every night and this makes it almost an ASMR-like experience.\ni just feel cozy and protected when I\u2019m wearing my Sleepphones. But by far the\nbest use of them that I have found is while traveling; they make it easy to\nforget I\u2019m not at home. When I wear them I pull the front down over my eyes so\nthey act as a mask, too. I recently took an overnight train trip and even\nthough I didn\u2019t spring for the sleeper bunk I felt pretty well rested thanks\nto my Sleepphones saving me from the bustle and light and noise of people\nmoving around the train. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without them!\n\n__________\n\n### Work great!\n\n**K.S.** on **Nov 29, 2019**\n\nI got SleepPhones to listen to the Sleep With Me podcast, and I've basically\nbeen using them every night for the past two years. I really do recommend\nthem!  \n  \nI have the sleep timer on my mp3 player set to 60 minutes, and I use that\nonce, sometimes twice a night. At that usage rate, I only have to charge these\ntwo days a week: I usually plug them in on Sunday mornings and Wednesday\nmornings.  \n  \nI wear my SleepPhones along with a Mind Fold. I use a Buff-type head cover\nover the blindfold, then put on the SleepPhones so that the module is over my\neyes. I know this is 180 degrees from how they recommend wearing them, but I\nfind this more comfortable. Try both ways and see what works best for you!  \n  \nOverall, this is really an incredible product, and the best way to listen to\nany sleep podcast as far as I'm concerned!\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Very confortable\n\n**Mark Stein** on **Nov 28, 2019**\n\nThis product is awesome, the speakers aren't big so it very comfortable to lay\nmy head on them.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Amazing quality & function\n\n**Heidi M Slauenwhite** on **Nov 12, 2019**\n\nI have worn my sleepphones every night for over 2 years mow! I love that I can\nlisten to calming music, sleep stories, etc and not disturb my husband! I'm\nable to tune out TV or other noise while in a hotel, and it doesn't disrupt my\nhusband if he stays up later. They are comfy, have great features like volume\ncontrol, pause & play etc. There are various charging options now, and lots of\ndifferent colour bands! When I got mine there was the wires or wireless only,\nand only 2 colour choices! Excellent quality...lasts long too. I finally\nordered new bands last month and an extra Bluetooth module as my first one\nwasn't lasting the 4_6 days on a charge like it was when I first got it. The\nold one still works, I just preferred to have a new one.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### saved my marriage!!!\n\n**char** on **Nov 09, 2019**\n\nI love this product. I am very sensitive to the sound of my husband's snoring,\nespecially when traveling when we cannot always get 2 beds.  \nsometimes I have to wear ear plugs along with my headband, but it is so nice\nto listen to music that helps me relax. I would encourage anyone with sound\nsensitivities to invest in these.\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Jessica\u2019s review\n\n**Jessica** on **Nov 02, 2019**\n\nAmazing \ud83d\ude09\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Sweet Dreams\n\n**Jacquelynn Mariest** on **Oct 29, 2019**\n\nAre used to use my iPhone wired your bolts. I would wake up all tangled in\nthem. The sleep phones wireless headphones are fantastic. I don\u2019t even know\nthat I am wearing them\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Concept is great but design has a major flaw\n\n**Ronald J (Ron) Seden** on **Oct 22, 2019**\n\nI do not understand why the cords have to be so long and do believe they could\nbe shortened by 60% and definitely make proper positioning of speakers inside\nthe head band both easier and better. Otherwise, as this problem is dealt\nwith, which is becoming more frequent these days, I really do really like and\nappreciate mine, MOST OF THE TIME. For what its worth. Best wishes as always.  \nRon\n\nDear Ronald,  \n  \nThank you for your feedback! We offer three different size headbands and all\nour components are interchangeable and can be placed in any headband we offer.\nThat is the reason the cord for the speakers is the length it is.  \n  \nHaving the proper size headband (with a snug fit) is crucial not only for\ncomfort but for sound purposes too. A proper fitting headband will prevent the\nspeakers from sliding around while in use as well as the headband slipping.\nHaving too snug of a headband, however, might cause discomfort as the speakers\nwould be pressing into your ears.  \n  \nShould the headband not be the proper fit, we offer a limited one year\nwarranty on our products and would be more than happy to exchange it for a\ndifferent size! If you could please fill out the warranty form found on our\nsite and send it in with your headband, we will send you a new headband to\ninsert your components into! Here is the link to the warranty page:\nhttp://www.sleepphones.com/warranty  \n  \nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please contact our customer\nsupport team via email (service@acousticsheep.com) or phone (1-877-838-4790,\noption 0, Monday through Friday, 8am - 5pm ET) and we would be more than happy\nto assist you!\n\n\\- SleepPhones\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Fantastic product\n\n**Kishin Mark Eric** on **Sep 29, 2019**\n\nTook the Sleepphone Wireless Bundle very worth it.  \nChoose this because i tend to have movements in the night and wire gets pulled\nand damaged like the previous one i had unfortunately. Received it in a\nbeautiful metallic box.  \nHow i use this::  \nI couple this with silicon earbuds with the stems cutoff to avoid painful\nearbone aches the next day and are big enough not to go deeper. Works great\nhave been using it for a year already and now i am addicted to it for a good\nnight's rest. use small ringing type alarm clock on bed to wake up in case of\nemergency. :D  \nPros:  \n\\- Good for noisy/incosiderate neighbours who bumps walls and floors in\nadjacent units.  \n\\- Those who are unfortunate to work the graveyard shift like myself and have\ntrouble sleeping in the day.  \n\\- Light Sleepers.  \nCons:  \n\\- i work 12 hours and have some travelling to do. Charging is an issue. i\nwish it was quicker. Some days i am unable to charge it fully and get awakened\nin the night without being able to turn it back on. so i get two! :D  \nI earn nothing from writing this review and hope to help my fellow humankind\nwith this wonderful and safe to use invention. I would not buy a cheaper model\nbecause it would be like strapping a bomb to your head while you sleep at\nnight unless you want to experiment to see if it helps you sleep. \\o/\n\nReport as Inappropriate\n\n__________\n\n### Cool product\n\n**Judy Schneider** on **Sep 27, 2019**\n\nHeadphones work perfect!
