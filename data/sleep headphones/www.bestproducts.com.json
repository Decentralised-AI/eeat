The 7 Best Sleep Headphones According to Extensive Testing by a Guy Who Sleeps to White Noise Each Night\n\n# The 7 Best Sleep Headphones According to Extensive Testing by a Guy Who\nSleeps to White Noise Each Night\n\nThese comfy headphones will block out noise, soothe you with calming music, or\nplay your favorite meditation.\n\nBy Brandon CarteUpdated: Jun 28, 2023\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nIf you buy something from the links on this page, we may earn a commission.\nWhy Trust Us?\n\nOne of the worst feelings is being both exhausted _and_ unable to fall asleep.\nWe've all been there, and counting sheep just doesn't cut it. However,\nlistening to music before bed may be a better option, according to the\nNational Sleep Foundation. It has a direct effect on your parasympathetic\nnervous system and has the power to slow your heart rate and breathing, lower\nyour blood pressure, and even trigger your muscles to relax.\n\nDaniel Noyed, a certified sleep science coach and editor at the Sleep\nFoundation said that a good pair of sleep headphones can \"improve sleep\nquality and minimize disruptions during the night.\" Whether you sleep next to\na snorer, have an apartment with thin walls, or hate the sound of traffic\ncoming from outside your window, we've tested a dozen sleep headphones to\nseparate the best from the rest.\n\n## The Best Sleep Headphones\n\n  * **Best Overall:** SleepPhones Wireless Sleep Headphones\n  *  **Best Budget Bluetooth:** Joseche Wireless Sleep Mask Sleep Headphones\n  *  **Best at Blocking Background Noise:** soundcore Sleep A10 Bluetooth Earbuds\n  *  **Best Earbuds-Style:**Kokoon Nightbuds Sleep Headphones\n  *  **Most Comfortable Headband:** Perytong Sleep Headphones Wireless\n  *  **Best Wired Pair:** CozyPhones Contour Series Sleep Headphones\n  *  **Best Audio Library:** HoomBand Sleep Headphones\n\n##  **What to Consider**\n\nBefore picking your first pair of sleep headphones to gift or use yourself,\nthere are several important factors to consider.\n\n### Comfort\n\nYes, comfort is subjective but if your sleep headphones are uncomfortable,\nchances are you won't wear them. We made sure to include multiple styles of\nsleep headphones ranging from wireless earbuds to headbands that come in\ndifferent sizes to cater to various head sizes and shapes.\n\n### Sleep Style\n\nPay attention to whether or not the headphones are wireless or have a cord. We\nstrongly recommend wireless headsets for people who tend to toss and turn,\nsince wired pairs can get tangled or become dislodged from your ear.\n\n### Battery Life\n\nMake sure that the sleep headphones you select deliver a battery life of 8\nhours or longer.\n\n## How We Chose\n\nI've been testing sleep headphones for 4 years now. Before calling in 12 total\npairs for testing, I compared 40 pairs of sleep headphones to find models that\nare easy to use, offer a comfortable but breathable fit, and deliver enough\nbattery life to make it through 8 hours of sleep. To help narrow down which\nmodels I tested, I read several customer reviews on Amazon and ones directly\nfrom manufacturers' websites and scoured editorial reviews from sites like\nCNET, Wirecutter, and Sound Guys.\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nAfter carefully vetting our picks \u2014 which include both wired and wireless\nheadphones \u2014 I spent a week testing them both in and out of bed. During the\ntesting process, I determined the following:\n\n  * Do the headphones have convenient controls?\n  * Do they deliver decent audio quality?\n  * Are they comfortable to wear?\n  * Do they hold up over time?\n  * Are they washable?\n  * Do they block external noise?\n  * Do they stay on overnight?\n\nI also made note of their battery life and tested them to see how easy they\nwere to pair to my Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.\n\nWhether you want to cue up some classical music, an audiobook, rain sounds, or\nASMR videos on YouTube for a better night's rest, here are the 13 best sleep\nheadphones that provide comfort and sound clarity. Hopefully, they can help\nyou or a loved one finally get that much-needed sleep you deserve.\n\n1\n\nBest Overall\n\n## SleepPhones Wireless Sleep Headphones\n\n1\n\nBest Overall\n\n## SleepPhones Wireless Sleep Headphones\n\n$100 at Amazon\n\nCredit: Trevor Raab\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Comes in multiple sizes to fit all headshapes\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Audio quality is decent, but not great\n\nThe AcousticSheep SleepPhones are a wireless pair of sleep headphones nestled\nin a super soft headband. I spent several nights wearing them to bed and fell\nin love with them for their easy setup, onboard controls, good fit, and lack\nof wires. Plus, they're the most comfortable sleep headphones you can buy\ntoday.  \n\nThey come in three sizes, two fabric options, and five different colors. After\nmeasuring my noggin, I settled on a medium \"breeze\" model that came in black.\nFor those who want something a little cozier, there's a fleece option that is\na bit more plush.\n\nThese sleep headphones don't even come close to offering the same sound\nquality as regular headphones in their price range. But they are highly\ncomfortable to sleepers of all types \u2014 side, back, stomach, you name it. They\noffer a snug fit that doesn't feel too tight. Plus, I could use them for 4\nconsecutive nights before they needed to be recharged.\n\n **More:**Can't Sleep With Something on Your Head? Consider a White Noise\nMachine Instead  \n\n2\n\nBest Budget Bluetooth Pair\n\n## Joseche Wireless Sleep Mask Sleep Headphones\n\n2\n\nBest Budget Bluetooth Pair\n\n## Joseche Wireless Sleep Mask Sleep Headphones\n\nShop at Amazon\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Affordable price point\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Your partner will likely hear the audio coming from them\n\nThis pair of sleep headphones allows users to drift off to sleep in complete\ndarkness while listening to their favorite soothing sounds. It pairs with a\nsmartphone or tablet over Bluetooth, meaning you won't have to fuss with any\nannoying cords that'll get in the way.\n\nThe headset uses a Velcro strap for ensuring that you get a tight fit, without\nletting any light enter. Its rechargeable battery offers 9 hours of juice \u2014\nplus, there's even a microphone built-in for taking phone calls.\n\nI appreciate that the eye mask is made of a breathable material that won't get\ntoo hot, and the fabric is machine-washable. It also has easy-to-access\ncontrols for adjusting volume and pausing audio.  \n\n**More:**The Best Meditation Apps to Help You Keep Calm ****\n\n3\n\nA Super Soft and Comfy Headband\n\n## Perytong Sleep Headphones Wireless\n\n3\n\nA Super Soft and Comfy Headband\n\n## Perytong Sleep Headphones Wireless\n\n$20 at Amazon$39 at Walmart\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Great battery life\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * They don't block out external noises\n\nThe Perytong headband is a fully washable, super-soft pair of headphones\nthat'll help lull you to sleep. The headphones are lightweight, and they offer\na stretchy fit with an inner mesh lining to keep you cool.\n\nThis pair features a built-in rechargeable battery that lasts up to 10 hours,\na microphone in case you want to take a call when you wear them outdoors, and\na wireless Bluetooth connection so you don't have to fuss with cables.\n\nThe headphones feature a control panel at their front for skipping tracks or\nadjusting volume. That way, you won't get blinded by your smartphone's display\nat night!\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n4\n\nThe Best at Blocking Background Noise\n\n## soundcore Sleep A10 Bluetooth Earbuds\n\n4\n\nThe Best at Blocking Background Noise\n\n## soundcore Sleep A10 Bluetooth Earbuds\n\nNow 24% Off\n\n$130 at Amazon\n\nCredit: Brandon Carte\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Its case is small and easy to travel with and conveniently doubles as a charger\n  * They do a good job at blocking external noise\n  * Inexpensive and comfortable\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * If they fall out of your ears they are hard to find, especially if your sheets are white\n  * No microphone for phone calls\n\nIf you\u2019re an anxious person with an overactive brain or a nagging voice in\nyour head that just won\u2019t stop, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10 earbuds could\nhelp quiet the noise. These tiny earbuds have Bluetooth, meaning you can use\nany app as a music source to play anything from rustling leaves, to the sound\nof the ocean, or rain sounds to help you drift off to sleep.\n\nThe earbuds are quite comfortable, but occasionally, I would wake up with one\nof them loose in my sheets. Fortunately, Anker includes various tips and wings\nof different sizes to ensure they stay in place securely. Even though you may\nthink the default size fits, I recommend trying multiple tips to ensure the\nproper fit.\n\nI also tested the similar QuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds, which use active noise-\ncanceling and microphones to mute potentially disrupting sounds. I found that\nthe Anker buds masked sounds just as well and they are much cheaper. Whether\nthere were cars outside my bedroom window, the sound of sirens, or the\nclicking sound of my dog\u2019s nails against my hardwood floors \u2014 the Anker\ndrowned them all out.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the Soundcore Sleep A10 earbuds is their battery\nlife. When I used Bluetooth the longest they\u2019d stay on was just over 6 hours.\nIf you want to stretch battery life further, there\u2019s an auto-sleep mode that\nturns on pre-loaded sounds (which use less battery). Sometimes with the\nsetting enabled, I would notice the transition which would wake me up.\n\n5\n\nBest Audio Library\n\n## HoomBand Sleep Headphones\n\n5\n\nBest Audio Library\n\n## HoomBand Sleep Headphones\n\n$80 at Amazon\n\nCredit: HoomBand\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * The speakers have padding on them to make them more plush and comfortable\n  * Has a useful LED light that indicates when the headset is ready to pair\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * The inner speakers are hard to adjust\n  * Uses microUSB instead of USB-C\n\nThe HoomBand is another headband-style pair of sleep headphones, but what\nseparates it from other options is its complimentary app, which packs hundreds\nof hypnotic stories, guided meditations, relaxing nature sounds, and white\nnoise that\u2019ll gently lull you to sleep.\n\nThe HoomBand is made of an elastic lightweight fabric that\u2019s super soft and\ncomfortable. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this option for people who run hot.\nI'm not a hot sleeper and felt pretty toasty while wearing it and ended up\ntaking them off in the middle of the night.\n\nAnother minor annoyance, despite the fact that the HoomBand's inner earpads\ncan be adjusted and moved around to allow them to properly line up with your\nears, there just isn\u2019t a lot of slack on the inner cords, making the whole\nprocess rather difficult.\n\nOn the plus side, the HoomBand comes in two sizes to accommodate various head\nsizes. Overall, the HoomBand delivers decent audio quality, has a lengthy\n10-hour battery, and packed plenty of content to help lull me to sleep.\n\n6\n\nBest Wired Pair\n\n## CozyPhones Contour Series Sleep Headphones\u200b\n\n6\n\nBest Wired Pair\n\n## CozyPhones Contour Series Sleep Headphones\u200b\n\nNow 15% Off\n\n$17 at Amazon\n\nCredit: Brandon Carte\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Long cord\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Fleece material is a little scratchy\n\nIf you don't want to splurge on wireless sleep headphones, consider this wired\npair instead. CozyPhones are a comfortable and affordable option, and because\nthey're wired, you don't have to worry about charging them.\n\nI tested the CozyPhone Contour series, which has a mesh lining over the\nstandard pair's all-fleece design. The breathable fabric helps keep things\ncool, but the CozyPhones only come in one size, so they may not fit everyone.\n\nDuring my testing period, I found that the headphones\u2019 52-inch cord was plenty\nlong enough to keep my smartphone on a nightstand, but if you toss and turn a\nlot, you\u2019ll probably want to keep the attached device with you in the bed.\nThis way, your phone won\u2019t fall off the nightstand when you inevitably roll\nover and tug on the cord.\n\nThe CozyPhones have a braided cable that never seems to get tangled, which is\na nice touch. Its sound quality is clear, and at maximum volume, the\nheadphones are loud enough to drown out snoring.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n7\n\nBest Earbuds-Style\n\n## Kokoon Nightbuds Sleep Headphones\n\n7\n\nBest Earbuds-Style\n\n## Kokoon Nightbuds Sleep Headphones\n\nNow 20% Off\n\n\u00a3232 at kokoon.io\n\nCredit: Trevor Raab\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Bluetooth connectivity ensures you can listen to anything\n  * Travel case is included\n  * Impressive 10-hour battery life\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * If you move around a lot in your sleep, the cord could stretch and get caught on your pillows \n  * Sleep data is difficult to interpret and isn\u2019t very detailed\n\nThe NightBuds are an intelligently designed pair of in-ear headphones that\npack a heart rate sensor to help you track the length and quality of your\nsleep (it gives you a rating between 0 and 100). Their neckband-style design\nwith a wavy wire connecting the two earbuds may pose a problem for back\nsleepers, since the centered control module rests behind your head. Given the\nNightBuds\u2019 cable and their numerous-sized ear tips, you\u2019re sure to find a\ntight seal so that they\u2019ll stay in your ears throughout the night.\n\nDuring my tests, I found that the earbuds did a better-than-average job at\nblocking out external noises. I\u2019m a side sleeper, and found them to be quite\ncomfortable: I practically forgot they were in my ears. It\u2019s worth mentioning\nthat I regularly use in-ear headphones, so I didn\u2019t have to get adjusted to\nthem.\n\nUnlike the Bose Sleepbuds II, the NightBuds use Bluetooth so you can stream\nanything. The app packs several guided relaxation exercises, natural\nsoundscapes, podcasts, white noise, and other calming music and sounds. As for\nsleep data, I found that the NightBuds didn\u2019t provide helpful or detailed\nenough sleep tracking data. I think you\u2019re better off relying on a dedicated\ntracker such as the Oura Ring.\n\nGiven their steep price point, we think most buyers are better off shopping\nfor a different pair of sleep headphones, but if you're a side sleeper in\nsearch of in-ear sleep headphones that effectively block background noise,\nthey might just be the perfect thing to help you slip into a deep slumber.\n\nBrandon Carte\n\nSenior Electronics Editor\n\nBrandon Carte has been covering technology at BestProducts.com since 2017,\nwhere he's been writing about the latest gadgets, appliances, and scouring the\ninternet for the products that make life easier.
