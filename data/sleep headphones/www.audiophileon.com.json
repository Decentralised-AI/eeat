One method that\nseems to get good results is listening to music,  **white noise, or ASMR** to\nhelp you drift off to sleep.\n\nSadly, **most headphones and earphones are unsuitable for sleeping** and can\ncause significant discomfort. While you can find many **comfortable\nheadphones** **,** they might still not work when lying down.\n\nIt's common to fall asleep initially but wake up again once they roll onto\ntheir side or front. **We suggest the headphones below that can work with you\nto improve your ability to fall asleep and increase sleep quality.**\n\nWhat should you look for when selecting the best headphones for sleeping? I\nwanted this article to be both a buyer's guide for these types of headphones\nand a place to discuss other methods and alternatives to headphones that can\nhelp you fall asleep.\n\nBelow I have listed what is, in my opinion, the best headphones for sleeping\nto help you rest the whole night. In this list, I include some specialist\ndevices (at various budgets) designed to improve sleep quality.\n\n* * *\n\n### Our 3 Favourite Models\n\n#### Best Earbuds Wireless\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n#### Best Earbuds For Sleeping\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n#### Best Headband Headphone\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n## 11 Best Headphones for Sleeping\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. Sleepphones Effortless\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **The fleece-lined headband is exceptionally soft and comfortable**\n\n  *  **The low profile design enables side sleeping**\n\n  *  **The sound is smooth and relaxed**\n\n  *  **Bluetooth enhances your freedom**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **More expensive than wired headphones**\n\n  *  **It can get a little hot in warmer climates with no air conditioning**\n\n#### Review\n\nThe Sleepphones are our test winners for the best headphones for sleeping.\n\nThe Sleepphones Effortless are the best headphones for sleeping. **They are\nalso wireless and feature induction charging, making them the most intuitive\nand easy to live with**. It's the absolute best of all the models I have ever\ntried and something that completely transformed my sleep patterns.\n\nWe can see what sets them apart by focusing on the main selling points. They\nare a headband design that is a highly comfortable way to sleep as it is less\nprone to coming dislodged when rolling about in your sleep. Traditional\nheadphone slips off, and earbuds can be pulled out.\n\n**With the Sleepphones, I found, more often than not, when I woke up in the\nmorning, they were still on my head the way I had left them the night\nbefore.**\n\nAnother essential feature is the Sleepphones use extremely thin speaker\ndiaphragms that are flexible and don't cause discomfort when side sleeping.\nThe materials used allow them to be flexible, so they conform with your ears,\nand the whole thing is covered with generous padding to enhance comfort\nfurther.\n\nFinally, the essential feature of the Sleepphones is wireless. No longer will\nyou be tethered in your sleep. If you wake up and need to go to the bathroom\nor get a glass of water, you don\u2019t have to go through the routine of\ndisconnecting your phone or music player and resetting everything when you\nreturn. It\u2019s remarkably freeing and the one reason I recommend this model over\nall others.\n\n **Battery life is a fantastic 12 hours; they can be recharged in just 2\nhours.**\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 2\\. SZHTFX Sleep Earbuds\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Small, low profile and very comfortable**\n\n  *  **Integrated ear hook for stability**\n\n  *  **Better than Bose Sleepbuds at a fraction of the cost**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Propietary silicone tips**\n\n  *  **4-hour battery life (tested)**\n\n#### Review\n\nThe name is terrible, that\u2019s for sure; I\u2019d like to buy a vowel. But these are\nthe best wireless earbuds for sleeping we tested this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain and something you need to get in hand to understand just\nhow small the SZHTFX is. They are ergonomically one of the most comfortable\nsets on our test and cause no discomfort when side sleeping.\n\nDespite the small size, you still get Bluetooth 5.3 for better efficiency and\nconnection. Built-in touch controls and 4 hours of battery life will help you\nget to sleep.\n\nThey won\u2019t last the whole night, but if you are looking for something for\nthose first few hours and don\u2019t like sleeping with cables or using bulky\nheadbands, this could be perfect.\n\n **As a side, not they also work great as day-to-day earphones.**\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 3\\. MaxRocks Sleeping earphones\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **The petite size makes them disappear in the ear**\n\n  *  **Double flange eartips keep them securely locked in place while you sleep**\n\n  *  **They are very inexpensive and can also be used as regular earbuds**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Many phones do not have a headphone jack, so users may need a separate device or dongle to play music.**\n\n#### Review\n\n **These are great headphones for side sleepers. My number three pick is**\n**the Maxrock Sleep Earphones**.\n\nTraditionally, I would advocate sleeping with earphones because when you roll\nto your side, they push more profoundly into your ear canal and cause\ndiscomfort.\n\nThe Maxrock, though, is so small and unobtrusive that I can comfortably sleep\nwith them all night, yet at the same time, if you lose them in the dark, good\nluck finding them.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 4\\. Toppoint Wireless Sleep Headphones and Eyemask\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Similar functionality to the Sleephones model listed above**\n\n  *  **Very affordable with competitive pricing**\n\n  *  **Comfortable inner liner material that breathes well**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Speakers are thicker than Sleephones, making them less ideal for people who side sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese non-brand models are popping up and can be found by several sellers\nonline. They are an all-in-one system that combines an eye mask and headphones\ninto one package.\n\nMany people will like this because it saves the fumble in the dark for two\nitems instead of just one.\n\n **I was initially skeptical** , but they have held up well, cost less than 20\ndollars, and go for 9 hours on a single charge. However, there is a noticeable\ndifference in the quality and design between these and the Sleepphones we\nlisted as number 1.\n\nThey are a little less robust and have much thicker speakers, which can lead\nto a bit of discomfort with hard pillows.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 5\\. Adaptive Sound Technologies Sound + Sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **A great alternative if you can\u2019t use headphones when sleeping**\n\n  *  **Lots of preset sounds to choose from**\n\n  *  **Intuitive button layout**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Best used alone or with someone who doesn't mind having ambient sound playing whilst sleeping**\n\n#### Review\n\n **It might not be headphones, but Sound+ Sleep is one of the market's most\nadvanced sleep speakers and ambient noise machines**.\n\nI was impressed with the new Sound + Sleep, so I thought it was worthy of\ninclusion on this list. Headphones might not work for you, but plenty of\noptions remain to get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nDuring my battles with lifelong insomnia, **I have tried numerous white noise\nmachines, but none have been as intuitive and versatile as Sound Sleep**.\nAfter a few days of use, you will know the button layout well enough to use it\nin the dark, and despite having many options, it\u2019s very intuitive.\n\nThis unit is a noise machine with multiple settings and realistic sounds that\ncan be easily adjusted through the panel controls. **There are ten sounds** ,\nbut you can modify them by adjusting the ambient and richness settings.\n\nThe only negative is that the large twist dial isn\u2019t for adjusting volume but\nfor selecting the sound you wish to use to help you sleep. For me, volume\nadjustment here would have been better.\n\nIt is the best speaker of this kind I have tried, and it stops me from using\nmy phone in bed.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 6\\. Final Audio Design E3000\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Audiophile Sound Quality**\n\n  *  **Small size**\n\n  *  **Breathable open-back BAM technology**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Cables could interfere with sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThey are small and comfortable, making them perfect earbuds for sleeping, but\nthey are also considered one of the **best-sounding cheap earbuds** on the\nmarket.\n\nI wanted to throw in the e3000 as a bit of an all-rounder. It's something you\ncan sleep in but something that also sounds great during the day. Something\nthat you can travel with but not have to bring an extra set of earbuds for a\nspecific task\n\n **We reviewed the e3000** earlier this year and were blown away by the sound\nquality, and naturally, thanks to its diminutive size, it makes a perfect\nearbud for sleeping with.\n\nThe barrel is very small thanks to the use of micro driver technology, and the\ncable protrudes downwards and not straight out like on an Etymotic studio IEM.\nThis way, **they will disappear in your ears and not protrude from the side,\nadding pressure and discomfort.**\n\nThink of it as a premium upgrade to the Maxrock version I listed above.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 7\\. MUsicozy Eyemask with Built in Speakers\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Inexpensive**\n\n  *  **Perforated silk material for enhanced comfort**\n\n  *  **3D eye relief to relieve pressure**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **8 hours of battery life in testing might not be enough for a full night\u2019s sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese are very similar in design to the headband above but are more\nreminiscent of eye masks.\n\nMany people who have trouble sleeping also use an eye mask, so combining both\nitems into one product is a good idea.\n\nI liked these (apart from the low price), as well as the built-in audio\ncontrols for volume play and pause, which come in handy in the dark as you\ndon\u2019t need to fumble around to control them with your phone.  \n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 8\\. Zero Audio Tenore DX200\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Great sound quality**\n\n  *  **Angles Cable**\n\n  *  **Perfect size**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Slightly bass forward**\n\n#### Review\n\nAnother great option if you want to own an amazing-sounding set of earphones.\n\nThe Zero Audio DX200 has had a lot of praise in the past due to them sounding\nlike sets of earphones many times their price.\n\nI was using them for sleeping for a while due to the compact design. The body\nis small and, when inserted, causes no discomfort from side sleeping. The\nangle of the cable exit also keeps them away from your skin when side-\nsleeping.\n\nI also liked the versatility, knowing that I could also use them for listening\nto music during the day for not much more money than a dedicated slumber set.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 9\\. Sleepphones\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Soft and Comfortable**\n\n  *  **Low profile drivers**\n\n  *  **Cheaper than competitors**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **It doesn\u2019t have the benefits of wireless charging**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese Perytong Bluetooth headphones are designed for sleeping and while at\nfirst glance they look like many of the other headband style models on this\nlist a few things set them apart and make them one of the best models in 2023.\n\n **The control system is directly on the front of your head so it doesn\u2019t\nmatter what side you are lying on you can easily control them from any\nposition.**\n\nI also found them incredibly comfortable due to the breathable mesh on the\ninner liner. Other companies use a tighter fabric that collects sweat rather\nthan wicking it away like the Perytongs.\n\nFinally, the price is unbeatable. They constantly seem to price these less\nthan the competition, but in my experience, it is actually a better product.\nNow if we could get them to include wireless charging they would have put\nsleepphones out of business by now.\n\nIt is well worth trying and is available in different color options.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 10\\. Agptek Sleep Earbuds\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are cheap and small and sit securely in the ear with no strain relief to\ncause discomfort. They may not sound as good as some of the higher-end models\non this list, but they have an inline control, so you don\u2019t have to reach for\nyour phone or music player in the middle of the night.\n\nStudies show that blue light can seriously disturb your sleep pattern, so the\nability to control your volume without looking at a screen should help you\nsleep longer and deeper.\n\nThanks to the metal body, a budget option will give you many years of use due\nto their solid build quality.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 11\\. YogaSleep Dohm Fan Based Sleep Machine\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dohm is one of the market's oldest and most reliable sleep machines.\n\nThe Dohm has been around since 1962 and is the most famous white noise machine\never made. This current version has two settings and a real fan inside. It\nproduces natural, realistic white noise to soothe you to sleep and is\nadjustable via the venting system.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Alternatives to Using Headphones for Sleeping\n\n### 1\\. Foam Earplugs\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nNo, not the set you got at a hotel or some other rubbish off-cut of foam.\nAfter trying many different noise-blocking earplugs for sleeping in the past,\nI have pretty much settled on the perfect ones\u2014the **Howard Leight Laser Lite\nPlugs.**\n\n **Don't be tempted by any other brand or even HL's higher decibel-rated\nmodels** ; the ones you want are the yellow and pink laser lite.  These are\nthe best and comfiest earplugs I have ever used for sleeping, and I highly\nrecommend them.\n\nThey last upwards of 10 uses per set, and a box of 200 pairs should only cost\nyou about $20, so you can buy in bulk on these and save big.\n\n **I cannot stress enough the benefit I have had since I started using these**\n; they are so comfy and block out much of the external noise. These are game-\nchangers for me.\n\n### 2\\. Custom Molded Earplugs\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nI succeeded with custom-molded earplugs, even though I now prefer the\ndisposable kind mentioned above.\n\nOf all the models I have used, I recommend trying the Decibullz Custom Molded\nEarplugs.\n\nThese are a set of DIY custom molds that you make at home, and they fit\nprecisely to your outer ear.\n\nThe process is a bit tricky, so get some help if you think you need it, but it\ntakes about 10 mins to set them into reusable earplugs that block out much\nexternal noise.\n\n### 3\\. Sangean Pillow Speakers\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nSometimes I wish I could be single again to go back to using a pillow with\ninbuilt speakers.  This is something I used to do and for me was the best\nsolution to get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nI went through a range of smart pillows and Bluetooth pillows with speakers\nbuilt in but ultimately, while i liked the sound, the pillow was the part that\nlet these products down. It was almost as if all the thought went into putting\ntech inside but very little care was put into how comfortable the user would\nbe.\n\nThen I found the best solution in the Sangean Pillow Speakers.\n\nThis lets me use my favorite pillow ( **the amazing Tempur Breeze Cooling\nPillow if you were wondering**) and install the speaker into it. Turns our the\nsound of the Sangean was perfect as was the convenience of an inline control.\n\nTwo things to note before you go this route. Fist this is not a viable option\nif you share a bed with someone as they may be disturbed by the sound. Second,\ndefinitely purchase the powered version that offers far better sound quality.\n\nA great solution and the best alternative to sleeping with headphones if it\nsuits your lifestyle.\n\n* * *\n\n## Top 5 Tips to Help You Sleep Better\n\n  1.  **Stick to a sleep schedule** : Set a routine sleep schedule by sleeping and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This routine will help regulate your body's internal clock and promote better sleep.\n\n  2.  **Create a sleep-friendly environment** : Make your bedroom as comfortable and conducive to sleep as possible. Keep the room cool, dark, and quiet. Use comfortable pillows and bedding, and limit the use of electronics before bedtime.\n\n  3.  **Avoid stimulants before bedtime** : Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime, as they can disrupt your sleep, resulting in restlessness and insomnia.\n\n  4.  **Practice relaxation techniques** : Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga to calm your mind and body before bedtime. This will help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\n  5.  **Exercise regularly** : Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality, especially when done regularly. Ensure that you exercise at least 30 minutes a day, but not too close to bedtime, as it can also cause restlessness.\n\n### Try combining Your headphones with this method to get to sleep faster!\n\n **The military sleep method, also known as the \"4-7-8\" method, is designed to\nhelp individuals fall asleep quickly, usually within 2 minutes or less.**\n\n  * **To use this method, begin by lying comfortably and fully relaxing your body.**\n\n  *  **Start by taking a deep breath through your nose and inhaling for a count of 4 seconds.**\n\n  *  **Hold this breath for 7 seconds, promoting a sense of calm and reducing anxiety.**\n\n  *  **After holding your breath, exhale slowly and control through your mouth for 8 seconds, aiming to release all the air from your lungs.**\n\nThis breathing cycle should be repeated thrice, totaling four breath cycles.\nThe theory behind the method is that it helps to calm the nervous system and\ncan effectively promote a quicker onset of sleep.\n\n**To enhance its effectiveness, pair it with other relaxation techniques,**\nsuch as visualizing a calming scene or progressively relaxing each part of\nyour body, starting from the toes upwards.\n\n* * *\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Build Quality\n\nMost headphones are used while awake; thus, they are not put under the strain\nor abuse you might see when sleeping on your headphones.\n\nWhen you sleep, you will contact the pillow and turn and roll. It can cause\nwear and strain on ordinary headphones, so you need tough and durable models\nready to take the abuse.\n\n**We are looking for headphones designed explicitly for sleeping or existing\nmodels so we can adapt them to suit this purpose** , and the materials used\nand the type of construction can play a significant role in long-term\ndurability.\n\n### What headphones are comfortable for side sleepers?\n\nComfort is a hugely critical factor in the buying process. After all, if you\naren't comfortable, you will have problems falling asleep quickly and even\nmore trouble staying asleep.\n\nYou want to choose headphones that you would be happy to wear when you try to\nget a  **full 8 hours of sleep** without experiencing any pain or discomfort.\n\n**If you have any issues with particular styles of headphones during the day,\nthen you can bet that this will be further amplified at night.**  The\nheadphones we have chosen below are better for side sleepers, but they might\nnot be perfect. In this category, some compromises may need to be made.\n\nYou may also find a period of adjustment where you need to get comfortable\nwith how you wear your new headphones when sleeping. With time and the right\npillow, discomfort can be managed but not tolerated.\n\n### Is sound Quality important when choosing headphones for sleeping?\n\n **The sound is hugely important when choosing a set of headphones** , **but\nyour priorities should be somewhat different when choosing them to sleep in.**\n\nIn this case, you shouldn't worry about out-and-out fidelity; instead, you\nshould be looking for something that doesn't do anything jarring or annoying\nthat might put you off your sleep. Examples of this could be a distracting\nbackground hiss or even a sharp treble spike. Both of these can be off-putting\nenough that you start thinking about the sound rather than getting to sleep.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, **you want your headphones or earphones to be smooth\nand inoffensive**. Neutral and balanced headphones with low impedance do well\nhere, but I also would look past a set of headphones with toned-down high\nnotes and some warmth to the presentation.\n\n### Over-Ear Headphones vs. On-Ear Headphones vs. In-ear headphones\n\n **Not all headphone styles are best suited for sleeping** ; you will probably\nknow what you are looking for from the start.\n\nA bulky full-size set of headphones will have trouble staying on your head and\nthus give you very little room for movement. In-ear headphones (earphones) may\npush deep into the canal if you sleep on your side.\n\nWe have included below workarounds for existing designs and models that will\nwork better than others.\n\nAdditionally, several companies have designed earphones, especially for sleep.\nSome of these are unique and not what you would want to be seen on the street,\nbut they are fantastic for use in bed.\n\n### Can Sleeping With Headphones Kill You?\n\nThe chances of your headphones killing you in your sleep are so low that it\u2019s\nalmost negligible, but there have been cases. This usually resolves to two\nareas: lack of awareness and the cord tangling around one\u2019s airways.\n\n### Does sleeping with headphones cause cancer?\n\nSurprisingly, this question gets asked a lot, but there is no evidence linking\nan increased chance of cancer with the use of headphones.\n\nMost of the concern concerns wireless or Bluetooth headphones and **false\nclaims that prolonged exposure over a night\u2019s sleep would increase your\nchances of developing the disease.**\n\nThis is not the case and has been debunked via studies over the past few\nyears. If you want to read more about this subject, read this informative\narticle by the **American Cancer Society, which briefly explains how the radio\nfrequencies in Bluetooth headphones** affect our cells.\n\n### Is it safe to sleep with headphones on?\n\nSleeping with headphones is generally considered safe if the volume does not\nexceed 85db. There are many health benefits from a good night\u2019s rest, such as\nreduced stress and fatigue. So, if headphones are something that helps you\nsleep better, it is a good idea to use them.\n\nYou should, however, remain vigilant with where you wear your headphones when\nsleeping in places where you should be situationally aware or may need to hear\nan alarm, for example.\n\n* * *\n\nagptekbest headphones for side sleepersbest headphones for sleepbest\nheadphones for sleepingbest noise machines for sleepingbest sleep devicesbest\nsleeping earplugsbest white noise machines for sleepingbuyers\nguidecozyphonescustom earplugsearbudsearplugs for\nsleepingheadphoensheadphonesheadphones for insomniaheadphones for sleepinghow\nto sleep with headphones oninsomnialistSleepacesleeping headphonessleeping\nwith headphonessleepphonesspeakers for sleepingtop 10white noisewhite noise\nmachinewhite noise machine for sleepbest headphones for sleeping 2023best\nearbuds for side sleepersbest earbuds for sleepingbest wireless earbuds for\nsleepingbluetooth earbuds for sleepingwireless sleep earbuds\n\nAudiophile On\n\nAudiophile On is dedicated to bringing reviews of high-end portable audio\nproducts with an easy-to-understand format.

One method that\nseems to get good results is listening to music,  **white noise, or ASMR** to\nhelp you drift off to sleep.\n\nSadly, **most headphones and earphones are unsuitable for sleeping** and can\ncause significant discomfort. While you can find many **comfortable\nheadphones** **,** they might still not work when lying down.\n\nIt's common to fall asleep initially but wake up again once they roll onto\ntheir side or front. **We suggest the headphones below that can work with you\nto improve your ability to fall asleep and increase sleep quality.**\n\nWhat should you look for when selecting the best headphones for sleeping? I\nwanted this article to be both a buyer's guide for these types of headphones\nand a place to discuss other methods and alternatives to headphones that can\nhelp you fall asleep.\n\nBelow I have listed what is, in my opinion, the best headphones for sleeping\nto help you rest the whole night. In this list, I include some specialist\ndevices (at various budgets) designed to improve sleep quality.\n\n* * *\n\n### Our 3 Favourite Models\n\n#### Best Earbuds Wireless\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n#### Best Earbuds For Sleeping\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n#### Best Headband Headphone\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n## 11 Best Headphones for Sleeping\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. Sleepphones Effortless\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **The fleece-lined headband is exceptionally soft and comfortable**\n\n  *  **The low profile design enables side sleeping**\n\n  *  **The sound is smooth and relaxed**\n\n  *  **Bluetooth enhances your freedom**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **More expensive than wired headphones**\n\n  *  **It can get a little hot in warmer climates with no air conditioning**\n\n#### Review\n\nThe Sleepphones are our test winners for the best headphones for sleeping.\n\nThe Sleepphones Effortless are the best headphones for sleeping. **They are\nalso wireless and feature induction charging, making them the most intuitive\nand easy to live with**. It's the absolute best of all the models I have ever\ntried and something that completely transformed my sleep patterns.\n\nWe can see what sets them apart by focusing on the main selling points. They\nare a headband design that is a highly comfortable way to sleep as it is less\nprone to coming dislodged when rolling about in your sleep. Traditional\nheadphone slips off, and earbuds can be pulled out.\n\n**With the Sleepphones, I found, more often than not, when I woke up in the\nmorning, they were still on my head the way I had left them the night\nbefore.**\n\nAnother essential feature is the Sleepphones use extremely thin speaker\ndiaphragms that are flexible and don't cause discomfort when side sleeping.\nThe materials used allow them to be flexible, so they conform with your ears,\nand the whole thing is covered with generous padding to enhance comfort\nfurther.\n\nFinally, the essential feature of the Sleepphones is wireless. No longer will\nyou be tethered in your sleep. If you wake up and need to go to the bathroom\nor get a glass of water, you don\u2019t have to go through the routine of\ndisconnecting your phone or music player and resetting everything when you\nreturn. It\u2019s remarkably freeing and the one reason I recommend this model over\nall others.\n\n **Battery life is a fantastic 12 hours; they can be recharged in just 2\nhours.**\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 2\\. SZHTFX Sleep Earbuds\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Small, low profile and very comfortable**\n\n  *  **Integrated ear hook for stability**\n\n  *  **Better than Bose Sleepbuds at a fraction of the cost**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Propietary silicone tips**\n\n  *  **4-hour battery life (tested)**\n\n#### Review\n\nThe name is terrible, that\u2019s for sure; I\u2019d like to buy a vowel. But these are\nthe best wireless earbuds for sleeping we tested this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain and something you need to get in hand to understand just\nhow small the SZHTFX is. They are ergonomically one of the most comfortable\nsets on our test and cause no discomfort when side sleeping.\n\nDespite the small size, you still get Bluetooth 5.3 for better efficiency and\nconnection. Built-in touch controls and 4 hours of battery life will help you\nget to sleep.\n\nThey won\u2019t last the whole night, but if you are looking for something for\nthose first few hours and don\u2019t like sleeping with cables or using bulky\nheadbands, this could be perfect.\n\n **As a side, not they also work great as day-to-day earphones.**\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 3\\. MaxRocks Sleeping earphones\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **The petite size makes them disappear in the ear**\n\n  *  **Double flange eartips keep them securely locked in place while you sleep**\n\n  *  **They are very inexpensive and can also be used as regular earbuds**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Many phones do not have a headphone jack, so users may need a separate device or dongle to play music.**\n\n#### Review\n\n **These are great headphones for side sleepers. My number three pick is**\n**the Maxrock Sleep Earphones**.\n\nTraditionally, I would advocate sleeping with earphones because when you roll\nto your side, they push more profoundly into your ear canal and cause\ndiscomfort.\n\nThe Maxrock, though, is so small and unobtrusive that I can comfortably sleep\nwith them all night, yet at the same time, if you lose them in the dark, good\nluck finding them.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 4\\. Toppoint Wireless Sleep Headphones and Eyemask\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Similar functionality to the Sleephones model listed above**\n\n  *  **Very affordable with competitive pricing**\n\n  *  **Comfortable inner liner material that breathes well**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Speakers are thicker than Sleephones, making them less ideal for people who side sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese non-brand models are popping up and can be found by several sellers\nonline. They are an all-in-one system that combines an eye mask and headphones\ninto one package.\n\nMany people will like this because it saves the fumble in the dark for two\nitems instead of just one.\n\n **I was initially skeptical** , but they have held up well, cost less than 20\ndollars, and go for 9 hours on a single charge. However, there is a noticeable\ndifference in the quality and design between these and the Sleepphones we\nlisted as number 1.\n\nThey are a little less robust and have much thicker speakers, which can lead\nto a bit of discomfort with hard pillows.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 5\\. Adaptive Sound Technologies Sound + Sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **A great alternative if you can\u2019t use headphones when sleeping**\n\n  *  **Lots of preset sounds to choose from**\n\n  *  **Intuitive button layout**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Best used alone or with someone who doesn't mind having ambient sound playing whilst sleeping**\n\n#### Review\n\n **It might not be headphones, but Sound+ Sleep is one of the market's most\nadvanced sleep speakers and ambient noise machines**.\n\nI was impressed with the new Sound + Sleep, so I thought it was worthy of\ninclusion on this list. Headphones might not work for you, but plenty of\noptions remain to get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nDuring my battles with lifelong insomnia, **I have tried numerous white noise\nmachines, but none have been as intuitive and versatile as Sound Sleep**.\nAfter a few days of use, you will know the button layout well enough to use it\nin the dark, and despite having many options, it\u2019s very intuitive.\n\nThis unit is a noise machine with multiple settings and realistic sounds that\ncan be easily adjusted through the panel controls. **There are ten sounds** ,\nbut you can modify them by adjusting the ambient and richness settings.\n\nThe only negative is that the large twist dial isn\u2019t for adjusting volume but\nfor selecting the sound you wish to use to help you sleep. For me, volume\nadjustment here would have been better.\n\nIt is the best speaker of this kind I have tried, and it stops me from using\nmy phone in bed.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 6\\. Final Audio Design E3000\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Audiophile Sound Quality**\n\n  *  **Small size**\n\n  *  **Breathable open-back BAM technology**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Cables could interfere with sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThey are small and comfortable, making them perfect earbuds for sleeping, but\nthey are also considered one of the **best-sounding cheap earbuds** on the\nmarket.\n\nI wanted to throw in the e3000 as a bit of an all-rounder. It's something you\ncan sleep in but something that also sounds great during the day. Something\nthat you can travel with but not have to bring an extra set of earbuds for a\nspecific task\n\n **We reviewed the e3000** earlier this year and were blown away by the sound\nquality, and naturally, thanks to its diminutive size, it makes a perfect\nearbud for sleeping with.\n\nThe barrel is very small thanks to the use of micro driver technology, and the\ncable protrudes downwards and not straight out like on an Etymotic studio IEM.\nThis way, **they will disappear in your ears and not protrude from the side,\nadding pressure and discomfort.**\n\nThink of it as a premium upgrade to the Maxrock version I listed above.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 7\\. MUsicozy Eyemask with Built in Speakers\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Inexpensive**\n\n  *  **Perforated silk material for enhanced comfort**\n\n  *  **3D eye relief to relieve pressure**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **8 hours of battery life in testing might not be enough for a full night\u2019s sleep**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese are very similar in design to the headband above but are more\nreminiscent of eye masks.\n\nMany people who have trouble sleeping also use an eye mask, so combining both\nitems into one product is a good idea.\n\nI liked these (apart from the low price), as well as the built-in audio\ncontrols for volume play and pause, which come in handy in the dark as you\ndon\u2019t need to fumble around to control them with your phone.  \n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 8\\. Zero Audio Tenore DX200\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Great sound quality**\n\n  *  **Angles Cable**\n\n  *  **Perfect size**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **Slightly bass forward**\n\n#### Review\n\nAnother great option if you want to own an amazing-sounding set of earphones.\n\nThe Zero Audio DX200 has had a lot of praise in the past due to them sounding\nlike sets of earphones many times their price.\n\nI was using them for sleeping for a while due to the compact design. The body\nis small and, when inserted, causes no discomfort from side sleeping. The\nangle of the cable exit also keeps them away from your skin when side-\nsleeping.\n\nI also liked the versatility, knowing that I could also use them for listening\nto music during the day for not much more money than a dedicated slumber set.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 9\\. Sleepphones\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Pros:\n\n  *  **Soft and Comfortable**\n\n  *  **Low profile drivers**\n\n  *  **Cheaper than competitors**\n\n#### Cons:\n\n  *  **It doesn\u2019t have the benefits of wireless charging**\n\n#### Review\n\nThese Perytong Bluetooth headphones are designed for sleeping and while at\nfirst glance they look like many of the other headband style models on this\nlist a few things set them apart and make them one of the best models in 2023.\n\n **The control system is directly on the front of your head so it doesn\u2019t\nmatter what side you are lying on you can easily control them from any\nposition.**\n\nI also found them incredibly comfortable due to the breathable mesh on the\ninner liner. Other companies use a tighter fabric that collects sweat rather\nthan wicking it away like the Perytongs.\n\nFinally, the price is unbeatable. They constantly seem to price these less\nthan the competition, but in my experience, it is actually a better product.\nNow if we could get them to include wireless charging they would have put\nsleepphones out of business by now.\n\nIt is well worth trying and is available in different color options.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n### 10\\. Agptek Sleep Earbuds\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are cheap and small and sit securely in the ear with no strain relief to\ncause discomfort. They may not sound as good as some of the higher-end models\non this list, but they have an inline control, so you don\u2019t have to reach for\nyour phone or music player in the middle of the night.\n\nStudies show that blue light can seriously disturb your sleep pattern, so the\nability to control your volume without looking at a screen should help you\nsleep longer and deeper.\n\nThanks to the metal body, a budget option will give you many years of use due\nto their solid build quality.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n### 11\\. YogaSleep Dohm Fan Based Sleep Machine\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dohm is one of the market's oldest and most reliable sleep machines.\n\nThe Dohm has been around since 1962 and is the most famous white noise machine\never made. This current version has two settings and a real fan inside. It\nproduces natural, realistic white noise to soothe you to sleep and is\nadjustable via the venting system.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Alternatives to Using Headphones for Sleeping\n\n### 1\\. Foam Earplugs\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nNo, not the set you got at a hotel or some other rubbish off-cut of foam.\nAfter trying many different noise-blocking earplugs for sleeping in the past,\nI have pretty much settled on the perfect ones\u2014the **Howard Leight Laser Lite\nPlugs.**\n\n **Don't be tempted by any other brand or even HL's higher decibel-rated\nmodels** ; the ones you want are the yellow and pink laser lite.  These are\nthe best and comfiest earplugs I have ever used for sleeping, and I highly\nrecommend them.\n\nThey last upwards of 10 uses per set, and a box of 200 pairs should only cost\nyou about $20, so you can buy in bulk on these and save big.\n\n **I cannot stress enough the benefit I have had since I started using these**\n; they are so comfy and block out much of the external noise. These are game-\nchangers for me.\n\n### 2\\. Custom Molded Earplugs\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nI succeeded with custom-molded earplugs, even though I now prefer the\ndisposable kind mentioned above.\n\nOf all the models I have used, I recommend trying the Decibullz Custom Molded\nEarplugs.\n\nThese are a set of DIY custom molds that you make at home, and they fit\nprecisely to your outer ear.\n\nThe process is a bit tricky, so get some help if you think you need it, but it\ntakes about 10 mins to set them into reusable earplugs that block out much\nexternal noise.\n\n### 3\\. Sangean Pillow Speakers\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nSometimes I wish I could be single again to go back to using a pillow with\ninbuilt speakers.  This is something I used to do and for me was the best\nsolution to get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nI went through a range of smart pillows and Bluetooth pillows with speakers\nbuilt in but ultimately, while i liked the sound, the pillow was the part that\nlet these products down. It was almost as if all the thought went into putting\ntech inside but very little care was put into how comfortable the user would\nbe.\n\nThen I found the best solution in the Sangean Pillow Speakers.\n\nThis lets me use my favorite pillow ( **the amazing Tempur Breeze Cooling\nPillow if you were wondering**) and install the speaker into it. Turns our the\nsound of the Sangean was perfect as was the convenience of an inline control.\n\nTwo things to note before you go this route. Fist this is not a viable option\nif you share a bed with someone as they may be disturbed by the sound. Second,\ndefinitely purchase the powered version that offers far better sound quality.\n\nA great solution and the best alternative to sleeping with headphones if it\nsuits your lifestyle.\n\n* * *\n\n## Top 5 Tips to Help You Sleep Better\n\n  1.  **Stick to a sleep schedule** : Set a routine sleep schedule by sleeping and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This routine will help regulate your body's internal clock and promote better sleep.\n\n  2.  **Create a sleep-friendly environment** : Make your bedroom as comfortable and conducive to sleep as possible. Keep the room cool, dark, and quiet. Use comfortable pillows and bedding, and limit the use of electronics before bedtime.\n\n  3.  **Avoid stimulants before bedtime** : Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime, as they can disrupt your sleep, resulting in restlessness and insomnia.\n\n  4.  **Practice relaxation techniques** : Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga to calm your mind and body before bedtime. This will help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.\n\n  5.  **Exercise regularly** : Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality, especially when done regularly. Ensure that you exercise at least 30 minutes a day, but not too close to bedtime, as it can also cause restlessness.\n\n### Try combining Your headphones with this method to get to sleep faster!\n\n **The military sleep method, also known as the \"4-7-8\" method, is designed to\nhelp individuals fall asleep quickly, usually within 2 minutes or less.**\n\n  * **To use this method, begin by lying comfortably and fully relaxing your body.**\n\n  *  **Start by taking a deep breath through your nose and inhaling for a count of 4 seconds.**\n\n  *  **Hold this breath for 7 seconds, promoting a sense of calm and reducing anxiety.**\n\n  *  **After holding your breath, exhale slowly and control through your mouth for 8 seconds, aiming to release all the air from your lungs.**\n\nThis breathing cycle should be repeated thrice, totaling four breath cycles.\nThe theory behind the method is that it helps to calm the nervous system and\ncan effectively promote a quicker onset of sleep.\n\n**To enhance its effectiveness, pair it with other relaxation techniques,**\nsuch as visualizing a calming scene or progressively relaxing each part of\nyour body, starting from the toes upwards.\n\n* * *\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Build Quality\n\nMost headphones are used while awake; thus, they are not put under the strain\nor abuse you might see when sleeping on your headphones.\n\nWhen you sleep, you will contact the pillow and turn and roll. It can cause\nwear and strain on ordinary headphones, so you need tough and durable models\nready to take the abuse.\n\n**We are looking for headphones designed explicitly for sleeping or existing\nmodels so we can adapt them to suit this purpose** , and the materials used\nand the type of construction can play a significant role in long-term\ndurability.\n\n### What headphones are comfortable for side sleepers?\n\nComfort is a hugely critical factor in the buying process. After all, if you\naren't comfortable, you will have problems falling asleep quickly and even\nmore trouble staying asleep.\n\nYou want to choose headphones that you would be happy to wear when you try to\nget a  **full 8 hours of sleep** without experiencing any pain or discomfort.\n\n**If you have any issues with particular styles of headphones during the day,\nthen you can bet that this will be further amplified at night.**  The\nheadphones we have chosen below are better for side sleepers, but they might\nnot be perfect. In this category, some compromises may need to be made.\n\nYou may also find a period of adjustment where you need to get comfortable\nwith how you wear your new headphones when sleeping. With time and the right\npillow, discomfort can be managed but not tolerated.\n\n### Is sound Quality important when choosing headphones for sleeping?\n\n **The sound is hugely important when choosing a set of headphones** , **but\nyour priorities should be somewhat different when choosing them to sleep in.**\n\nIn this case, you shouldn't worry about out-and-out fidelity; instead, you\nshould be looking for something that doesn't do anything jarring or annoying\nthat might put you off your sleep. Examples of this could be a distracting\nbackground hiss or even a sharp treble spike. Both of these can be off-putting\nenough that you start thinking about the sound rather than getting to sleep.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, **you want your headphones or earphones to be smooth\nand inoffensive**. Neutral and balanced headphones with low impedance do well\nhere, but I also would look past a set of headphones with toned-down high\nnotes and some warmth to the presentation.\n\n### Over-Ear Headphones vs. On-Ear Headphones vs. In-ear headphones\n\n **Not all headphone styles are best suited for sleeping** ; you will probably\nknow what you are looking for from the start.\n\nA bulky full-size set of headphones will have trouble staying on your head and\nthus give you very little room for movement. In-ear headphones (earphones) may\npush deep into the canal if you sleep on your side.\n\nWe have included below workarounds for existing designs and models that will\nwork better than others.\n\nAdditionally, several companies have designed earphones, especially for sleep.\nSome of these are unique and not what you would want to be seen on the street,\nbut they are fantastic for use in bed.\n\n### Can Sleeping With Headphones Kill You?\n\nThe chances of your headphones killing you in your sleep are so low that it\u2019s\nalmost negligible, but there have been cases. This usually resolves to two\nareas: lack of awareness and the cord tangling around one\u2019s airways.\n\n### Does sleeping with headphones cause cancer?\n\nSurprisingly, this question gets asked a lot, but there is no evidence linking\nan increased chance of cancer with the use of headphones.\n\nMost of the concern concerns wireless or Bluetooth headphones and **false\nclaims that prolonged exposure over a night\u2019s sleep would increase your\nchances of developing the disease.**\n\nThis is not the case and has been debunked via studies over the past few\nyears. If you want to read more about this subject, read this informative\narticle by the **American Cancer Society, which briefly explains how the radio\nfrequencies in Bluetooth headphones** affect our cells.\n\n### Is it safe to sleep with headphones on?\n\nSleeping with headphones is generally considered safe if the volume does not\nexceed 85db. There are many health benefits from a good night\u2019s rest, such as\nreduced stress and fatigue. So, if headphones are something that helps you\nsleep better, it is a good idea to use them.\n\nYou should, however, remain vigilant with where you wear your headphones when\nsleeping in places where you should be situationally aware or may need to hear\nan alarm, for example.\n\n* * *\n\nagptekbest headphones for side sleepersbest headphones for sleepbest\nheadphones for sleepingbest noise machines for sleepingbest sleep devicesbest\nsleeping earplugsbest white noise machines for sleepingbuyers\nguidecozyphonescustom earplugsearbudsearplugs for\nsleepingheadphoensheadphonesheadphones for insomniaheadphones for sleepinghow\nto sleep with headphones oninsomnialistSleepacesleeping headphonessleeping\nwith headphonessleepphonesspeakers for sleepingtop 10white noisewhite noise\nmachinewhite noise machine for sleepbest headphones for sleeping 2023best\nearbuds for side sleepersbest earbuds for sleepingbest wireless earbuds for\nsleepingbluetooth earbuds for sleepingwireless sleep earbuds\n\nAudiophile On\n\nAudiophile On is dedicated to bringing reviews of high-end portable audio\nproducts with an easy-to-understand format.
