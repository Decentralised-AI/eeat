How to sleep better\n\n# The Best Sleep Headphones (But We Hoped for Better)\n\nBy Lauren Dragan\n\nUpdated August 3, 2023\n\nSave\n\nPhoto: Marki Williams\n\nUnless you are a motionless back-sleeper, most earbuds and headphones are far\ntoo bulky to wear comfortably overnight. Even the smallest pair of true\nwireless earbuds can fall out, become lost, or cause other problems.\n\nSleep headphones are supposed to be the solution for people who want to block\nout sounds, fall asleep to music, or mask issues such as tinnitus\u2014but when we\nset out to find the best sleep headphones, our dreams were dashed. Every pair\nwe tested let us down in some way.\n\nWe still have recommendations to address specific needs, but you should be\nprepared to accept a number of compromises.\n\n### Everything we recommend\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless\n\n## If you dislike wearing earplugs or earbuds\n\nThe headband-style SleepPhones come in different sizes and fabrics, and you\ncan stream any audio to them wirelessly via Bluetooth. But they cost more than\nmany similarly styled competitors.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$100 from Amazon\n\n$100 from SleepPhones\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### Anker Soundcore Sleep A10\n\n## If you need to block or mask sounds\n\nThese wireless earbuds physically block out noises and can play preloaded\nsounds or stream audio from your phone. They\u2019re smaller than other wireless\nearbuds, but people with sensitive ears may find that side-sleeping with them\nis uncomfortable.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$104 from Amazon\n\n$130 from Best Buy\n\n# How we picked\n\n* * *\n\n  * Different styles\n\nSleep headphones come in three styles: wireless earbuds, earmuffs, and\nheadbands with speaker drivers inside.

We set 10\nhours as a minimum.\n\n  * Noise isolation\n\nWe tested pairs that effectively block noise, as well as those that allow\nnoise awareness (which is excellent for caregivers).\n\nRead more\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless\n\n## If you dislike wearing earplugs or earbuds\n\nThe headband-style SleepPhones come in different sizes and fabrics, and you\ncan stream any audio to them wirelessly via Bluetooth. But they cost more than\nmany similarly styled competitors.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$100 from Amazon\n\n$100 from SleepPhones\n\nIf you like to listen to music, watch video, or use a meditation app to help\nyou drift off to sleep, the AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless set delivers\nthe most reliable experience available. They\u2019re the only headband-style sleep\nheadphones we\u2019ve found that offer headbands in different sizes and fabrics, so\nthere\u2019s a better chance they\u2019ll fit you comfortably.\n\nThe flat, felt-covered speakers aren\u2019t painful to lie on, and they produce\nbetter bass than the cheap alternatives do. You can stream audio wirelessly\nfrom any Bluetooth source (be it a smartphone, tablet, or TV), and the 24\nhours of battery life means you\u2019ll get a few nights of rest before needing to\ncharge again. The Bluetooth module and speaker drivers are easier to remove\nthan the pieces in competing models, which makes washing the headband less\narduous.\n\nHowever, the headband-style design could interfere with hair bonnets, dental\nheadgear, or nighttime skin treatments, and folks hoping to block external\nnoise\u2014such as the loud snoring of a partner\u2014may find that the cloth isn\u2019t\nisolating enough. Plus, the $100 price tag may seem steep for headphones that\nyou use only in bed.\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### Anker Soundcore Sleep A10\n\n## If you need to block or mask sounds\n\nThese wireless earbuds physically block out noises and can play preloaded\nsounds or stream audio from your phone. They\u2019re smaller than other wireless\nearbuds, but people with sensitive ears may find that side-sleeping with them\nis uncomfortable.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$104 from Amazon\n\n$130 from Best Buy\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to rest next to a loudly snoring bedmate, near clamorously\ncelebrating neighbors, or close to a construction site, the Anker Soundcore\nSleep A10 earbuds physically isolate your ears from noise, and they can\nfurther mask disturbances by playing white noise and other sounds.\n\nThese diminutive earbuds are far thinner than most true wireless earbuds and\nstay in place securely, so you can roll over and not worry about losing one.\nHowever, they\u2019re still earbuds, so this set isn\u2019t for people with sensitive\nears or those who dislike the feel of something in their ears.\n\nThe A10 set allows you to stream your own audio via Bluetooth, or you can\npreload your choice of soothing sounds from the Soundcore app. However,\nstreaming your own playlist severely reduces the earbuds\u2019 battery life,\ncutting it down from around 10 hours to as low as six hours. But there is an\nauto-sleep mode, which senses when you drift off and transitions to playing\npreloaded sounds.\n\nThe A10 pair has a built-in alarm, too, but it sounds like an old-school alarm\nclock and has no snooze button.\n\n### Sign up for our newsletter\n\nGet Wirecutter\u2019s independent reviews, expert advice, and intensively\nresearched deals sent straight to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\nFor information about our privacy practices, including how to opt out of\nmarketing emails, see our Privacy Policy.

My articles have been featured in Fast Company,\nForbes, the Los Angeles Times, and Time, as well as on _Good Morning America_\n, the BBC World Service, and _NBC Nightly News_.\n\nSenior staff writer Brent Butterworth performed the technical headphone\nmeasurements for this guide. He has been reviewing audio gear professionally\nsince 1990, and is one of the extremely small number of audio journalists\n(maybe two or three total) who own laboratory-grade headphone test equipment.\n\n## Looking for something else?\n\n  * #### The Best Wireless TV Headphones\n\n  * #### The Best Kids Headphones\n\n  * #### The Best Wireless and Wired Headsets\n\n  * #### The Best Labor Day Mattress, Bedding, and Pillow Deals\n\nRead more from Sleep\n\n## Who should get sleep headphones\n\nSleep headphones are for people who have difficulty falling or staying asleep\nand find that audio\u2014be it white noise, music, or meditations\u2014can help.\nTraditional earbuds and headphones are usually uncomfortable to lie on, and\nearbuds can fall out once you sink into your pillow. Sleep headphones are\nsupposed to be soft enough to lie on all night (though many we tested were\nnot), and when they fit properly, they should stay in place until morning.\n\nOf course, headphones aren\u2019t the only sleep-assistance option. If you live\nalone, or if you and the person you share a bedroom with enjoy the same tastes\nin listening material, a small speaker or a white noise machine could serve\nyou just as well. If your aim is simply to block disruptive noises, earplugs\nare a far more economical choice. But for folks who find that earplugs aren\u2019t\nsufficient, or who bunk with someone who isn\u2019t into the same audiobook, TV, or\nASMR bedtime habits, sleep headphones provide a way to drift off to your\nfavorite media without disturbing others.\n\n#### Other sleep-aid options\n\n  * ### The Best Earplugs for Sleeping\n\nWe measured 25 different sets of earplugs and sleep-tested the top contenders\nto find that Mack's Slim Fit Soft Foam Earplugs are the best for most people.\n\n  * ### The Best White Noise Machine\n\nA white noise machine can mask irritating noises that make it hard to sleep or\ndifficult to focus. The LectroFan EVO is the most effective option for the\nprice.\n\n## How we picked and tested\n\nPhoto: Lauren Dragan\n\nWhat people need to sleep comfortably is very personal, and someone might want\nto wear headphones while they\u2019re sleeping for a number of reasons. Some folks\nwant to fall asleep while listening to audio without disturbing a roommate or\npartner. For others, the goal is to muffle and mask disturbances. People with\ntinnitus may need a distraction from the irritating ringing in their ears that\ncan prevent sleep altogether.\n\nNone of the sleep headphones we tested met all of our criteria. Each of them\nhad at least one major flaw that kept us from wholeheartedly recommending it.\n\nSo, when we approached the idea of reviewing sleep headphones, we knew that\nwe\u2019d likely end up with several recommendations to address different\nsituations. We created an ambitious list of the most important features\nnecessary in a good pair of sleep headphones:\n\n  *  **They should be comfortable, no matter your sleep position.** Sleep headphones primarily come in three styles: wireless earbuds, earmuffs, and headbands with speaker drivers inside. Earmuffs are best suited for back-sleepers, headband options are best for folks who dislike the feeling of earbuds or earplugs in their ears, and earbuds generally block more external noise. Comfort also means no wires, as it\u2019s easy to become tangled in a headphone cable when you move in your sleep. We also kept an eye out for options that fit the needs of those who wear bonnets or headgear at night.\n  *  **They should fit a wide variety of head and ear sizes or offer a few sizes to choose from.** If a headband is too tight, it can cause headaches. If it\u2019s too loose, it will slip off. If your aim is to block noise, the earbuds must fit properly to seal off your ear canals.\n  *  **They should let you control what you listen to as you fall asleep.** What\u2019s relaxing to one person may be grating to another. Whether your jam is music, audiobooks, white noise, meditation, or ASMR (video), sleep headphones should let you access what you require.\n  *  **They should be reasonably easy to clean.** Earbuds require only an occasional wipe-down and sound-tube clearing. But for a fabric headband, you need to be able to wash it regularly. If the speakers and other electronics are challenging to remove and replace, or if the headband doesn\u2019t wash well, you won\u2019t be able to keep your sleep headphones in good condition.\n  *  **The battery life should be at least 10 hours.** The National Sleep Foundation recommends seven to nine hours each night, so we added an hour of listening time to allow for winding down before sleep. Though not everyone listens to audio all night, folks using headphones to block out disturbances or light sleepers who are using music or white noise to avoid being startled awake will need a full night\u2019s worth of battery power.\n  *  **They should be free of distracting beeps or bright lights.** Such things might disturb you during the night. If the device starts to beep to warn you the battery is low during the last hour of use, it\u2019s likely going to wake you.\n  *  **They should be affordable.** This point is especially important since many of the features that make a good pair of sleep headphones make them impractical to use during the day.\n  *  **They should sound reasonably good and have minimal latency.** Very piercing or muffled sound quality is just plain annoying when you\u2019re trying to unwind, and significant latency means dialogue won\u2019t match up with lip movements in video if, for instance, you watch Netflix to fall asleep.\n\nWith all of the above criteria in mind, we called in every brand-name set of\nsleep headphones we could find and a selection of affordable but lesser-known\noptions on Amazon. (And what we received proved to be quite interesting\u2014check\nout the Competition section for more details.)\n\nI tested each set for Bluetooth-connection reliability, fit, comfort, and\nsound quality. Wearing each pair, I tried lying in bed in various positions.\nTo note audio quality and to check for delays caused by Bluetooth-signal\nlatency, I listened to music and watched streaming video. For the headband-\nstyle models, I took the drivers and Bluetooth modules out of the headbands\nand put them back in again to gauge the difficulty of the process. And of\ncourse I tried sleeping in every pair.\n\nAs a final step, we sent the most palatable pairs to a Wirecutter staffer who\nhas tinnitus to gain feedback on how well they performed in that situation.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the sleep headphones we tested met all of our criteria.\nEach model had at least one major flaw that kept us from wholeheartedly\nrecommending it: The headphones were uncomfortable or didn\u2019t fit properly,\nwere overpriced, were difficult to reassemble after cleaning, or produced\ndistractions that might interfere with sleep\u2014or many of the above. So we\nshifted our focus to finding useful choices for people based on specific\nneeds, even if the choices were imperfect.\n\n## If you dislike wearing earplugs or earbuds: AcousticSheep SleepPhones\nWireless\n\nPhoto: Marki Williams\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### AcousticSheep SleepPhones Wireless\n\n## If you dislike wearing earplugs or earbuds\n\nThe headband-style SleepPhones come in different sizes and fabrics, and you\ncan stream any audio to them wirelessly via Bluetooth. But they cost more than\nmany similarly styled competitors.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$100 from Amazon\n\n$100 from SleepPhones\n\n **Who it\u2019s for:**AcousticSheep\u2019s SleepPhones Wireless sleep headphones are\nfor the person who enjoys drifting off to the sound of their favorite sleep\ntunes, ASMR videos, or meditations, and who doesn\u2019t want to disturb a partner\nor roommate. They\u2019re ideal for people who can\u2019t fall asleep in quiet rooms, as\nwell as for those who don\u2019t like the feeling of wearing earbuds while they\u2019re\ntrying to sleep.\n\n **Why we like it:** This headband-style pair of sleep headphones has the most\nflexible and comfortable speaker design of all the headphones we tested. No\nmatter how you lie on the SleepPhones, they won\u2019t dig into your ears like many\nother models we tried.\n\nAvailable in fluffy fleece or a lighter-weight, more breathable \u201cbreeze\u201d\nfabric, the SleepPhones can work as a headband or sit over the eyes. (Folks\nwho want total light blocking may prefer to use a separate sleep mask\ninstead.) The fabrics are stretchy, and the headbands are available in small,\nmedium, and large sizes\u2014so no matter the circumference of your noggin, you\nshould be able to find a fit that\u2019s snug enough to stay in place but not\nbrain-squeezing tight.\n\nThe electronics are removable, so you can easily machine-wash your headband or\nswap it out when it gets worn. We laundered our headband several times\nfollowing the instructions, and it washed up perfectly. You can buy additional\nheadbands separately for $20. The headbands feel better made than those of\ncheaper competitors, with thicker fabric, better stitching, and a Velcro\nclosure rather than a non-sealable opening.\n\nThe speakers are color-coded so that you can easily put them back into the\nheadband properly: The right speaker has red stitching, the left has green\nstitching, and the softer gray side of the speaker should face toward the ear.\nWith other sleep headphones we tested, we had to guess which way to put the\ndrivers back. Plus, AcousticSheep backs the SleepPhones with a one-year\nwarranty, whereas most of the lower-priced competitors don\u2019t even have a\ncompany website for you to contact someone if your headphones break.\n\nThe Bluetooth module in the SleepPhones has controls for volume, track skip,\nplay/pause, and power, but you have to use them by feel since the module\nresides under the fabric of the headband.

Photo: Marki Williams\n\nThe Bluetooth module provides raised controls for volume, track skip,\nplay/pause, and power. Although the module resides under the headband fabric,\nthe controls are relatively easy to use by feel. With my phone placed on the\nbedside table, I never had connection issues and could even walk a few rooms\naway to the bathroom with no problem.\n\nAcousticSheep claims that the battery life of the SleepPhones Wireless pair is\n24 hours for the latest version. (The older version was 12 hours, so make sure\nyou're buying the new one.) Our testing yielded over 24 hours of playtime, but\nthis can vary depending on your volume level and whether you play media all\nnight long or just as you fall asleep.\n\nA full charge from a dead battery takes around four hours, so if you want\naudio to play all night long, it\u2019s best to plug in your SleepPhones every few\ndays.\n\nThe speakers are thin, soft, flexible, and covered with felt, so they\u2019re\npleasant to lie on. The left and right speakers are indicated by colored\nstitching, and the front and back sides are gray and white, respectively\u2014a\nsmall detail that makes it much easier to put the electronics back in place\nafter washing the headband. Photo: Marki Williams\n\nOverall, the sound quality was quite good in our tests, with decent clarity on\nhigh notes and no harshness or other cheap-sounding aspects to the low and\nhigh frequencies. These headphones had more bass response than the cheaper\noptions we tried. The drivers actually played some low bass notes on hip-hop\ntracks, whereas the budget pairs reproduced only overtones. However, the\nSleepPhones are by no means bass-heavy and can\u2019t reproduce the deep booms in\nmovies (such as the resonant aspects of the infamous _Inception_\n\u201cbraaaaam\u201d)\u2014but given the headphones\u2019 intended use, at bedtime, we\u2019re willing\nto let this slide.\n\nWe found that all of our top models helped to mask tinnitus equally, provided\nthey fit well and offered enough sound options. Our tester who has tinnitus\nliked that they were able to use the same tracks with the SleepPhones that\nthey usually play through a small speaker.\n\n **Flaws that may be dealbreakers:** The fabric headband isn\u2019t as isolating as\nearbuds or the earcups on over-ear headphones, so sounds can get in and out.\nIf you\u2019re listening at max volume, someone in bed with you in a very quiet\nroom may hear a buzz or the tizzy outline of what you\u2019re listening to.\n\nYou can still hear some surrounding noise while wearing the SleepPhones, too,\nthough that ability may be a perk for people who are concerned about hearing a\nchild or pet, or someone who prefers auditory awareness for safety.\n\nThe headband design isn\u2019t ideal for everyone. People who wear hair bonnets to\nbed, who use nighttime skin treatments that can harm fabric, who wear certain\nCPAP masks or headgear at night, or who tend to feel hot when sleeping might\nfind that the thick headband just doesn\u2019t fit into their routine. People who\nshift about in their sleep may find that the headband eventually slips out of\nplace or falls off.\n\nBut the biggest drawback is that the SleepPhones design isn\u2019t one that\ntransitions well to daytime use, which may make it a lot harder to accept the\n$100 price tag. Although AcousticSheep says you can use the breeze-fabric\nheadband for working out, we\u2019d be hesitant to do so since the electronics\naren\u2019t rated for any moisture resistance, and sweat damage could void your\npair\u2019s warranty. Additionally, the SleepPhones lack a microphone, so if you\nwant to take a call, you need your phone.\n\n## If you want to block or mask loud noises: Anker Soundcore Sleep A10\n\nPhoto: Marki Williams\n\n#### Our pick\n\n### Anker Soundcore Sleep A10\n\n## If you need to block or mask sounds\n\nThese wireless earbuds physically block out noises and can play preloaded\nsounds or stream audio from your phone. They\u2019re smaller than other wireless\nearbuds, but people with sensitive ears may find that side-sleeping with them\nis uncomfortable.\n\n#### Buying Options\n\n$104 from Amazon\n\n$130 from Best Buy\n\n **Who it\u2019s for:** If you are desperate to block disruptive sounds so that you\ncan sleep, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10 earbuds can help. The earbuds\u2019\nisolating design blocks noise more effectively than headband-style sleep\nheadphones can. That isolation, in combination with played sounds, can muffle\nsnoring partners, boisterous barking dogs, or construction next door well\nenough for you to get some shut-eye. But people with sensitive ears and those\nwho sleep on firm pillows may find the earbud design to be uncomfortable.\n\n **Why we like it:** Some sleep-disrupting noises require more than just\nearplugs to ignore. Masking\u2014or playing a constant, lulling sound that is in\nthe same frequency range as the nuisance noise\u2014can help. The Sleep A10 pair is\ndesigned for that purpose.\n\nThe sealed ear tips are double-layered to block external noise much as\nearplugs do. The thin earbud design is more comfortable to lie on than that of\nstandard earbuds, and the included stability wings hold the earbuds in place\neven if you toss and turn. Simple tap-based controls reduce the risk of\naccidental playback changes, and the set can give you up to 10 hours\u2019 worth of\nconsistent sound.\n\nThe Sleep A10 earbuds can run for up to 10 hours, and the charging case holds\nup to seven additional charges. Photo: Marki Williams\n\nThe Sleep A10 set is not an active-noise-cancelling device. Active noise\ncancellation, while effective on sustained low-pitched sounds such as airplane\nnoise, isn\u2019t adept at reducing intermittent sounds like hammering or higher-\npitched sounds like voices.\n\nFor best results, you should listen to something with a pitch similar to that\nof the noise you\u2019re covering. The Soundcore app provides a library with dozens\nof different sounds that you can upload directly to the earbuds. One of our\ntesters with tinnitus found a track in the same frequency range as their\nringing, which helped make it less noticeable. The preloaded sound files loop\ninfinitely, so once your chosen track begins, you don\u2019t need to worry about\nanything interrupting your audio.\n\nIf the built-in sounds aren\u2019t for you, the A10 set also can stream your\nfavorite music/ASMR/meditation tracks via Bluetooth from your phone\u2014but this\nfunction reduces its battery life. Running preloaded sounds, the Sleep A10\nplayed for around 10 hours in our tests. If you stream music instead, you\u2019ll\nprobably get about six hours.\n\nAnother option is to start out streaming and transition to preloaded sounds\nwhen the A10 senses you\u2019ve fallen asleep\u2014doing this will provide you with\nsomewhere around eight hours of battery life. The battery in the case holds\nseven additional charges and can fully power up the earbuds in two hours.\n\nThese sleep earbuds come with four sizes of tips and three sizes of\nstabilizing wings to hold them securely in place while you sleep. Photo: Marki\nWilliams\n\nEach earbud is tiny (smaller than a Mentos mint) and far thinner than most\ntrue wireless earbuds that are made for daytime use. The pair comes with four\nsizes of tips and three sizes of stabilizing wings. However, the body of the\nearbuds is made of hard plastic, so people who don\u2019t like the feeling of\nearbuds in their ears or who sleep on firm pillows could still find the\npressure uncomfortable. To reduce thickness, the Sleep A10 set lacks\nmicrophones, so you must take the earbuds out to answer a call.\n\nThe Soundcore Sleep A10 can stream your playlist via Bluetooth, or you can\npreload it with masking sounds provided in the Soundcore app. Photo: Lauren\nDragan\n\nBecause this set blocks sound so well, you likely won\u2019t be able to hear an\nalarm clock. Fortunately, the earbuds offer their own alarm, which you can set\nvia the app. But when you put the earbuds back in the case to charge them, the\nalarm is automatically canceled\u2014so you have to reset it each time you take the\nearbuds out of the case.\n\nIf you happen to splash these earbuds with water, they\u2019ll survive, as they are\nwater resistant, with an IPX4 rating. Soundcore, which is owned by Anker,\ncovers the Sleep A10 with a two-year warranty and a 30-day money-back\nguarantee.\n\n **Flaws that may be dealbreakers:** Wearing the Sleep A10 earbuds isn\u2019t as\ncomfortable as wearing the softer AcousticSheep headband. Its effectiveness is\nmixed when it\u2019s amplifying the alarm on a phone. With a Google Pixel phone,\nfor example, our alarm tone played in the earbuds reliably, but at the same\nvolume as our listening material\u2014which may not be loud enough to wake heavy\nsleepers.\n\nThe tested performance on an iPhone was worse: The alarm played only from our\nphone, which definitely isn\u2019t sufficient to wake someone up. The Sleep A10 set\nhas a built-in alarm function that is effective but jarring\u2014it sounds like an\n\u201980s digital alarm clock that increases in volume, lacks a snooze button, and\ncan be stopped only when you place the earbuds back in the case.\n\nSo if you are accustomed to waking gently with a custom tone or hitting the\nsnooze button a few times, you\u2019ll be out of luck with the Sleep A10 pair. Even\na wake-up call may not be useful, as in our tests the same volume and playback\nissues occurred with ringtones. Hopefully, Soundcore can fix these issues with\na firmware update. But until then, you may want to have a backup option such\nas donning a haptic smartwatch or asking a loved one to make sure you\u2019re out\nof bed when you plan to be.\n\nAnother concern is that this pair\u2019s isolation and masking are so good that\npeople who need to be alerted to an emergency may not hear the alert. The\nSoundcore app has the option to turn off audio tracks after a certain amount\nof time, but if you have a snoring partner, this feature is less than ideal.\n\nAt the original price of $180, this pair is quite expensive for an earbuds set\nthat can\u2019t be used during the day. But there literally isn\u2019t any other model\navailable that does what the Sleep A10 pair does. Earplugs can reduce the\nsounds around you, but they also cause you to experience the occlusion effect,\nwhich amplifies every sound your body makes. And earplugs don\u2019t completely\ncover very loud sounds, such as from snoring or a jackhammer. We recognize\nthat some people may be desperate enough for some sleep that they\u2019re willing\nto do anything to find relief, and for them, the Soundcore Sleep A10 set is a\nreasonable option.\n\n## What to look forward to\n\nWe are testing the Snoozeband Deluxe and Snoozeband Pro, both of which are\neye-mask-style headbands with thin speakers embedded on the sides. The Deluxe\nmodel is $85, claims 12 hours of playtime, and has pockets for heat or cooling\npacks. The Pro model is $80, claims 15 hours of playtime, and has raised\neyecups to reduce pressure on the eyes.\n\nWe also plan to test the Bonamour Sleep System, a true-wireless-style earbud\npair that advertises itself as a successor to the now-discontinued Bose\nSleepbuds. The Bonamour set has a claimed eight-hour battery life, which is\nlower than we\u2019d like, but we are curious to try the included sound library and\nto see how comfortable the earbuds are. The System is $155 and boasts an\nimpressive five-year warranty.\n\n## The competition\n\nTesting for this guide reminded us why we generally don\u2019t test things from\nsmaller, unknown brands available on Amazon. Opening each set of budget sleep\nheadphones we purchased was a bizarre experience. Although the headbands\nmatched the photos displayed on Amazon, the brand names printed on the\nheadphones often didn\u2019t match what was on the box or what was on the purchase\nlisting. One pair didn\u2019t have any company information on the box, simply the\ngeneric term \u201cBluetooth Headband\u201d emblazoned on the package. This might not\nseem relevant\u2014except it means that you don\u2019t know who to contact if something\ngoes wrong.\n\nAlso, since we first published this guide in 2021, many of the budget sleep\nheadbands we tested have already disappeared from Amazon.\n\nOf the five top-reviewed budget options we ordered from Amazon, only one had\nheadband labeling and packaging that matched the company name on the purchase\nlisting. Also, there was no consistency in the size of the \u201cone size\u201d\nheadbands. Photo: Lauren Dragan\n\nAcousticSheep SleepPhones Effortless: This pair performs nearly identically to\nthe standard Wireless version but offers wireless charging capabilities.\nUnfortunately, the way you have to lay the SleepPhones Effortless on the\ncharging pod is awkward, so it\u2019s hard to know for certain that you\u2019ve aligned\nit correctly, and the battery life is 10 hours versus the 12 hours of the\nnewest Wireless edition. As a result, we don\u2019t recommend paying the extra\nmoney for this feature.\n\nEverPlus Sleep Headphones: This budget pair had a small headband that we\nthought might squeeze larger heads. The speakers were foam-covered pucks that\nwere too hard and uncomfortable to lie on all night, and a bright light\nblinked annoyingly. The headphones lacked bass notes, too. Worth considering:\nNo brand name appeared on the packaging, and the name \u201cEnjoying\u201d was\nembroidered on the label, so we aren\u2019t sure that there is any customer service\nto contact should you have issues.\n\nHoomBand: This headband-style set is similar in design to the SleepPhones and\ngenerally costs a little less. Overall, this is one of the better options we\ntested, but there are a few aspects to consider. The sound quality has\nslightly less detail compared to the SleepPhones but far better clarity than\nthe budget options we tested. Battery life is only 10 hours, and the Bluetooth\nmodule is a chunky, cuboid rectangle with only play/pause capabilities.\nHoomBand thoughtfully cushioned the module (and speakers) with a foam lining,\nbut back-sleepers with firm pillows may still feel the lump.\n\nThe headband\u2019s foam is surprisingly breathable, but it holds in heat more than\nthe AcousticSheep headbands. The HoomBand headband is stretchy and hand-\nwashable, but the fabric is rather wide\u2014about an inch wider than that of the\nSleepPhones. This broad design is comfortable but may not appeal to folks who\nwear sleep masks.\n\nThe HoomBand also offers you less choice in material and sizes; currently the\nheadbands are available in only one color and two sizes, and HoomBand\nreplacement/additional headbands are not yet available for sale. So if you\nwant to have one headband in use while another is the wash, you\u2019ll want to\nlook at the SleepPhones instead. Although the foam adds structure and\ncushioning, getting it in and out of the headband is a little tricky.\n\nIncluded with the headband purchase is access to HoomBand\u2019s HoomPlay app,\nwhich currently offers around 50 pieces of sleep content ranging from bedtime\nstories to sound baths. For someone without an existing playlist, the app\u2019s\nofferings (which HoomBand says is updated regularly) are a nice perk. The\ntracks range from 25 to 60 minutes and can be looped to play all night. That\nisn\u2019t to say you are stuck with their content: Should you choose not to use\nthe app, HoomBand headphones also stream other audio via Bluetooth.\n\nKokoon Nightbuds: This pair of sleep earbuds is packed with features,\nincluding sleep tracking, built-in white noise and meditations, and automatic\nmusic fade-out when the sensors detect you\u2019re asleep. This pair also streams\nmusic via Bluetooth and has a sealed-earbud design to help block external\nnoises. The silicone tips have stability wings attached to hold the earbuds\nsecurely in place as you move at night.\n\nThe downside is comfort. This pair isn\u2019t ideal for back-sleepers, as the\nBluetooth and volume-control module rests behind your head and connects to the\nearbuds via a wavy cable. You can lie on it, but it may affect streaming\nconnectivity, and people with sensitive noggins (or who wear their hair back\nor in caps) might find the module (which is the size of a curved Pepperidge\nFarm Milano cookie) annoying.\n\nThe cable also is problematic, as the Nightbuds ship with a clear warning to\nnot stretch the cable\u2014which could easily happen if you snag it in your sleep.\nFor side- and tummy-sleepers, the part of the cable that attaches to the\nearbuds smashes into the ear all night, and can become irritating.\n\nKokoon Relax Second Edition: We appreciated the variety of sound and\nmeditations in the included app. However, the overall experience of this over-\near pair was lacking. Despite its use of flat, very padded earcups, the Kokoon\nover-ear design isn\u2019t made for side- or stomach-sleepers. Kokoon recommends\nbuying a \u201cvery deep pillow\u201d to accommodate these headphones, which we weren\u2019t\nparticularly jazzed about paying for in addition to the $350 headphone price.\n\nThe earcups are lined with metal electrode nubbins that are meant to track\nyour brain activity and monitor your sleep quality. After an hour of use,\nthese nubbins left indentations on our testers\u2019 ears and caused them to ache.\nThey also didn\u2019t work\u2014as we sat taking notes, the app registered us as being\nin a deep sleep. Kokoon says it is aware of the issue and that it will fix the\nproblem in the app soon, but we were disappointed to find that the main\nfeature setting this pair apart didn\u2019t even function properly.\n\nManta Sleep Mask Sound: This eye mask/headphone combo is based on a design we\ndiscuss in our guide to sleep masks. In that guide, we describe Manta\u2019s mask\nas good \u201c[if] you know you want to wear a sleep mask only when you\u2019re sitting\nup, and if you have trouble getting traditional sleep masks to fit.\u201d If you\u2019re\nlooking for comfort when lying down, this model isn\u2019t for you. Additionally,\nif you plan to sleep on a plane, we recommend headphones that have active\nnoise cancellation so that you don\u2019t need to listen at unsafe levels to drown\nout engine noise.\n\nMusicozy Sleep Headphones: Though the packaging said \u201cMusicozy,\u201d the headband\nwas labeled \u201cEnjoying.\u201d The internal parts were also similar to those of the\nEverPlus headphones, with uncomfortable drivers, a lack of bass, and a\nblinking light. The headband was on the snug side for us; folks with larger\nheads may not like the fit.\n\nToPoint Sleep Headphones: This pair, though sold by ToPoint, contained\nheadphones and packaging that said \u201cMusicozy.\u201d And as with the other budget\noptions we saw, which all seemed to be made with similar electronic parts, the\nspeakers were uncomfortable to lie on for long periods, the headband had the\nannoying blinking light, and the low bass was lacking. This pair also beeped\nvery loudly when the battery was low. The headband was one of the smaller\nmodels we tested; it would fit smaller noggins better than larger ones.\n\n _This article was edited by Adrienne Maxwell and Grant Clauser.  _\n\n## Meet your guide\n\nLauren Dragan\n\nLauren Dragan is a senior staff writer and has tested nearly 2,000 headphones\nfor Wirecutter.
