They are also wireless and feature induction charging, making them the most intuitive and easy to live with. It's the absolute best of all the models I have ever tried and something that completely transformed my sleep patterns. They are a headband design that is a highly comfortable way to sleep as it is less prone to coming dislodged when rolling about in your sleep. Traditional headphone slips off, and earbuds can be pulled out. With the Sleepphones, I found, more often than not, when I woke up in the morning, they were still on my head the way I had left them the night before. Another essential feature is the Sleepphones use extremely thin speaker diaphragms that are flexible and don't cause discomfort when side sleeping. The materials used allow them to be flexible, so they conform with your ears, and the whole thing is covered with generous padding to enhance comfort further. Finally, the essential feature of the Sleepphones is wireless. No longer will you be tethered in your sleep. If you wake up and need to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water, you don\u2019t have to go through the routine of disconnecting your phone or music player and resetting everything when you return. It\u2019s remarkably freeing and the one reason I recommend this model over all others. Battery life is a fantastic 12 hours; they can be recharged in just 2 hours.",

It\u2019s hard to explain and something you need to get in hand to understand just how small the SZHTFX is. They are ergonomically one of the most comfortable sets on our test and cause no discomfort when side sleeping. Despite the small size, you still get Bluetooth 5.3 for better efficiency and connection. Built-in touch controls and 4 hours of battery life will help you get to sleep. They won\u2019t last the whole night, but if you are looking for something for those first few hours and don\u2019t like sleeping with cables or using bulky headbands, this could be perfect. As a side, not they also work great as day-to-day earphones.",

Traditionally, I would advocate sleeping with earphones because when you roll to your side, they push more profoundly into your ear canal and cause discomfort. The Maxrock, though, is so small and unobtrusive that I can comfortably sleep with them all night, yet at the same time, if you lose them in the dark, good luck finding them.",

Many people will like this because it saves the fumble in the dark for two items instead of just one. I was initially skeptical, but they have held up well, cost less than 20 dollars, and go for 9 hours on a single charge. However, there is a noticeable difference in the quality and design between these and the Sleepphones we listed as number 1. They are a little less robust and have much thicker speakers, which can lead to a bit of discomfort with hard pillows.",

I was impressed with the new Sound + Sleep, so I thought it was worthy of inclusion on this list. Headphones might not work for you, but plenty of options remain to get a good night\u2019s rest. During my battles with lifelong insomnia, I have tried numerous white noise machines, but none have been as intuitive and versatile as Sound Sleep. After a few days of use, you will know the button layout well enough to use it in the dark, and despite having many options, it\u2019s very intuitive. This unit is a noise machine with multiple settings and realistic sounds that can be easily adjusted through the panel controls. There are ten sounds, but you can modify them by adjusting the ambient and richness settings. The only negative is that the large twist dial isn\u2019t for adjusting volume but for selecting the sound you wish to use to help you sleep. For me, volume adjustment here would have been better. It is the best speaker of this kind I have tried, and it stops me from using my phone in bed.",
