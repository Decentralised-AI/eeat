Unfortunately, having my bedtime stories playing on speaker can cause\nproblems: My partner prefers the quiet. Plus, I travel often and share rooms\nwith friends, so my much-needed background noise can be bothersome to others.\nEarlier this year, after sharing a studio flat with a friend on a trip abroad\nand getting only a couple of fitful hours of sleep each night, I decided I had\nto find a solution that would allow me to sleep without forcing my friends or\npartner to listen to Rosamund Pike read _Pride and Prejudice_ for the 22nd\ntime (though it would be their loss). I first saw the headband several years\nago when it came up in an exhaustive Amazon search for total blackout sleeping\nmasks. At the time, its goofiness was too much of a turnoff, but the headband\nstayed in the back of my mind until I caved and ordered it earlier this year.\nNow, I haven\u2019t slept a night without one in the past three months.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept: The headband has a small, flat speaker installed in a\nlittle pocket on each side, and you can manipulate the placement of the\nspeakers with your fingers so they fit just so against your ears. I sleep in\nthe headband all night, and it stays put until morning, even when I toss and\nturn. It\u2019s genuinely comfortable to wear: The soft, stretchy material hasn\u2019t\nirritated my sensitive skin at all, which is never a given for me. The flat\nspeakers inside mean that nothing is jamming against my ear or poking me in\nthe night. The little pockets where the speakers are sewn in are pretty snug,\nso the speakers don\u2019t slip around inside \u2014 I\u2019ve only had to adjust them a\ncouple of times in the past few months.\n\nLC-dolida Sleep Headphones\n\n$20\n\n$20\n\n$20  at Amazon\n\nBuy\n\n$20  at Amazon\n\nBuy\n\nAs regards to the sound quality, for the purpose of sleeping, it\u2019s great. The\naudio comes through clear \u2014 no tinny static or flattened sound, and the range\nof volume is decent. The battery life is also pretty good \u2014 I can use it for\ntwo or three full nights between charges, and it powers back up fast \u2014 it\u2019s\nusually close to full again within two hours of charging. However, I will say\nthat if you\u2019re looking for noise-canceling headphones, these aren\u2019t it. I\nrecently took a long-haul flight and definitely wished I\u2019d packed something a\nlittle more heavy-duty than this headband to dull the engine noise and plane\nchatter (but I still used them every night of the trip while sharing a room\nwith my sister, so no regrets).\n\nI suppose I should address the fact that I look kind of goofy wearing it. ****\nThe control panel on top is a bit cumbersome and blocky (despite not including\na pause button), and the whole thing is a little wider than a typical\nheadband. But while I wouldn\u2019t make it a staple accessory while out and about,\nwearing it on a dog walk, to the gym, or at the airport doesn\u2019t bother me at\nall. And now that I own it, the headband follows me around. My mom was\nrecently gifted one by a friend who has her own, to help her sleep on an\nupcoming cruise where she\u2019s sharing a room. Here\u2019s hoping it helps her sleep\nas soundly as I do.\n\n## get the strategist newsletter\n\nActually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.\n\nEmail\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to\nreceive email correspondence from us.\n\n_The Strategist_ _is designed to surface the most useful, expert\nrecommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

Unfortunately, having my bedtime stories playing on speaker can cause\nproblems: My partner prefers the quiet. Plus, I travel often and share rooms\nwith friends, so my much-needed background noise can be bothersome to others.\nEarlier this year, after sharing a studio flat with a friend on a trip abroad\nand getting only a couple of fitful hours of sleep each night, I decided I had\nto find a solution that would allow me to sleep without forcing my friends or\npartner to listen to Rosamund Pike read _Pride and Prejudice_ for the 22nd\ntime (though it would be their loss). I first saw the headband several years\nago when it came up in an exhaustive Amazon search for total blackout sleeping\nmasks. At the time, its goofiness was too much of a turnoff, but the headband\nstayed in the back of my mind until I caved and ordered it earlier this year.\nNow, I haven\u2019t slept a night without one in the past three months.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept: The headband has a small, flat speaker installed in a\nlittle pocket on each side, and you can manipulate the placement of the\nspeakers with your fingers so they fit just so against your ears. I sleep in\nthe headband all night, and it stays put until morning, even when I toss and\nturn. It\u2019s genuinely comfortable to wear: The soft, stretchy material hasn\u2019t\nirritated my sensitive skin at all, which is never a given for me. The flat\nspeakers inside mean that nothing is jamming against my ear or poking me in\nthe night. The little pockets where the speakers are sewn in are pretty snug,\nso the speakers don\u2019t slip around inside \u2014 I\u2019ve only had to adjust them a\ncouple of times in the past few months.\n\nLC-dolida Sleep Headphones\n\n$20\n\n$20\n\n$20  at Amazon\n\nBuy\n\n$20  at Amazon\n\nBuy\n\nAs regards to the sound quality, for the purpose of sleeping, it\u2019s great. The\naudio comes through clear \u2014 no tinny static or flattened sound, and the range\nof volume is decent. The battery life is also pretty good \u2014 I can use it for\ntwo or three full nights between charges, and it powers back up fast \u2014 it\u2019s\nusually close to full again within two hours of charging. However, I will say\nthat if you\u2019re looking for noise-canceling headphones, these aren\u2019t it. I\nrecently took a long-haul flight and definitely wished I\u2019d packed something a\nlittle more heavy-duty than this headband to dull the engine noise and plane\nchatter (but I still used them every night of the trip while sharing a room\nwith my sister, so no regrets).\n\nI suppose I should address the fact that I look kind of goofy wearing it. ****\nThe control panel on top is a bit cumbersome and blocky (despite not including\na pause button), and the whole thing is a little wider than a typical\nheadband. But while I wouldn\u2019t make it a staple accessory while out and about,\nwearing it on a dog walk, to the gym, or at the airport doesn\u2019t bother me at\nall. And now that I own it, the headband follows me around. My mom was\nrecently gifted one by a friend who has her own, to help her sleep on an\nupcoming cruise where she\u2019s sharing a room. Here\u2019s hoping it helps her sleep\nas soundly as I do.\n\n## get the strategist newsletter\n\nActually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.\n\nEmail\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to\nreceive email correspondence from us.\n\n_The Strategist_ _is designed to surface the most useful, expert\nrecommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
