This\ncontent is created independently from TIME\u2019s editorial staff. Learn more.\n\nby Nick Leftley\n\nUpdated December 10, 2023\n\nWe all have different bedtime routines. Some people need total silence,\nblackout curtains, and complete motionlessness to be able to fall asleep.\nOthers require the TV on, music playing, nightlights glowing\u2014and at least\nthree fans blowing. If you\u2019re the type who needs soothing sounds, but don\u2019t\nwant to irritate partners or roommates, take a look at our picks for the best\nheadphones for sleeping, and see if there\u2019s something here that works for you.\nRemember, if you snooze, you actually win.\n\n## Our top picks for the best headphones for sleeping\n\n### The best noise canceling headphones for sleeping: Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless\nNoise Canceling Headphones\n\n\u201cThe Sony WH-1000XM4 offers excellent noise cancellation and comfort for\nsleep,\u201d says Hafiz Shariff, sleep expert and founder of luxury bedding brand\nOwl + Lark. While you\u2019d obviously have to be a back sleeper for these to work\nfor you, their touch sensor controls, 30 hours of battery life, and adaptive\nsound control make these a great option for those who don\u2019t roll around too\nmuch at night. \u201cThese have exceptional comfort, good noise canceling, and\nwireless convenience for relaxed sleep,\u201d agrees Dr. Shelby Harris, licensed\nclinical psychologist and board certified sleep specialist.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless\n  * Battery Life: 30 hours\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $349.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Active noise cancelation\n  * Five hours of battery on a ten-minute charge\n  * Hands-free calling\n  * Automatically pauses playback when you take them off\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Large\n  * Can\u2019t be used while charging\n  * Expensive\n\nBest noise canceling\n\n### Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones with\nGoogle Assistant - Black\n\nWalmart\n\n$348.00$283.00\n\namazon\n\n$348.00\n\n### The best wireless earbuds for sleeping: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\nIf you\u2019re unlikely to drop off with a big pair of cans on your head, some\nwireless earbuds might be a better option. \u201cApple AirPods Pro provide a\ncomfortable fit, wireless convenience, and decent noise isolation, to\ncontribute to a good sleep experience,\u201d says Harris. Shariff concurs, praising\ntheir noise isolation, and secure fit. You\u2019re also less likely to lose their\nlittle charging case with this generation, since its built-in speaker will\nmake noises to help you track it down.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless earbuds\n  * Battery Life: Six hours\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes\n  * Return Policy: Within 14 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $249\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Touch controls\n  * Four sizes of silicone tip included, for perfect fit\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Only six hours of battery life when using active noise cancelation \n\nBest wireless earbuds\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\nbuy on Appleamazon\n\n$259.00\n\n### The best wired earbuds for sleeping: Moondrop Chu\n\nWhile soothing sounds can help lull you to sleep, the price tag on many\nheadphone options will certainly wake you up with a jolt. That\u2019s why these $20\nwired earbuds are such a pleasant surprise, offering sound quality comparable\nto many of their much higher-end competitors. When it\u2019s time to go to sleep,\nthe included silicone ear hooks make sure they stay comfortably in place, even\nwhen you\u2019re doing your most intense sleep-headbanging.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wired earbuds\n  * Battery Life: N/A\n  * Noise Canceling: No\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days, if bought through Amazon\n  * Warranty: Not listed\n  * Price on Publish: $19.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Extremely inexpensive\n  * Amazing sound quality for the price\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * A minority of customer reviews complain that they don\u2019t last as long as they would have liked\n  * No noise cancelation\n\nBest wired earbuds\n\n### Moondrop CHU High Performance Dynamic Driver IEMs in-Ear Earphone (Without\nmic)\n\namazon\n\n$19.99\n\n### The best headphones for sleeping for side sleepers: SleepPhones Wireless\n\nIf you sleep on your side (or perhaps more accurately, on your side, but also\nin multiple other positions as you roll around during the night), even earbuds\nmight have a hard time staying put. This soft headband option could be what\nyou\u2019re looking for. \u201cSleepPhones Wireless are designed specifically for sleep\nand have a headband-style design,\u201d says Shariff. \u201cWith their flat speakers,\nthey\u2019re well-suited for side sleepers.\u201d Harris agrees, noting their softness,\ncomfort, and convenience for side sleepers.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless headband\n  * Battery Life: 24 hours\n  * Noise Canceling: No\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $99.95\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Comfortable\n  * Good for all types of sleepers\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * No noise cancelation\n\nBest for side sleepers\n\n### SleepPhones Wireless\n\nsleepphones\n\n$99.95\n\namazon\n\n$99.95\n\n### The best over-ear headphones for sleeping: CozyPhones Sleep Headphones\n\nAnother good option for those who want to sleep without a big, bulky set of\nheadphones, or something sticking into their ear, this headband features\nultra-thin, adjustable-position speakers that nestle gently over your ears.\n\u201cThey have a soft headband design, flat speakers, and a comfortable fit for a\npeaceful sleep,\u201d enthuses Harris, while Shariff also notes how comfy they are.\nSince the headband is made of breathable, cooling fabric, these could also be\na convenient set of headphones for working out.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wired headband\n  * Battery Life: N/A\n  * Noise Canceling: No\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days, if bought through Amazon\n  * Warranty: Not listed\n  * Price on Publish: $19.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Extremely inexpensive\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Wired, so you\u2019ll have to secure the wire (so it doesn\u2019t wrap around you) before sleeping\n\nBest over-ear headphones\n\n### CozyPhones Sleep Headphones - Over Ear Headphones from Ultra Thin Cool\nMesh Wired for Side Sleepers, Meditation, Running, Laptop, and Phone - Black\n\namazon\n\n$19.99$16.99\n\n### The best headphones for sleeping with sleep tracking features: Kokoon\nNightbuds\n\nIf you have trouble either falling or staying asleep, you might well want to\nmonitor your sleep throughout the night to figure out what\u2019s going on.\nKokoon\u2019s nightbuds\u2014recommended by both Harris and Shariff\u2014pair with an app\nthat tracks your slumber throughout the night. The biometric app monitors your\nheart rate, and gives you a daily summary of your sleep, including how long\nyou slept and how well. The app even knows when you\u2019ve fallen asleep, gently\nfading out your chosen audio and turning it off.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless sleep tracking headphones\n  * Battery Life: 10 hours\n  * Noise Canceling: No\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days\n  * Warranty: Not listed\n  * Price on Publish: $249.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Innovative\n  * App also offers selection of sleep-friendly audio, including meditations and binaural soundscapes\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Some customer reviews complain that the silicon buds pop off too easily\n\nBest with sleep tracking features\n\n### Kokoon Nightbuds\n\nkokoon\n\n$249.99\n\nbuy on amazon\n\n### The best budget headphones for sleeping: MAXROCK Sleep Earplugs\n\nFor a set of earbuds coming in under $12, the reviews on these are shockingly\ngood, with 78% of Amazon reviews being in the four- or five-star category.\nHarris and Shariff also recommend them, citing their soft earbuds and dual\npurpose design (since you can use them as either headphones or earplugs). They\neven come with a zippered case to keep them in, which again, is incredible\nconsidering the price.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wired earbuds\n  * Battery Life: N/A\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes (but see \u201cwhat we don\u2019t like\u201d section below)\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days, if bought through Amazon\n  * Warranty: 3 months\n  * Price on Publish: $11.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Extremely inexpensive\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Although advertised as noise canceling, multiple customer reviews state that they\u2019re not truly noise canceling, with some saying they block out a third of outside sound at best\n\nBest budget\n\n### MAXROCK Sleep Earplugs - Noise Isolating Ear Plugs Sleep Earbuds\nHeadphones with Unique Total Soft Silicone Perfect for Insomnia, Side Sleeper,\nSnoring, Air Travel, Meditation & Relaxation (acid blue)\n\namazon\n\n$13.99\n\n### The best high-end headphones for sleeping: Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\nIf you\u2019re obsessed with audio quality, even while fast asleep, then Bose\nQuietComfort is probably the one for you. With world class noise cancelation,\ntouch controls, a built-in microphone, Bluetooth 5.3 compatibility, and\ncomfortable earbuds with three size options included, it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re\ngetting a lot here, even if the price tag is admittedly hefty for earbuds.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless earbuds\n  * Battery Life: 6 hours\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes\n  * Return Policy: Within 90 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $299\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Excellent sound quality\n  * Moisture resistant\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Expensive\n  * A minority of customer reviews note that they had issues with pairing\n\nBest high-end\n\n### Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\nbose\n\n$199.00\n\namazon\n\n$279.00\n\n## What you should know about the best headphones for sleeping\n\n\u201cThis depends on what you want to use the headphones (or earbuds) for,\u201d says\naudiologist Dr. Clifford Olson. \u201cYou could be looking for relaxation, comfort,\nnoise blocking, or tinnitus masking. If relaxation is the goal, you should\nfind headphones that allow you to pick the types of sounds that you want to\nlisten to, often by having bluetooth to connect to a smart device so you can\ncontrol your media. If comfort is the key, you will want to ensure the\nheadphones have soft cushions, breath well, and are not too large. For these\nreasons, you may also want to consider using sleep earbuds instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf noise blocking is your priority, it\u2019s a good idea to identify headphones\nor earbuds that have active noise cancellation, that will actually identify\nand cancel outside sounds like traffic noise, noisy neighbors or snoring,\u201d\nOlson continues. \u201cIf masking tinnitus is the priority, you will want\nheadphones that have the capability of playing tinnitus masking sound instead\nof just blocking external noises, which will typically make the perception of\ntinnitus louder.\u201d\n\n\u201cComfort is paramount here,\u201d adds Shariff. \u201cYour headphones shouldn\u2019t cause\ndiscomfort or pressure points while lying down. I recommend looking for\nheadphones with a low-profile design and soft padding. Wireless options are a\ngreat choice to prevent tangling and allow for movement during sleep. While\nsound quality should definitely be clear, it's important to prioritize comfort\nover audiophile-grade sound in this context.\u201d\n\n## How we selected the best headphones for sleeping\n\nWe made our selections through a combination of expert advice, thorough\nresearch, and ensuring all our picks had overwhelmingly positive customer\nreviews.\n\n## Alternatives to headphones for sleeping\n\n\u201cWhite noise machines can create a soothing background sound that masks\ndisturbances, and earplugs can also be effective in reducing any surrounding\nnoise,\u201d says Shariff. \u201cThere\u2019s also sleep masks with built-in speakers that\ncan deliver audio without any pressure on the ears at all\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply running a fan, wearing foam earplugs, or using a sound generator that\ncan play a variety of different masking noises, including white noise, can\nalso help to relax, distract from other external sounds, and mask tinnitus,\u201d\nsuggests Olson.\n\n\u201cAromatherapy with calming scents such as lavender, and using blackout\ncurtains for a dark sleep space can help, too,\u201d adds Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a\nboard-certified sleep and internal medicine doctor. \u201cRelaxation techniques\nsuch as deep breathing, meditation, and muscle relaxation are effective, as\nwell.\u201d\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n### Are sleep headphones comfortable for sleeping?\n\n\u201cSleep headphones usually feature slim profiles, padded headbands, and soft\near cushions to prevent discomfort while lying on your side,\u201d says Shariff.\n\u201cHowever, as individual preferences vary, you should shop around for\nheadphones with adjustable features to find the most comfortable fit for you.\nEveryone has their own preference when it comes to comfortable sleep, and\nknowing this can help you make the most informed purchasing choice for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally, using headphones for sleeping is only good for individuals who\nsleep on their back,\u201d says Olson. \u201cIf you\u2019re a side sleeper or a stomach\nsleeper, they\u2019re generally not a good idea. In addition, they tend to get hot\nwhile wearing, which can make it harder to fall asleep and even wake you up in\nthe middle of the night.\u201d\n\n### What is the difference between noise isolation and noise-canceling sleep\nheadphones?\n\n\u201cNoise isolation headphones will physically block out external noise by\ncreating a seal around your ears, while noise-canceling headphones reduce\nambient noise by generating sound waves that cancel out unwanted sounds,\u201d\nexplains Shariff. \u201cFor sleeping, noise isolation can usually be enough, as\nit's less complex and tends to be more comfortable for extended wear.\u201d\n\n### Are wireless sleep headphones better than wired options?\n\n\u201cWireless headphones are great for sleeping because the wires don\u2019t get in the\nway of your movements, like rolling over, which may even cause the wires to\ncome unplugged from your headphones or the device they\u2019re plugged into,\u201d says\nOlson. \u201cHowever, wireless headphones can also run out of battery and have the\npossibility of losing connection with your streaming device.\u201d\n\n### Are there any potential health risks associated with wearing headphones\nduring sleep?\n\n\u201cWhile sleep headphones are generally safe, there are potential health risks\nto consider,\u201d warns Shariff. \u201cWearing headphones that are too tight or have a\nhard headband could lead to discomfort or headaches, and listening to music at\nhigh volumes during sleep could impact your hearing over time. To mitigate\nrisks, I recommend choosing headphones with a comfortable fit and use a volume\nlevel that allows you to hear your surroundings. Whilst you can choose to\nsleep with earbuds in, and there are products designed for just this, users\nshould be aware of bacteria build up from having these in overnight, and as\nsuch may want to factor this into their purchasing decision if the possibility\nof infection is a concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf sound is played at too high of a level, then permanent hearing damage can\noccur,\u201d reiterates Olson. \u201cThis is incredibly risky if the device that you\u2019re\nconnected to doesn't warn you about the decibel level. You also have to\nconsider safety concerns, such as sleeping with consumer electronics that use\na lithium battery, as well as concerns of not being able to hear alarms such\nas smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and possible home intruders.\u201d\n\nThe information presented here is created independently from the TIME\neditorial staff.

Some people need total silence,\nblackout curtains, and complete motionlessness to be able to fall asleep.\nOthers require the TV on, music playing, nightlights glowing\u2014and at least\nthree fans blowing. If you\u2019re the type who needs soothing sounds, but don\u2019t\nwant to irritate partners or roommates, take a look at our picks for the best\nheadphones for sleeping, and see if there\u2019s something here that works for you.\nRemember, if you snooze, you actually win.\n\n## Our top picks for the best headphones for sleeping\n\n### The best noise canceling headphones for sleeping: Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless\nNoise Canceling Headphones\n\n\u201cThe Sony WH-1000XM4 offers excellent noise cancellation and comfort for\nsleep,\u201d says Hafiz Shariff, sleep expert and founder of luxury bedding brand\nOwl + Lark. While you\u2019d obviously have to be a back sleeper for these to work\nfor you, their touch sensor controls, 30 hours of battery life, and adaptive\nsound control make these a great option for those who don\u2019t roll around too\nmuch at night. \u201cThese have exceptional comfort, good noise canceling, and\nwireless convenience for relaxed sleep,\u201d agrees Dr. Shelby Harris, licensed\nclinical psychologist and board certified sleep specialist.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless\n  * Battery Life: 30 hours\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes\n  * Return Policy: Within 30 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $349.99\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Active noise cancelation\n  * Five hours of battery on a ten-minute charge\n  * Hands-free calling\n  * Automatically pauses playback when you take them off\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Large\n  * Can\u2019t be used while charging\n  * Expensive\n\nBest noise canceling\n\n### Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones with\nGoogle Assistant - Black\n\nWalmart\n\n$348.00$283.00\n\namazon\n\n$348.00\n\n### The best wireless earbuds for sleeping: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\nIf you\u2019re unlikely to drop off with a big pair of cans on your head, some\nwireless earbuds might be a better option. \u201cApple AirPods Pro provide a\ncomfortable fit, wireless convenience, and decent noise isolation, to\ncontribute to a good sleep experience,\u201d says Harris. Shariff concurs, praising\ntheir noise isolation, and secure fit. You\u2019re also less likely to lose their\nlittle charging case with this generation, since its built-in speaker will\nmake noises to help you track it down.\n\n#### Specifications:\n\n  * Headphone Type: Wireless earbuds\n  * Battery Life: Six hours\n  * Noise Canceling: Yes\n  * Return Policy: Within 14 days\n  * Warranty: 1 year\n  * Price on Publish: $249\n\n#### What we like:\n\n  * Touch controls\n  * Four sizes of silicone tip included, for perfect fit\n\n#### What we don\u2019t like:\n\n  * Only six hours of battery life when using active noise cancelation \n\nBest wireless earbuds\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\nbuy on Appleamazon\n\n$259.00\n\n### The best wired earbuds for sleeping: Moondrop Chu\n\nWhile soothing sounds can help lull you to sleep, the price tag on many\nheadphone options will certainly wake you up with a jolt.

If relaxation is the goal, you should\nfind headphones that allow you to pick the types of sounds that you want to\nlisten to, often by having bluetooth to connect to a smart device so you can\ncontrol your media. If comfort is the key, you will want to ensure the\nheadphones have soft cushions, breath well, and are not too large. For these\nreasons, you may also want to consider using sleep earbuds instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf noise blocking is your priority, it\u2019s a good idea to identify headphones\nor earbuds that have active noise cancellation, that will actually identify\nand cancel outside sounds like traffic noise, noisy neighbors or snoring,\u201d\nOlson continues. \u201cIf masking tinnitus is the priority, you will want\nheadphones that have the capability of playing tinnitus masking sound instead\nof just blocking external noises, which will typically make the perception of\ntinnitus louder.\u201d\n\n\u201cComfort is paramount here,\u201d adds Shariff. \u201cYour headphones shouldn\u2019t cause\ndiscomfort or pressure points while lying down. I recommend looking for\nheadphones with a low-profile design and soft padding. Wireless options are a\ngreat choice to prevent tangling and allow for movement during sleep. While\nsound quality should definitely be clear, it's important to prioritize comfort\nover audiophile-grade sound in this context.\u201d\n\n## How we selected the best headphones for sleeping\n\nWe made our selections through a combination of expert advice, thorough\nresearch, and ensuring all our picks had overwhelmingly positive customer\nreviews.\n\n## Alternatives to headphones for sleeping\n\n\u201cWhite noise machines can create a soothing background sound that masks\ndisturbances, and earplugs can also be effective in reducing any surrounding\nnoise,\u201d says Shariff. \u201cThere\u2019s also sleep masks with built-in speakers that\ncan deliver audio without any pressure on the ears at all\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply running a fan, wearing foam earplugs, or using a sound generator that\ncan play a variety of different masking noises, including white noise, can\nalso help to relax, distract from other external sounds, and mask tinnitus,\u201d\nsuggests Olson.\n\n\u201cAromatherapy with calming scents such as lavender, and using blackout\ncurtains for a dark sleep space can help, too,\u201d adds Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a\nboard-certified sleep and internal medicine doctor. \u201cRelaxation techniques\nsuch as deep breathing, meditation, and muscle relaxation are effective, as\nwell.\u201d\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n### Are sleep headphones comfortable for sleeping?\n\n\u201cSleep headphones usually feature slim profiles, padded headbands, and soft\near cushions to prevent discomfort while lying on your side,\u201d says Shariff.\n\u201cHowever, as individual preferences vary, you should shop around for\nheadphones with adjustable features to find the most comfortable fit for you.\nEveryone has their own preference when it comes to comfortable sleep, and\nknowing this can help you make the most informed purchasing choice for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally, using headphones for sleeping is only good for individuals who\nsleep on their back,\u201d says Olson. \u201cIf you\u2019re a side sleeper or a stomach\nsleeper, they\u2019re generally not a good idea. In addition, they tend to get hot\nwhile wearing, which can make it harder to fall asleep and even wake you up in\nthe middle of the night.\u201d\n\n### What is the difference between noise isolation and noise-canceling sleep\nheadphones?\n\n\u201cNoise isolation headphones will physically block out external noise by\ncreating a seal around your ears, while noise-canceling headphones reduce\nambient noise by generating sound waves that cancel out unwanted sounds,\u201d\nexplains Shariff. \u201cFor sleeping, noise isolation can usually be enough, as\nit's less complex and tends to be more comfortable for extended wear.\u201d\n\n### Are wireless sleep headphones better than wired options?\n\n\u201cWireless headphones are great for sleeping because the wires don\u2019t get in the\nway of your movements, like rolling over, which may even cause the wires to\ncome unplugged from your headphones or the device they\u2019re plugged into,\u201d says\nOlson. \u201cHowever, wireless headphones can also run out of battery and have the\npossibility of losing connection with your streaming device.\u201d\n\n### Are there any potential health risks associated with wearing headphones\nduring sleep?\n\n\u201cWhile sleep headphones are generally safe, there are potential health risks\nto consider,\u201d warns Shariff. \u201cWearing headphones that are too tight or have a\nhard headband could lead to discomfort or headaches, and listening to music at\nhigh volumes during sleep could impact your hearing over time. To mitigate\nrisks, I recommend choosing headphones with a comfortable fit and use a volume\nlevel that allows you to hear your surroundings. Whilst you can choose to\nsleep with earbuds in, and there are products designed for just this, users\nshould be aware of bacteria build up from having these in overnight, and as\nsuch may want to factor this into their purchasing decision if the possibility\nof infection is a concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf sound is played at too high of a level, then permanent hearing damage can\noccur,\u201d reiterates Olson. \u201cThis is incredibly risky if the device that you\u2019re\nconnected to doesn't warn you about the decibel level. You also have to\nconsider safety concerns, such as sleeping with consumer electronics that use\na lithium battery, as well as concerns of not being able to hear alarms such\nas smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and possible home intruders.\u201d\n\nThe information presented here is created independently from the TIME\neditorial staff.
