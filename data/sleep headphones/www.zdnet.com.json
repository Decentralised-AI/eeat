While sound machines can be an effective solution, sleep earbuds\noffer a more compact, subtle, and personal approach. Sleep earbuds can be a\nlovely gift for the tosser and turner in your life who is always lacking a\ngood night's sleep, and ahead of the holidays, you can snatch a pair at a\ndiscounted price.\n\nFrom both ZDNET testing and extensive research of products, we found sleep\nheadphones equipped with flat speakers, active noise canceling (ANC)\ntechnology, and a long-lasting battery life that can be a game changer for a\ngood night's rest, especially if noise is your number one nightmare. Some are\nearbuds that stick in your ear for the whole night, and others wrap around\nyour head or eyes for a quicker and easier descent into slumber.\n\n **Also:** **The best noise-canceling headphones for working and studying**\n\nOur pick for the top sleep headphones is the Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10\nearbuds, for their in-ear alarm features, sleep-tracking capabilities, and\nbattery life. Find out how some of the sleep headphones we've tested stack up\non this list -- and on your pillow.\n\n## The best sleep headphones of 2023\n\n## Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 Earbuds\n\n### Best sleep earbuds overall\n\nChristina Darby/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * In-ear alarm feature \n  * Tracks your sleep when you wear them overnight \n  * Choose from pre-set sleep sounds\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Small size might get lost in bed when tossing and turning \n  * Not the most comfortable for side sleepers\n\nMore Details\n\n**Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 Earbuds t** **ech specs: Form factor:** In-ear\n| **Connectivity:**  Bluetooth |  **Battery** : Up to 10 hours | **Fit:**\nEarbuds\n\nNot only are these earbuds from Anker small and comfortable enough to sleep\nin, but they also track your sleep while you wear them. Find out whether you\npassed the night in a deep or light sleep as well as how long you spent awake\neach night for a greater grasp on your sleeping patterns.\n\nWhen ZDNET writer Christina Darby reviewed the Anker Sleep A10 earbuds, she\ncalled them a \"refreshing addition to a rather scarce market.\"\n\n **Review:  ** **Do sleeping earbuds actually work? I tested the latest pair\non the market**\n\nAs far as sound goes, these headphones use noise masking, broadcasting a low-\nvolume layer of audio to cover up ambient sounds. You can choose from 31\ndifferent pre-set sounds in the Soundcore app's Sleep Music Library, including\naudio that mimics your brain wave frequencies during periods of rest.\n\nSee price at Best BuySee price at TargetSee price at B&H Photo-Video\n\nmore buying choices\n\n## QuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds\n\n### Best small earbuds with ANC\n\nChristina Darby/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Lightweight \n  * Great for side sleepers \n  * ANC is fantastic\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * No music playback, just white noise \n  * Pricey\n\nMore Details\n\n**QuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds tech specs:**   **Form factor:** Earbuds |\n**Connectivity:**  NA |  **Battery:** 28 hours | **Fit:** In-ear\n\nUsing ANC technology while still having a form factor designed for sleep,\nQuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds are like an elevated pair of earbuds. Weighing just\n1.8 grams, the lightweight feel is especially noticeable against a pillow --\neven if you're a side sleeper.\n\nThese earbuds are interesting because they actually don't play music, making\nthem more like smart earplugs. That said, QuietOn uses advanced ANC technology\nthat makes it easy to block out usual sleep distractions.\n\nWith no app, music, or Bluetooth connection, these are great if you simply\nwant a silent night's sleep, which, according to her product spotlight, Darby\ndid comfortably.\n\n\"As a noise-sensitive sleeper myself, I've tried sleeping with my 2nd-gen\nAirPods Pros before but found them too bulky. Therefore, I was impressed to\nfind QuietOn's ANC comparable to Apple's while feeling less irritating to wear\nduring sleep,\" she wrote.  \n\nThe earbuds have a 28-hour battery life and a frictionless fit with foam ear\ntips, which is ideal if all you want is silence and are willing to justify the\nprice tag.\n\nSee price at Quieton\n\n## Bedphones Wireless\n\n### Best headphones for sleeping\n\nBedphones/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Long battery life \n  * Comfortable for side sleepers \n  * Cable slider and adjustable hooks ensure a secure fit all night\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Expensive\n\nMore Details\n\n**Bedphones Wireless t** **ech specs:  ** **Form factor:** Over-ear |\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth | **Battery life:** 13 hours |  **Fit:\n**Adjustable ear hooks\n\nIf you want headphones made for sleeping, look no further than the Bedphones.\nThese headphones were designed with side sleepers in mind, as the speakers are\nthin and covered in soft foam padding. They lay flat against your ears while\nyou listen to soothing sounds.\n\nThe adjustable memory wire ear hooks allow these sleeping headphones to fit\nall ears. While wireless, a cable connects the two drivers, and you can wear\nthe cable in front of or behind your neck and tighten the cable slider to\nensure the headphones stay secure even on restless nights.\n\nThe 13-hour battery life and inline microphone with a single-button remote are\nalso impressive features.\n\nSee price at DubsLabs\n\n## Perytong Sleep Headphones\n\n### Best budget-friendly sleep headphones\n\nPerytong/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Affordable \n  * Comfortable to wear\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * No auto-off feature \n  * Volume can be loud even on the lowest setting\n\nMore Details\n\n**Perytong Sleep Headphones  ** **tech specs: Form factor:  **On-ear |\n**Connectivity:**  Bluetooth |  **Battery life:  **10 hours |  **Fit:\n**Headband\n\nThis headband headphone design from Perytong is a more budget-friendly option\nfor sleeping headphones. The headband is made of soft, machine-washable,\nbreathable material and features detachable on-ear headphones that can\ncomfortably fit back and side sleepers.\n\nThe headband holds a decent battery life that lasts 10 hours per full charge\nand comes in more than 15 color options.

By blocking\nout light in your room, the Musicozy wireless sleep mask headphones are a\nperfect option for light sleepers. The breathable fabric comes in 15 color\noptions that contain over-ear headphones inside the mask.\n\nWith these sleeping headphones, you'll get about 10 or more hours of playtime.\nThe built-in adjustable speakers also have a microphone if you need to take an\nearly-morning call without ever opening your eyes.\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n## What are the best headphones for sleeping?\n\nThe best sleep headphones are the Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 headphones for\ntheir strong battery life, sleep-tracking capabilities, and pre-set sleep\nsounds you can use to easily fall asleep.\n\n **Sleeping** **headphones**|  **Price**|  **Battery**|  **Form** **factor**  \n---|---|---|---  \nSoundcore by Anker Sleep A10| $90| 10 hours| In-ear  \nQuietOn 3.1 earbuds| $289| 28 hours| In-ear  \nBedphones wireless| $149| 13 hours| Over-ear  \nPerytong Sleep Headphones| $16| 10 hours| Over-ear  \nMusicozy Wireless Sleep Mask Headphones| $10| 10+ hours| Over-ear  \n  \n *Lowest price at the time of writing.

If you're a side sleeper, the\nflat and foam-padded design was made with you in mind. You'll also get 13\nhours of battery life.  \nPerytong Sleep Headphones| The best budget-friendly sleep headphones.

You heard that right, this sleep mask reaches your ears, blocking both\nsunlight and sound.  \n  \n## How did we choose these headphones for sleeping?\n\nWe selected these top sleeping headphones by doing extensive research into the\nproduct category, as well as performing some testing of our own while\nconsidering the following factors:\n\n  *  **Flat speakers:**  There's no point in sleeping in headphones if they're not comfortable -- and nothing is more uncomfortable than something poking in your ears. We looked for headphones with speakers that sit comfortably in your ears and against your pillow. \n  *  **Active Noise Canceling capabilities:**  We looked for headphones that cancel or block out noise so that you can have undisturbed rest. \n  *  **Battery life:**  All of our picks have battery life that will last you through the night from six to 28 hours. \n  *  **Price:** The sleeping headphones on this list range in price from $12 to $300. While you don't need to spend hundreds on a pair of good-quality sleep headphones, more features come with a higher price tag. \n\n## Is it OK to sleep with headphones on?\n\nYes, it is medically safe to fall asleep while wearing headphones. It is\nrecommended to keep the volume below 85 dB. Also, over-ear or on-ear\nheadphones are preferred over earbuds when considering long-term use since wax\nbuildup and ear canal damage can potentially happen over time with earbud use.\nSo if you're concerned with that, consider a sleep headphone headband instead\nof one of the earbuds on the list.\n\n## Are noise-canceling headphones good for sleeping?\n\nNoise-canceling headphones are great for sleeping since they have built-in\ntechnology that virtually blocks out any noise in your bedroom, making it\neasier to fall asleep in silence.\n\nHowever, noise-canceling headphones for sleeping are not the best option in\nthe case of an emergency since you're essentially tuned out to the world --\nespecially if you already consider yourself a heavy sleeper.\n\n## Are there alternative headphones for sleeping worth considering?\n\nOf course, you could always fall asleep using the headphones you already have\n-- they just might not be as comfortable or made for sleep as much as our top\npicks. So here are some other options we recommend.\n\n### Best Bluetooth headphone alternative\n\n## SleepPhones Bluetooth sleep headphones\n\nStream brown or white noise through these Bluetooth headphones for a night of\neasy dreaming.\n\nView at Amazon\n\n### Best headphone alternative for side sleepers\n\n## Bonamour Sleep System\n\nThe Bonamour Sleep System uses sound brainwave entrainment technology to get\nyou to sleep and keep you there. These sleep earbuds, according to Bonamour's\nproduct page, are great for side sleepers.\n\nView at Bonamour Sleep System\n\n### Best headphone alternative\n\n## Loop Quiet Earplugs\n\nThese aren't headphones, but ZDNET commerce editor Nina Raemont uses them to\ngo to bed every night and mute the city sounds outside her window, and she\ncan't recommend the earplugs enough. If you want to ditch the tech and reduce\nup to 26 decibels of noise, consider the Loop Quiet earplugs as an amazing\noption for easy sleeping.\n\nView at Amazon\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Recommends\n\nZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals\nto your inbox every week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\n#### **ZDNET** Recommends\n\nThe best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\n\nThe 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\n\nThe best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\n\nThe best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\n\n  * The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared \n\n  * The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you) \n\n  * The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick) \n\n  * The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money) \n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment  Community Guidelines\n\n###\n\n### Related\n\n###  The best headphone deals of 2024: AirPods, Beats, Bose, and more\n\n###  The best headphones you can buy\n\n###  The best headphones of CES 2024\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.

While sound machines can be an effective solution, sleep earbuds\noffer a more compact, subtle, and personal approach. Sleep earbuds can be a\nlovely gift for the tosser and turner in your life who is always lacking a\ngood night's sleep, and ahead of the holidays, you can snatch a pair at a\ndiscounted price.\n\nFrom both ZDNET testing and extensive research of products, we found sleep\nheadphones equipped with flat speakers, active noise canceling (ANC)\ntechnology, and a long-lasting battery life that can be a game changer for a\ngood night's rest, especially if noise is your number one nightmare. Some are\nearbuds that stick in your ear for the whole night, and others wrap around\nyour head or eyes for a quicker and easier descent into slumber.\n\n **Also:** **The best noise-canceling headphones for working and studying**\n\nOur pick for the top sleep headphones is the Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10\nearbuds, for their in-ear alarm features, sleep-tracking capabilities, and\nbattery life. Find out how some of the sleep headphones we've tested stack up\non this list -- and on your pillow.\n\n## The best sleep headphones of 2023\n\n## Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 Earbuds\n\n### Best sleep earbuds overall\n\nChristina Darby/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * In-ear alarm feature \n  * Tracks your sleep when you wear them overnight \n  * Choose from pre-set sleep sounds\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Small size might get lost in bed when tossing and turning \n  * Not the most comfortable for side sleepers\n\nMore Details\n\n**Soundcore by Anker Sleep A10 Earbuds t** **ech specs: Form factor:** In-ear\n| **Connectivity:**  Bluetooth |  **Battery** : Up to 10 hours | **Fit:**\nEarbuds\n\nNot only are these earbuds from Anker small and comfortable enough to sleep\nin, but they also track your sleep while you wear them. Find out whether you\npassed the night in a deep or light sleep as well as how long you spent awake\neach night for a greater grasp on your sleeping patterns.\n\nWhen ZDNET writer Christina Darby reviewed the Anker Sleep A10 earbuds, she\ncalled them a \"refreshing addition to a rather scarce market.\"\n\n **Review:  ** **Do sleeping earbuds actually work? I tested the latest pair\non the market**\n\nAs far as sound goes, these headphones use noise masking, broadcasting a low-\nvolume layer of audio to cover up ambient sounds. You can choose from 31\ndifferent pre-set sounds in the Soundcore app's Sleep Music Library, including\naudio that mimics your brain wave frequencies during periods of rest.\n\nShop now at Best BuyShop now at TargetShop now at B&H Photo-Video\n\nmore buying choices\n\n## QuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds\n\n### Best small earbuds with ANC\n\nChristina Darby/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Lightweight \n  * Great for side sleepers \n  * ANC is fantastic\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * No music playback, just white noise \n  * Pricey\n\nMore Details\n\n**QuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds tech specs:**   **Form factor:** Earbuds |\n**Connectivity:**  NA |  **Battery:** 28 hours | **Fit:** In-ear\n\nUsing ANC technology while still having a form factor designed for sleep,\nQuietOn 3.1 sleep earbuds are like an elevated pair of earbuds. Weighing just\n1.8 grams, the lightweight feel is especially noticeable against a pillow --\neven if you're a side sleeper.\n\nThese earbuds are interesting because they actually don't play music, making\nthem more like smart earplugs. That said, QuietOn uses advanced ANC technology\nthat makes it easy to block out usual sleep distractions.\n\nWith no app, music, or Bluetooth connection, these are great if you simply\nwant a silent night's sleep, which, according to her product spotlight, Darby\ndid comfortably.\n\n\"As a noise-sensitive sleeper myself, I've tried sleeping with my 2nd-gen\nAirPods Pros before but found them too bulky. Therefore, I was impressed to\nfind QuietOn's ANC comparable to Apple's while feeling less irritating to wear\nduring sleep,\" she wrote.  \n\nThe earbuds have a 28-hour battery life and a frictionless fit with foam ear\ntips, which is ideal if all you want is silence and are willing to justify the\nprice tag.\n\nShop now at Quieton\n\n## Bedphones Wireless\n\n### Best headphones for sleeping\n\nBedphones/ZDNET\n\nPros & Cons\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Long battery life \n  * Comfortable for side sleepers \n  * Cable slider and adjustable hooks ensure a secure fit all night\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Expensive\n\nMore Details\n\n**Bedphones Wireless t** **ech specs:  ** **Form factor:** Over-ear |\n**Connectivity:** Bluetooth | **Battery life:** 13 hours |  **Fit:\n**Adjustable ear hooks\n\nIf you want headphones made for sleeping, look no further than the Bedphones.\nThese headphones were designed with side sleepers in mind, as the speakers are\nthin and covered in soft foam padding. They lay flat against your ears while\nyou listen to soothing sounds.\n\nThe adjustable memory wire ear hooks allow these sleeping headphones to fit\nall ears.

You heard that right, this sleep mask reaches your ears, blocking both\nsunlight and sound.  \n  \n## How did we choose these headphones for sleeping?\n\nWe selected these top sleeping headphones by doing extensive research into the\nproduct category, as well as performing some testing of our own while\nconsidering the following factors:\n\n  *  **Flat speakers:**  There's no point in sleeping in headphones if they're not comfortable -- and nothing is more uncomfortable than something poking in your ears. We looked for headphones with speakers that sit comfortably in your ears and against your pillow. \n  *  **Active Noise Canceling capabilities:**  We looked for headphones that cancel or block out noise so that you can have undisturbed rest. \n  *  **Battery life:**  All of our picks have battery life that will last you through the night from six to 28 hours. \n  *  **Price:** The sleeping headphones on this list range in price from $12 to $300. While you don't need to spend hundreds on a pair of good-quality sleep headphones, more features come with a higher price tag. \n\n## Is it OK to sleep with headphones on?\n\nYes, it is medically safe to fall asleep while wearing headphones. It is\nrecommended to keep the volume below 85 dB. Also, over-ear or on-ear\nheadphones are preferred over earbuds when considering long-term use since wax\nbuildup and ear canal damage can potentially happen over time with earbud use.\nSo if you're concerned with that, consider a sleep headphone headband instead\nof one of the earbuds on the list.\n\n## Are noise-canceling headphones good for sleeping?\n\nNoise-canceling headphones are great for sleeping since they have built-in\ntechnology that virtually blocks out any noise in your bedroom, making it\neasier to fall asleep in silence.\n\nHowever, noise-canceling headphones for sleeping are not the best option in\nthe case of an emergency since you're essentially tuned out to the world --\nespecially if you already consider yourself a heavy sleeper.\n\n## Are there alternative headphones for sleeping worth considering?\n\nOf course, you could always fall asleep using the headphones you already have\n-- they just might not be as comfortable or made for sleep as much as our top\npicks. So here are some other options we recommend.\n\n### Best Bluetooth headphone alternative\n\n## SleepPhones Bluetooth sleep headphones\n\nStream brown or white noise through these Bluetooth headphones for a night of\neasy dreaming.\n\nView at Amazon\n\n### Best headphone alternative for side sleepers\n\n## Bonamour Sleep System\n\nThe Bonamour Sleep System uses sound brainwave entrainment technology to get\nyou to sleep and keep you there. These sleep earbuds, according to Bonamour's\nproduct page, are great for side sleepers.\n\nView at Bonamour Sleep System\n\n### Best headphone alternative\n\n## Loop Quiet Earplugs\n\nThese aren't headphones, but ZDNET commerce editor Nina Raemont uses them to\ngo to bed every night and mute the city sounds outside her window, and she\ncan't recommend the earplugs enough. If you want to ditch the tech and reduce\nup to 26 decibels of noise, consider the Loop Quiet earplugs as an amazing\noption for easy sleeping.\n\nView at Amazon\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Recommends\n\nZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals\nto your inbox every week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\n#### **ZDNET** Recommends\n\nThe best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\n\nThe 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\n\nThe best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\n\nThe best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\n\n  * The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared \n\n  * The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you) \n\n  * The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick) \n\n  * The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money) \n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment  Community Guidelines\n\n###\n\n### Related\n\n###  The best headphone deals of 2024: AirPods, Beats, Bose, and more\n\n###  The best headphones you can buy\n\n###  The best headphones of CES 2024\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
