You lose out on the cost of electricity (vs just renting out a server)**  \n **2\\. It's noisy**  \n **3\\. It's not portable**\n\nHe uses cloud GPUs and allows him to generate even when he's not at his home.\n\nHowever, for me, I spend 95% of my time at home.\n\nAnd I do have the funds to buy a new rig, however, it is quite pricey to get\nan RTX 4090 rn, which I've heard was the best in terms of performance in SD.\n\nBut I wanted to buy the best today because who knows what's gonna happen in\n5-8 months if I buy lesser GPUs.\n\nWhat do you guys think is smart?\n\n**Buy your own GPU/computer set or just rent powerful GPU online?**\n\nRead more\n\nLocked post.

So you're saying, in terms of performance, they're mostly the same with\nthe 4090? Didn't know VRAM is all that matters. But that's definhitely good to\nknow!

The advantage of getting a good SD setup is that it results in a very\nnice gaming rig too.\n\nI'm glad you mentioned heat though. 12900 and 3090TI here and sure, my rig is\nwell built and doesn't overheat but that heat still has to go somewhere so I\nbasically have a 500 Watt space heater under my desk. ;)\n\nReply  reply\n\n2 more replies\n\n2 more replies\n\nWhereIsMyBinky\n\n\u2022 5 mo. ago\n\nColab is $0.10 per compute unit whether you pay monthly or pay as you go. In\nmy experience, a T4 16gb GPU is ~2 compute units/hour, a V100 16gb is ~6\ncompute units/hour, and an A100 40gb is ~15 compute units/hour.\n\nThat comes out to ~$0.20/hour for a T4, ~$0.60/hour for a V100, and\n~$1.50/hour for an A100.\n\nAssuming you pay $1,600 for a 4090 and use about 30 hours per month (based on\nanother post you made in this thread), that means the same price would give\nyou:\n\n  * T4 16gb: 8,000 hours / 22 years \n\n  * V100 16gb: 2,670 hours / 7 years \n\n  * A100 40gb: 1,070 hours / 3 years \n\n(Someone feel free to check my math here, it\u2019s possible I\u2019ve made a mistake\nsomewhere.)\n\nI\u2019ve heard that other cloud computing services are cheaper than Colab.\n\nAn advantage to something like Colab is that you have access to an A100 when\nyou need it - for example, training. A T4 or V100 will be plenty of GPU the\nother 99% of the time. Another advantage is that you aren\u2019t taxing your own\nsystem during generation, so you can do other stuff without worrying about GPU\nusage. You also don\u2019t have your own system overhead to deal with.\n\nOne big downside to Colab is that you will get kicked for inactivity/long\nsessions. This is still true for paid Colab. So it\u2019s much more difficult to\nrun a training overnight for example. Additionally, it can be buggy although\nit\u2019s hard for me to say how much of this is Colab vs. normal A1111 issues.\nLastly, you\u2019re relying on cloud storage which is another cost you have to take\ninto account. I think it\u2019s like $10/month for 100gb Google Drive.\n\nI think everyone will have their own use case that drives their decision, but\npersonally I don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy a 4090 for 30 hours/month of\ngeneration time. By the time that card pays for itself at that rate, it will\nhave been obsolete for quite a long time.\n\nReply  reply\n\nPhilosopher_Jazzlike\n\n\u2022 5 mo. ago\n\nJust for creating Imgs in 8k-16k and train loras and stuff a rtx 3060 12gb is\nway enough. So i would ever buy again that GPU for 350\u20ac.\n\nReply  reply\n\nAbleObject13\n\n\u2022 5 mo. ago\n\n> It's not portable\n\nGradio, the web UI a1111 uses, will let you host a private link for up to 72\nhours using their servers.

This means you will it find anyone with a\nbunch of 2xxx, or 3xxx, or titians available for rent, or if you do they will\nnot be around for long.\n\nEdit: The EULA for the GeForce Driver bans use in data centers.
