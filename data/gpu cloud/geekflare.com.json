It used to kill their time, cost\nthem a lot, and left them with storage and space issues, reducing\nproductivity.\n\nThe new age GPUs are designed to solve this problem. They offer high\nefficiency to perform heavy computations and faster trAIning for your AI\nmodels in parallel.\n\nAccording to Indigo research, GPUs can offer 250 times faster performance than\nCPUs while training neural networks associated with deep learning.\n\nAnd with the advancement of cloud computing, we have cloud GPUs now that are\ntransforming the world of data science and other emerging technologies by\noffering even faster performance, easy maintenance, reduced cost, quick\nscaling, and saving time.\n\nThis article will introduce you to cloud GPU concepts, how it relates to AI,\nML, deep learning, and some of the best cloud GPU platforms you can find to\ndeploy your preferred cloud GPU.\n\nLet\u2019s begin!\n\n### What Is A Cloud GPU?\n\nTo understand a cloud GPU, let\u2019s first talk about GPUs.\n\nA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) refers to a specialized electronic circuit\nused to alter and manipulate memory rapidly to accelerate creating images or\ngraphics.\n\nModern GPUs offer higher efficiency in manipulating image processing and\ncomputer graphics due to their parallel structure than Central Processing\nUnits (CPUs). A GPU is embedded on its motherboard or placed on a PC\u2019s video\ncard or CPU die.\n\nCloud Graphics Units (GPUs) are computer instances with robust hardware\nacceleration helpful for running applications to handle massive AI and deep\nlearning workloads in the cloud. It does not need you to deploy a physical GPU\non your device.\n\nSome popular GPUs are NVIDIA, AMD, Radeon, GeForce, and more.\n\nGPUs are utilized in:\n\n  * Mobile phones\n  * Game consoles\n  * Workstations\n  * Embedded systems\n  * Personal computers\n\n### What Are GPUs Used for:\n\nHere are some use cases of GPUs:\n\n  * In AI and ML for image recognition\n  * Calculations for 3D computer graphics and CAD drawings\n  * Texture mapping and rendering polygons\n  * Geometric calculations like translations and rotations of vertices into coordinate systems\n  * Supporting programmable shaders to manipulate textures and vertices\n  * GPU-accelerated video encoding, decoding, and streaming\n  * Graphics-rich gaming and cloud gaming\n  * Wide-scale mathematical modeling, analytics, and deep learning that require parallel processing capabilities of general-purpose GPUs.\n  * Video editing, graphic designing, and content creation\n\n### What Are the Benefits of Cloud GPUs? \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe key benefits of using Cloud GPUs are:\n\n#### Highly Scalable\n\nIf you want to expand your organization, its workload will eventually\nincrease. You will need a GPU that can scale with your increased workload.\nCloud GPUs can help you do that by letting you add more GPUs easily without\nany hassles so you can meet your increased workloads. Conversely, if you want\nto scale down, this is also possible quickly.\n\n#### Minimizes Cost\n\nInstead of buying physical GPUs of high power that costs incredibly high, you\ncan go with cloud GPUs on a rental that is available at a lower cost on an\nhourly basis. You will be charged for the number of hours you have used the\ncloud GPUs, unlike the physical ones that would have cost you high even though\nyou don\u2019t use them much.\n\n#### Clears Local Resources\n\nCloud GPUs don\u2019t consume your local resources, unlike physical GPUs that\noccupy a significant amount of space on your computer. Not to mention, if you\nrun a large-scale ML model or render a task, it slows down your computer.\n\nTo this, you can consider outsourcing the computational power to the cloud\nwithout stressing your computer and use it with ease. Just use the computer to\ncontrol everything instead of giving it all the pressure to handle the\nworkload and computational tasks.\n\n#### Saves time\n\nCloud GPUs give designers the flexibility of rapid iteration with faster\nrendering times. You can save a lot of time by completing a task in minutes\nthat used to take hours or days. Hence, your team\u2019s productivity will increase\nsignificantly so that you can invest time in innovation instead of rendering\nor computations.\n\n### How Do GPUs Help in Deep Learning and AI?\n\nDeep learning is the basis of artificial intelligence. It is an advanced ML\ntechnique that emphasizes representational learning with the help of\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The deep learning model is used to process\nlarge datasets or highly computational processes.\n\nSo, how do GPUs come into the picture?\n\nGPUs are designed to perform parallel computations or multiple calculations\nsimultaneously. GPUs can leverage the capability of the deep learning model to\nexpedite large computational tasks.\n\nAs GPUs have many cores, they offer excellent parallel processing\ncomputations. In addition, they have higher memory bandwidth to accommodate\nmassive amounts of data for deep learning systems. Hence, they are used widely\nfor training AI models, rendering CAD models, playing graphics-rich video\ngames, and more.\n\nMoreover, if you want to experiment with multiple algorithms simultaneously,\nyou can run numerous GPUs separately. It facilitates different processes on\nseparate GPUs without parallelism. For this, you can use multiple GPUs across\ndifferent physical machines or in a single machine to distribute heavy data\nmodels.\n\n### How You Can Get Started With Cloud GPU\n\nGetting started with cloud GPUs is not rocket science. In fact, everything is\neasy and quick if you can understand the basics. First of all, you need to\nchoose a cloud GPU provider, for instance, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\nNext, sign up for GCP.
