Get started\n\n# GPU\n\n  * Overview\n  * Use cases\n  * How to\n  * Prices\n  * Create a project\n\n  *   * Public Cloud\n  * Compute\n  * GPU\n\n##  GPU cloud servers, designed for massive parallel processing\n\nGPU instances leverage NVIDIA Tesla V100S graphic processors to deliver the\npower and performance needed for massive parallel processing, including\nmachine learning and deep learning projects. They are available on demand and\ncan be purchased on a monthly or hourly basis.\n\nStart Now\n\n###  Powered by NVIDIA Tesla V100S\n\nThese GPUs are among the most powerful on the market and are designed for use\nin data centers. They accelerate computing in the fields of artificial\nintelligence (AI) and graphic computing.\n\n###  NVIDIA GPU Cloud\n\nTo provide the best user experience, OVHcloud and NVIDIA have partnered up to\noffer an excellent GPU-accelerated platform. Designed for deep learning and\nhigh-performance computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). It is one of the\nsimplest ways to deploy and maintain GPU-accelerated containers.\n\n###  Between one and four cards with guaranteed performance\n\nTesla cards are delivered directly to the instance via PCI Passthrough,\nwithout a virtualization layer. This gives you full usage of the cards as they\nare fully dedicated to your instance. Up to four cards can be connected to\ncombine their performance. As a result, the hardware delivers all of its\ncomputing power to your application.\n\nIcons/concept/Page/Page Certificate Created with Sketch.\n\n###  ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, & 27701 Certificate and HIPAA Attestation\n\nOur cloud infrastructures and services are ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, and\n27701 certified. These certifications demonstrate the presence of an\ninformation security management system (ISMS) for managing risks, and\nvulnerabilities and implementing business continuity, as well as a privacy\ninformation management system (PIMS).\n\n## NVIDIA Tesla V100S Features\n\nPerformance with NVIDIA GPU Boost |\n\nBidirectional connection bandwidth\n\n| CoWoS Stacked HBM2 memory  \n---|---|---  \n  \n  * double-precision: 8.2 TeraFLOPS\n  * single-precision: 16.4 TeraFLOPS\n  * tensor performance: 130 TeraFLOPS\n\n|\n\n  * PCIe 32 GB/s\n\n|\n\n  * capacity: 32 GB HBM2\n  * bandwidth: 1134 GB/s\n\n  \n  \n\n\n## Use cases\n\n###  Image recognition\n\nExtracting data from images to classify them, identify an element or build\nricher documents is necessary for many industries. With frameworks like Caffe2\ncombined with the Tesla V100S GPU, medical imaging, social networks, public\nprotection, and security become easily accessible.\n\n###  Situation analysis\n\nReal-time analysis is required in some cases, where an appropriate reaction is\nexpected to face varied and unpredictable situations. This kind of technology\nis used for self-driving cars and internet network traffic analysis, for\nexample. This is where deep learning comes in, to form neural networks that\nlearn independently through a training stage.\n\n###  Human interaction\n\nIn the past, people learned to communicate with machines. We are now in an era\nwhere machines are learning to communicate with people. Whether through speech\nrecognition or emotion recognition through sound and video, tools such as\nTensorFlow push the boundaries of these interactions, opening up a multitude\nof new uses.\n\n## How to\n\n1\n\n### Start\n\nLaunch your instance by choosing a T1 model and NGC image to suit you.\n\n2\n\n### Configure\n\n$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow  \n$ nvidia-docker run nvidia/tensorflow t1\n\n3\n\n### Use\n\nYour AI framework is now ready to go!\n\nReady to get started?\n\nCreate an account and launch your services in minutes\n\nGet Started\n\n## GPU billing\n\nGPU instances are billed like all of our other instances, on a pay-as-you-go\nbasis at the end of each month. The price depends on the size of the instance\nyou have booted, and the duration of its use.\n\nSee the price list\n\n## Other products\n\nGuaranteed Resources\n\nDeploy cloud instances with fully-guaranteed resources that cover a very wide\nrange of uses.\n\nFind out more\n\nDiscovery\n\nStart your Public Cloud journey with instances that have shared resources,\ndelivering stable performance at a very affordable price.\n\nFind out more\n\n## FAQ\n\n###  What SLA does OVHcloud guarantee for a GPU instance?\n\nThe SLA guarantees 99.99% monthly availability on GPU instances. For further\ninformation, please refer to the Terms of Service.\n\n###  Which hypervisor is used for instance virtualization?\n\nJust like other instances, GPU instances are virtualized by the KVM hypervisor\nin the Linux kernel.\n\n###  What is PCI Passthrough?\n\nCards with GPUs are served via the physical server's PCI bus. PCI Passthrough\nis a hypervisor feature that allows you to dedicate hardware to a virtual\nmachine by giving direct access to the PCI bus, without going through\nvirtualization.\n\n###  Can I resize a GPU instance?\n\nYes, GPU instances can be upgraded to a higher model after a reboot. However,\nthey cannot be downgraded to a lower model.\n\n###  Do GPU instances have anti-DDoS protection?\n\nYes, our anti-DDoS protection is included with all OVHcloud solutions at no\nextra cost.\n\n###  If my instance is on a monthly billing cycle, can I switch over to an\nhourly billing cycle in the middle of the month?\n\nIf your instance is on a monthly billing cycle, you cannot switch to an hourly\nbilling cycle in the middle of the month. Before you launch an instance,\nplease take care to select the billing method that is best suited to your\nproject.\n\n1\n\nReceive $400.00 (USD) in additional Public Cloud credits (the \"Additional\nCredits\") when you create your first Public Cloud infrastructure project.\nOffer applies only to Public Cloud services purchased from OVHcloud\ndatacenters in the United States.

Get started\n\n# GPU\n\n  * Overview\n  * Use cases\n  * How to\n  * Prices\n  * Create a project\n\n  *   * Public Cloud\n  * Compute\n  * GPU\n\n##  GPU cloud servers, designed for massive parallel processing\n\nGPU instances leverage NVIDIA Tesla V100S graphic processors to deliver the\npower and performance needed for massive parallel processing, including\nmachine learning and deep learning projects. They are available on demand and\ncan be purchased on a monthly or hourly basis.\n\nStart Now\n\n###  Powered by NVIDIA Tesla V100S\n\nThese GPUs are among the most powerful on the market and are designed for use\nin data centers. They accelerate computing in the fields of artificial\nintelligence (AI) and graphic computing.\n\n###  NVIDIA GPU Cloud\n\nTo provide the best user experience, OVHcloud and NVIDIA have partnered up to\noffer an excellent GPU-accelerated platform. Designed for deep learning and\nhigh-performance computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). It is one of the\nsimplest ways to deploy and maintain GPU-accelerated containers.\n\n###  Between one and four cards with guaranteed performance\n\nTesla cards are delivered directly to the instance via PCI Passthrough,\nwithout a virtualization layer. This gives you full usage of the cards as they\nare fully dedicated to your instance. Up to four cards can be connected to\ncombine their performance. As a result, the hardware delivers all of its\ncomputing power to your application.\n\nIcons/concept/Page/Page Certificate Created with Sketch.\n\n###  ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, & 27701 Certificate and HIPAA Attestation\n\nOur cloud infrastructures and services are ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, and\n27701 certified. These certifications demonstrate the presence of an\ninformation security management system (ISMS) for managing risks, and\nvulnerabilities and implementing business continuity, as well as a privacy\ninformation management system (PIMS).\n\n## NVIDIA Tesla V100S Features\n\nPerformance with NVIDIA GPU Boost |\n\nBidirectional connection bandwidth\n\n| CoWoS Stacked HBM2 memory  \n---|---|---  \n  \n  * double-precision: 8.2 TeraFLOPS\n  * single-precision: 16.4 TeraFLOPS\n  * tensor performance: 130 TeraFLOPS\n\n|\n\n  * PCIe 32 GB/s\n\n|\n\n  * capacity: 32 GB HBM2\n  * bandwidth: 1134 GB/s\n\n  \n  \n\n\n## Use cases\n\n###  Image recognition\n\nExtracting data from images to classify them, identify an element or build\nricher documents is necessary for many industries. With frameworks like Caffe2\ncombined with the Tesla V100S GPU, medical imaging, social networks, public\nprotection, and security become easily accessible.\n\n###  Situation analysis\n\nReal-time analysis is required in some cases, where an appropriate reaction is\nexpected to face varied and unpredictable situations. This kind of technology\nis used for self-driving cars and internet network traffic analysis, for\nexample. This is where deep learning comes in, to form neural networks that\nlearn independently through a training stage.\n\n###  Human interaction\n\nIn the past, people learned to communicate with machines. We are now in an era\nwhere machines are learning to communicate with people. Whether through speech\nrecognition or emotion recognition through sound and video, tools such as\nTensorFlow push the boundaries of these interactions, opening up a multitude\nof new uses.\n\n## How to\n\n1\n\n### Start\n\nLaunch your instance by choosing a T1 model and NGC image to suit you.\n\n2\n\n### Configure\n\n$ docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow  \n$ nvidia-docker run nvidia/tensorflow t1\n\n3\n\n### Use\n\nYour AI framework is now ready to go!\n\nReady to get started?\n\nCreate an account and launch your services in minutes\n\nGet Started\n\n## GPU billing\n\nGPU instances are billed like all of our other instances, on a pay-as-you-go\nbasis at the end of each month. The price depends on the size of the instance\nyou have booted, and the duration of its use.\n\nSee the price list\n\n## Other products\n\nGuaranteed Resources\n\nDeploy cloud instances with fully-guaranteed resources that cover a very wide\nrange of uses.\n\nFind out more\n\nDiscovery\n\nStart your Public Cloud journey with instances that have shared resources,\ndelivering stable performance at a very affordable price.\n\nFind out more\n\n## FAQ\n\n###  What SLA does OVHcloud guarantee for a GPU instance?\n\nThe SLA guarantees 99.99% monthly availability on GPU instances. For further\ninformation, please refer to the Terms of Service.\n\n###  Which hypervisor is used for instance virtualization?\n\nJust like other instances, GPU instances are virtualized by the KVM hypervisor\nin the Linux kernel.\n\n###  What is PCI Passthrough?\n\nCards with GPUs are served via the physical server's PCI bus. PCI Passthrough\nis a hypervisor feature that allows you to dedicate hardware to a virtual\nmachine by giving direct access to the PCI bus, without going through\nvirtualization.\n\n###  Can I resize a GPU instance?\n\nYes, GPU instances can be upgraded to a higher model after a reboot. However,\nthey cannot be downgraded to a lower model.\n\n###  Do GPU instances have anti-DDoS protection?\n\nYes, our anti-DDoS protection is included with all OVHcloud solutions at no\nextra cost.\n\n###  If my instance is on a monthly billing cycle, can I switch over to an\nhourly billing cycle in the middle of the month?\n\nIf your instance is on a monthly billing cycle, you cannot switch to an hourly\nbilling cycle in the middle of the month. Before you launch an instance,\nplease take care to select the billing method that is best suited to your\nproject.\n\n1\n\nReceive $400.00 (USD) in additional Public Cloud credits (the \"Additional\nCredits\") when you create your first Public Cloud infrastructure project.\nOffer applies only to Public Cloud services purchased from OVHcloud\ndatacenters in the United States.
