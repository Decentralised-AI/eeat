Both new and existing customers can\nrequest to use this special offer, provided that they have not already created\na Public Cloud project in the past, whether it is still active or not. Special\noffer available from 30 June 2022, 23:00 BST. The voucher must be activated\nwhen the holder creates their first Public Cloud project. The voucher is only\nvalid for the purchase of Public Cloud services provided by OVHcloud,\npurchased directly from OVHcloud via the website, in all available Public\nCloud regions, excluding free offers and free beta testing services. This\nvoucher cannot be used in conjunction with any other current special offers\napplicable to the services concerned, including the \u2018Public Cloud Free Trial\u2019\nspecial offer. The voucher applies to standard, non-discounted public rates\n(as published on the OVHcloud website). The voucher\u2019s value is listed in the\npublicly displayed currency for the market/country to which the Public Cloud\naccount with the voucher is attached, excluding taxes, and can only be used to\norder services in the same currency. The voucher is valid for the purchase of\nservices usually available in the market to which the NIC handle used is\nlinked. The voucher is assigned to a specific natural or legal person who\nalready has an OVHcloud customer account, and is linked to their OVHcloud NIC\nhandle (unique ID). If the natural or legal person has several NICs, the\nvoucher shall be attached to a single NIC. The voucher cannot then be linked\nto a different NIC handle, and only one voucher may be used. A single natural\nor legal person can only use one voucher, even if that person has several\ndifferent NIC handles. In the event that the voucher is used by a NIC handle\nother than the NIC handle to which the voucher is attached, OVHcloud reserves\nthe right to automatically cancel or terminate the services obtained as a\nresult, without reissuing the voucher and without legal formality or\ncompensation. The use of the voucher is subject to the full acceptance of\nthese conditions, as well as the General and Special Terms and Conditions\napplicable to the services obtained. These terms and conditions can be viewed\nat: https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/terms-and-conditions/contracts/. By way of\nexception, the amounts issued from this voucher do not form part of the base\nmonthly fee for services used in terms of service levels (SLAs) and associated\nextra charges \u2014 i.e. if the voucher holder uses an amount less than or equal\nto the voucher for a given month, no penalty will be paid for a breach of an\nSLA in the course of the service, while if the voucher holder uses a higher\namount, only the amounts paid above the voucher value will be taken into\naccount in calculating extra charges. The voucher is non-exchangeable, non-\nrefundable, and non-redeemable, even partially. It may not be given away, sold\nor transferred in any capacity whatsoever to a third party, either free of\ncharge or for a fee (it may not be transferred between separate legal entities\nof the same group of companies). The voucher can only be used for one Public\nCloud project, but can be used in one or more instalments on the project, and\ncan be used in conjunction with another payment method if required, until the\nbalance is used up or the voucher\u2019s validity period ends. To use this voucher,\nthe holder must have a valid payment method saved in their OVHcloud customer\naccount. Once the voucher has been activated in the holder\u2019s customer account,\nit is valid for a period of one (1) month, and is automatically deducted from\nthe bills linked to the Public Cloud project for which the voucher has been\nactivated. The voucher is not replaceable in the event of loss, theft,\ndestruction, end of validity or fraudulent use. Furthermore, in the event of\nnon-compliance with these conditions or of fraudulent use (including one\nperson using multiple vouchers), OVHcloud reserves the right to terminate the\nsubscribed services using the vouchers, and/or cancel the vouchers, and the\nholder will in all cases be liable to pay the full amounts to OVHcloud for the\nservices used, including the voucher amount, without prejudice to any\ncompensation that OVHcloud may claim.

With frameworks like Caffe2\ncombined with the Tesla V100S GPU, medical imaging, social networks, public\nprotection and security become easily accessible.\n\n###  Situation analysis\n\nReal-time analysis is required in some cases, where an appropriate reaction is\nexpected to face varied and unpredictable situations. This kind of technology\nis used for self-driving cars and internet network traffic analysis, for\nexample. This is where deep learning comes in, to form neural networks that\nlearn independently through a training stage.\n\n###  Human interaction\n\nIn the past, people learned to communicate with machines. We are now in an era\nwhere machines are learning to communicate with people. Whether through speech\nrecognition or the emotion recognition through sound and video, tools such as\nTensorFlow push the boundaries of these interactions, opening up a multitude\nof new uses.\n\n## Need to train your artificial intelligence with GPUs?\n\nWith our AI Training solution, you can train your AI models efficiently and\neasily, and optimise your GPU computing resources.\n\nFocus on your business instead of the infrastructure that supports it.
