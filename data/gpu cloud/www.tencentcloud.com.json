It is most suitable for the following\nuse cases:\n\n  * AI computing: Deep learning inference and training\n  * Graphics and image processing: Cloud game, cloud phone, cloud desktop, and CloudXR\n  * High-performance computing: Fluid dynamics, molecular modeling, meteorological engineering, seismic analysis, genomics, etc.\n\nHow do I select a GPU instance model?\n\nYou need to select an instance model based on your use case:\n\n  * AI training: GN10Xp, GN10X, GT4, GN8, and GN6/GN6S\n  * AI inference: GN7, GN10Xp, GN10X, PNV4, GI3X, GN6, and GN6S\n  * Graphics and image processing: GN7vw, GNV4, GNV4v, and GI1\n  * Scientific computing: GN10Xp, GN10X, GT4, and GI3X\n  * For more information, see Computing Instance and Rendering Instance.\n\nHow do I select a driver based on the instance model and scenario?\n\nNVIDIA GPU instance models include physical passthrough instances (having\nentire GPUs) and vGPU instances (having no entire GPUs, such as 1/4 GPU).\n\nThe GPU on a physical passthrough instance can use the Tesla or GRID driver\n(several models don't support the GRID driver) to accelerate computing in\ndifferent scenarios.\n\nA vGPU can use only the GRID driver on certain versions to accelerate\ncomputing.\n\nFor detailed directions on how to install a driver on an NVIDIA GPU instance,\nsee Installing NVIDIA Tesla Driver.\n\nDoes Cloud GPU Service allow you to adjust the configuration of an instance?\n\nGPU instance models PNV4, GT4, GN10X, GN10Xp, GN6, GN6S, GN7, GN8, GNV4v,\nGNV4, GN7vw, and GI1 support instance configuration adjustment in the same\ninstance family, while GI3X does not support instance configuration\nadjustment.\n\nWhat should I do if the resources are sold out when I purchase an instance?\n\nYou can try the following:\n\n  * Change the region\n  * Change the AZ\n  * Change the resource configuration\n\nIf the problem persists, please contact us.\n\nHow are GPU instances billed?\n\nGPU instances are pay-as-you-go, where the instances are billed by second and\nsettled hourly. You can purchase or release the instances at any time. For\nmore information, see Pricing Overview.\n\nHow can I get the estimated price of GPU instances?\n\nWhen you purchase GPU instances, you can check the estimated price in the\nPrice Calculator.\n\nWhat is the difference between a private IP and a public IP of a GPU instance?\n\nA private IP is a connection address that provides services for a client with\na source IP from the private network. A public IP is a connection address that\nenables public network communication for a client with a source IP from the\npublic network. They can be directly mapped to each other through network\naddress translation. GPU instances in the same region can communicate over the\nprivate network, while those in different regions can only communicate over\nthe public network.\n\nWhat is an EIP?\n\nAn EIP is a static IP specifically designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is\nregion-specific. You can quickly remap an EIP to another GPU instance (or a\nCVM/NAT gateway instance) under your account to block instance failures. For\nmore information, see EIP.\n\nWhat storage options does Cloud GPU Service offer?\n\nTencent Cloud provides different types of data storage options for GPU\ninstances, including cloud disk, local disk, COS, and block storage device\nmapping. Different options differ in performance and price and are suitable\nfor different use cases. For more information, see Storage Overview.\n\nWhat storage options does a CPM GPU instance offer?\n\nSome of the CPM GPU instance models support local storage, and you can use\nremote storage as needed.\n\n1\\. Local storage\n\nCertain CPM GPU instances are equipped with NVMe SSD disks with excellent\nread/write performance, which is three times higher than that of a general\nmodel, so as to guarantee the stability of high-performance computing jobs.\n\n2\\. Remote storage\n\nCFS: You can mount Turbo CFS through the smart ENI technology, which enables\nflexible expansion of storage capacity and guarantees strong consistency\nbetween three replicas.\n\nCOS: COS works with the distributed cluster architecture of GooseFS to improve\nthe data locality and uses the high-speed cache feature to improve the storage\nperformance and increase the bandwidth for writing data to COS.\n\nHow do I back up data in a GPU instance?\n\n1\\. If your GPU instance uses a cloud disk, you can back up your business data\nby creating a custom system disk image and a data disk snapshot\n\n  * For more information on how to create a custom image, see Creating Custom Image.\n  * For more information on how to create a snapshot, see Creating Snapshot.\n\n2\\. If your GPU instance uses a local disk, you can back up your business data\nby creating a custom system disk image. However, you need to customize backup\npolicies for the business data in your data disk. Usually, you can back up the\ndata in your GPU instance over FTP. For more information on FTP deployment,\nsee the following documents:\n\n  * For Windows: Setting up an FTP Site (Windows)\n  * For Linux: Setting up an FTP Site (Linux)\n\n3\\. In addition, if you require high data security, you can purchase more\nprofessional third-party custom backup services.\n\nWhat is a region?\n\nTencent Cloud regions are completely isolated. This guarantees the maximum\ncross-region stability and fault tolerance. We will gradually deploy nodes in\nmore regions for a wider coverage. We recommend you select the region closest\nto your end users to minimize the access latency and improve the download\nspeed. For more information on supported regions, see Regions and AZs.\n\nHow do I select an appropriate region?\n\nWe recommend you select the region closest to your users, and choose the same\nregion for your GPU instances so that communication can occur over the private\nnetwork.\n\n  * Close to your user: By selecting a region that is geographically close to your users, you can reduce their access latency and increase their access speed. For example, if most of your users are located near Southeast Asia, Singapore or Thailand will be a good choice.\n  * Intra-region communication: GPU instances in the same region can communicate over private network free of charge. When they are in different regions, they can only communicate over the public network, which incurs fees. To enable instances to communicate over the private network, you must select the same region for them.\n\nHow are AZs isolated from each other?\n\nEach AZ runs on its own independent and physically distinct infrastructure and\nis designed to be highly reliable. AZs do not share common vulnerable\nequipment such as power supplies and cooling equipment. In addition, they are\nphysically independent of each other, so if a natural disaster such as a fire,\ntornado, or flood occurs, only the AZ at that location would be affected while\nother AZs remain operational.\n\nWhere can I find more information on security?\n\nTencent Cloud provides various network and security services such as security\ngroups, encrypted login, and EIP to ensure the secure, efficient, and free\noperations of your instances. For more information on GPU security, see\nNetwork and Security Overview.\n\nHow do I prevent others from viewing my system?\n\nYou can control the access to your GPU instances by adding them into a\nsecurity group. You can also configure communication across security groups\nand specify which IP subnets can communicate with your instances.\n\nHow do I troubleshoot security issues?\n\nWhen security risks are detected, you can troubleshoot the issues as\ninstructed in Security Violation Handling Guide and resolve it as instructed\nin Cloud Workload Protection.\n\nDoes Cloud GPU Service provide images with a preinstalled GPU driver?\n\nIf you select a vGPU or Rendering instance, you can select an image with a\npreinstalled GRID driver in \u201cPublic images\u201d on the purchase page.\n\nWhat types of images are available?\n\nTencent Cloud provides public images, shared images, and custom images. For\nmore information, see Image Types. You can select appropriate images based on\ntheir different features.\n\nWhat is a shared image?\n\nYou can share a custom image with other users, or obtain images shared by\nothers. For more information on the limits and usage of shared images, see\nSharing Custom Images.\n\nHow many users can I share an image with?\n\nAn image can be shared with up to 50 users. Shared images do not count towards\nyour own image quota.\n\nTencent Cloud GPU Service\n\nAn Ultimate Parallel Computing Capabilities and Professional Computing\nAcceleration Service.
