Working in the cloud\nrequires some initial setup, but using cloud resources can significantly\naccelerate your code without requiring you to buy and set up your own local\nGPUs.\n\nMathWorks\u00ae provides several ways of accessing MATLAB in public clouds, such as\nAmazon\u00ae Web Services (AWS\u00ae) and Microsoft\u00ae Azure\u00ae, that you can configure\naccording to your needs. You can access a single machine in the cloud or, if\nyou have MATLAB Parallel Server\u2122, you can scale up to a cluster.\n\n### MathWorks Cloud Center\n\nFrom Cloud Center, you can create and manage cloud resources using your AWS\naccount, including accessing a single machine with MATLAB installed and a\nMATLAB Parallel Server cluster that you can access from any MATLAB session.\n\nTo get started with Cloud Center, see:\n\n  * Start MATLAB on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Using Cloud Center\n\n  * Start and Test MATLAB Parallel Server Cluster in Cloud Center\n\n**Note**\n\nWhen you create your cloud resource, choose a machine with GPUs, such as the\nP2, P3, P4, G3, or G5 instances. Instances P2, P3, and P4 have GPUs with high\nperformance for general computation. Instances G3 and G5 have GPUs with high\nsingle-precision performance for deep learning, image processing, computer\nvision, and automated driving simulations.\n\n### Microsoft Azure Marketplace\n\nYou can deploy MATLAB and MATLAB Parallel Server in the cloud using software\nplans developed by MathWorks for the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.\n\nTo get started with Microsoft Azure Marketplace, see:\n\n  * Run MATLAB from Microsoft Azure Marketplace\n\n  * Run MATLAB Parallel Server from Microsoft Azure Marketplace\n\n**Note**\n\n  * When selecting a virtual machine size, choose a machine with NVIDIA GPUs, such as the NCv3-series, the NC T4_v3-series, and the ND A100 v4-series virtual machines. These virtual machines are designed for compute-intensive workloads.\n\n### Reference Architectures\n\nMathWorks provides customizable reference architecture templates for AWS and\nAzure in GitHub\u00ae. Reference architecture templates grant you full control over\nyour cloud resources, including region and network settings that match your\nexisting cloud infrastructure.\n\nTo get started with reference architectures, see:\n\n  * AWS Reference Architectures\n\n  * Microsoft Azure Reference Architectures\n\n### Containers\n\nYou can also use containers to create software environments on desktop,\nserver, or cloud environments. Containers are isolated units of software that\ncontain everything required to run a specific application and are consistent,\nportable, and lightweight.\n\nTo get started with containers, see:\n\n  * MATLAB Deep Learning Container on Docker Hub\n\n  * MATLAB Deep Learning Container on NVIDIA GPU Cloud for Amazon Web Services\n\n  * MATLAB Deep Learning Container on Nvidia GPU Cloud for NVIDIA DGX\n\n**Note**\n\nBy default, a container does not have access to the hardware resources of its\nhost. To grant the container access to the NVIDIA GPUs of the host system:\n\n  * Run the container on a host system with the appropriate NVIDIA GPU drivers installed.\n\n  * Make the GPUs of the host visible to the container by using the `--gpus` flag when you execute the `docker run` command. Set this flag to `all` to grant the container access to all the GPUs of the host machine.\n\nFor more information, see Use GPUs in Containers.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Requirements for Using Cloud Center\n  * Link Cloud Account to Cloud Center\n  * What is a Container?\n  * Cloud AI Workflow Using the Deep Learning Container (Deep Learning Toolbox)\n  * Work with Remote Data\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nWhy did you choose this rating?
