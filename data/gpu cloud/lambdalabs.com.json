Priced at $4.40 / hr, our new instance provides over 2x\nmore compute per dollar than comparable on-demand 8 GPU instances from other\ncloud providers.\n\n### What\u2019s inside our new 8 GPU instance?\n\nWe\u2019ve built the cloud instances with the hardware you need to get started\ntraining even some of the largest data sets:\n\n  * **GPUs:** 8x (16 GB) NVIDIA Tensor Core V100 SXM2 GPUs (with NVLink\u2122)\n  * **CPU:** 92 vCPUs\n  * **System RAM:** 448 GB\n  * **Temporary Local Storage:** 6 TB NVMe\n  * **Network Interface:** 10 Gbps (peak)\n\n### A brief primer on NVLink\u2122\n\nWe get a lot of questions about the capabilities of NVLink from customers, so\nlet me take a brief moment to explain the misconception and show how NVLink\nworks on our new instance type.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that NVLink turns all of your GPUs into one\n\u201csuper GPU.\u201d While NVLink does improve the interconnect speeds between GPUs\nover PCIe 3.0 (supporting up to 300 GB/s), they _do not_ suddenly appear as\none GPU to your system. You\u2019ll still need to run your training workloads in a\ndistributed fashion, but they\u2019ll be much quicker at consolidating results\namong the GPUs.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious as to how they do communicate, the NVLink connections form\nthree concentric rings with which they can communicate this allows each GPU to\ncommunicate with its two closest neighbors over 100 GB/s of NVLink each, it\u2019s\nnext two closest with 50 GB/s each, and its four most distant neighbors over\nover ~15 GB/s PCIe Gen 3.0.\n\nWhile it might seem unideal, this schema is actually well-suited for ring-\nstyle algorithms used by many multi-GPU training tasks.\n\n### Calculating the cost of compute\n\nWe could tell you that our cloud instance costs 51% less than the comparable\non-demand 8 GPU instance from many major cloud providers. However, we\u2019re\npretty sure you wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with that answer and neither were we.\nSo, we set out to make sure this was an apples to apples comparison.\n\n  \nTo do this we ran a full suite of benchmarks testing image models, language\nmodels, machine translation, speech synthesis, and recommendation systems. The\nmodels were run using full precision (FP32), half precision (FP16), and, when\napplicable, automatic mixed precision (AMP).\n\n### 2x better than comparable on-demand\n\nWhile there was some variance among the individual model performance, when\naveraged across all use cases the Lambda Cloud 8-GPU V100 instance provides\n99.9% the performance of the comparable 8 GPU instance from a traditional\ncloud provider.[1]\n\nWhen we combine this with the Lambda Cloud on-demand price of $4.40 per hr (vs\n$24.48 per hr) the 8-GPU system provides just over 2x the compute power per\ndollar with an included 6 TB of temporary local NVMe storage.\n\nAdditionally, we do not require any extended 1 or 3 year contract for you to\nsee these savings, and we\u2019re still 30% less expensive than equivalent 1 year\ncontract pricing.\n\n### Not a spot instance\n\nA common method to provide discounts by many cloud providers (not just the\nmajor ones) is to provide access to \u201cspot\u201d or ephemeral instances that can be\nshut off by the cloud provider at a moment's notice.\n\nThis is not how we provide discounts. When you spin up an instance it\u2019s yours\nuntil you terminate it. No need to modify your code to deal with unexpected\ndisruptions.\n\n### All the tools to get started\n\nAll of our instances come pre-installed with the latest versions of CUDA,\nJupyter, Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Keras as well as more frameworks, tools, and\nlanguages you can find in our FAQ.\n\nTo get started with Lambda Cloud you can sign up here or, if you\u2019re already a\ncustomer, sign in and launch a new 8-GPU instance at $4.40 / hr from the\ndashboard.\n\n* * *\n\n1. All models are benchmarked with the max batch size under the assumption that the throughput will increase linearly with the batch size. However in practice we found sometimes smaller batch size actually gives higher throughput. For example, reduce batch size = from 88 images / GPU to 32 images / GPU, the training throughput for SSD_AMP increased from 1330 images / sec to 1600 images / sec, which matches our standard bare metal hardware reference. \n\n## Read On\n\n###  V100 server on-prem vs AWS p3 instance cost comparison\n\nDeep Learning requires GPUs, which are very expensive to rent in the cloud.
