By the end of\nthis guide you\u2019ll have a good understanding of GPU cloud options available\ntoday \u2013 especially for machine learning and deep learning applications.  \n  \nWhat\u2019s the best GPU cloud? Are there viable alternatives to the GPU cloud\ninstances offered by AWS, Azure, and GCP? What GPU instances are available\nwith minimal setup and with helpful starters, templates, and guides?  \nWhy does every GPU cloud make it so difficult to determine total cost?  \n  \nIf you\u2019ve got questions like these and others about GPU cloud providers, we\u2019ve\ngot you covered in the Paperspace Guide to GPU Cloud Providers.In this guide\nwe\u2019ll take a look at the various GPU cloud providers offering GPUs on the web\nand talk about availability, performance, price, and general ease of use.  \n  \nLet\u2019s get started!\n\n### Methodology\n\nGPU cloud providers often use different units of measurement with different\nsensible defaults. GPU machine specs can vary wildly from cloud to cloud \u2013\nwith different instance or machine sub-groupings and different pricing\nconventions.  \n  \nOur mission in this guide is to provide a simplified overview of the GPU cloud\nproviders to make it easier to understand what GPU cloud providers are selling\nin comparative terms and what various services offer as part of their GPU\ncloud offerings.  \n  \nFirst we need to understand what we\u2019re talking about:  \n\n  * We want to list GPU cloud instances by the model and spec of the GPU\n  * We are not interested in the cloud provider\u2019s cryptic name for the instance, we are just interested in what the instance comprises\n  * We want to standardize all cloud providers to a single pricing method: price per GPU per unit time\n  * We do not want to know about pre-emptible or interruptible GPUs since we care about production workloads. We only want to focus on GPU resources that are guaranteed\n  * We don\u2019t want to know about fractional GPU machines\n  * We also avoid \u201ctwo-sided marketplace\u201d GPU cloud providers because they are unreliable and unpredictable\n  * We want to know hourly and monthly pricing since most GPU cloud providers will provide price breaks or discounts for long-term or reserved instances\n  * This guide does not take into account the cost of storage, network performance, and ingress/egress. These factors are highly variable from cloud to cloud and for the moment the guide is focused on the GPU computing aspects of these clouds exclusively\n\nLet\u2019s jump into the analysis!\n\n### Paperspace\n\nBest GPU variety\n\nBest GPU cloud providers to get up and running\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for long-term reserved pricing\n\n###### About the product\n\nPaperspace is a Series B cloud infrastructure company based in New York City\nfocused on accelerated computing applications.\n\nWith more than 500,000 users, Paperspace operates data centers across the US\nand Europe.\n\nPaperspace is known for having a wide selection of high-performance GPU\nmachines, especially for machine learning and deep learning applications.\n\nThe company has two key products: Core, which provides GPU-backed VMs in\nWindows and Linux, and Gradient, which provides Notebooks, Workflows, and\nDeployments for machine learning users.\n\nBenefits of Paperspace include a wide selection of machines, very fast start-\nup time, and free GPU options via Gradient. Drawbacks include limitations on\ntypes of free instances.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * A100 80 GB\n  * Quadro M4000\n  * Quadro P4000\n  * Quadro P5000\n  * Quadro P6000\n  * Quadro RTX4000\n  * Quadro RTX5000\n  * RTX A4000\n  * RTX A5000\n  * RTX A6000\n  * V100 16 GB\n  * V100 32 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Widest selection of GPUs\n  * Competitive price per hour\n  * Free GPU options (via Gradient)\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * 10+ GBPS requires custom order\n  * Tough anti-fraud measures\n  * Limited free availability\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### Linode\n\nBest GPU cloud providers to get up and running\n\n###### About the product\n\nLinode, acquired by Akamai in 2022 for $900M, was once one of the pioneers of\nthe cloud computing industry. When Linode launched in 2003, cloud computing\nand cloud infrastructure were just coming into focus as concepts. Linode was\none of the first on the internet to make it really easy to spin-up a server in\nthe cloud for hosting applications.\n\nAt the time of writing, Linode has only a single GPU type. Although a single\nGPU instance type places Linode ahead of scores of general cloud hosting\ncompanies, the lack of instance types is a negative among GPU cloud providers\nas it leaves little room for growth and experimentation.\n\nThat said, compared to the A100 offered by single-GPU-vendor Vultr and the\nV100 offered by single-GPU-vendor OVH, the RTX 6000 offered by Linode is an\nexcellent value play as it is far less expensive with substantial GPU memory.\n\nIt would be a welcome sight for Linode to continue adding more GPU types.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * Quadro RTX 6000\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Decent mid-level GPU offering\n  * Trustworthy reputation\n  * Pretty good value\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Only 1 GPU type\n  * Only configurable up to 4-way \n  * Lack of machine learning tools   \n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### AWS EC2\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for infinite scale\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for long-term reserved pricing\n\n###### About the product\n\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is one of the oldest products in the AWS\nportfolio. At the time of the public beta release in 2006 there were no GPUs\nin the lineup but over the years EC2 has adopted more GPU support in more\nregions, especially with the rise of AWS SageMaker.\n\nCritics have pointed out that EC2 has very few GPU options available given the\nmarket dominance that AWS enjoys in cloud computing generally. But what AWS\nlacks in options and configuration speed, they make up for in pricing power\nand volume discount. EC2 really shines when it comes to top-end 8-way clusters\noperating under reserved contracts of 1-3 years.\n\nIn addition, AWS SageMaker provides a layer on top of EC2 for machine learning\nand deep learning use cases. This includes SageMaker Studio Notebooks and\nother tools.\n\nThat said, AWS is known neither for simplicity nor for ease of use. Like other\nAWS products, it can be extremely time consuming to get up and running on GPU\ninstances via EC2. Since this is the primary tradeoff, AWS is usually best for\nteams brining large-scale GPU computing projects into production.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * A100 80 GB\n  * A10G\n  * M60\n  * T4\n  * V100 16 GB\n  * V100 32 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * GPU machines are part of highly popular EC2 product\n  * Strong discounts for reserved instances\n  * Highly configurable storage, RAM, CPUs, etc.\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Very long time to get setup\n  * Top-end instances are 8-way only\n  * Few GPU options available\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### CoreWeave\n\nBest GPU variety\n\n###### About the product\n\nCoreWeave, founded in 2017, is a New York City company founded by a team from\nthe asset management and cryptocurrency space. The team began its life\nbuilding sophisticated cryptomining operations and parlayed skills learned\nbuilding cost-efficient infrastructure for finance into a GPU cloud computing\nplatform.\n\nToday CoreWeave operates around 8,000 servers across 7 data centers in the US.\nCoreWeave has one of the better GPU catalogs, offering a number of Ampere-\nseries GPUs such as the A100 and RTX A4000, RTX A5000, and RTX A6000.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * A100 80 GB\n  * Quadro RTX4000\n  * Quadro RTX5000\n  * RTX A40\n  * RTX A5000\n  * RTX A6000\n  * V100 16 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Excellent variety of GPUs\n  * Superb multi-GPU configuration options\n  * Competitive prices\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Lack of starter templates or images\n  * Hidden storage and networking costs\n  * Lack of discounts\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### Google Cloud\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for infinite scale\n\n###### About the product\n\nGoogle\u2019s GCP offers six different GPU types which are available to add on to\nnew or existing VMs. Since GCP provides GPU instances as \"add-on\" to regular\nVMs, it makes pricing a little bit complicated as VM costs need to be added to\nGPU costs to achieve a reasonable understanding of costs. On the flip side,\nthe ability to select any of GCP's VMs to attach to GPUs makes the offering\nappealing for those who desire highly configurable instances.\n\nMany users find the Google GCE interface easy to work with compared to other\npublic clouds like AWS.\n\nIn the deep learning world, Google owns and operates Kaggle and Colab, each of\nwhich provide free GPUs in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Since these free\nofferings are extremely popular, Google enjoys the benefits of having a large\naudience of developers who are already accustomed to working with specific\nGPUs -- notably the P4, T4, and P100.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * K80\n  * P100\n  * P4\n  * T4\n  * V100 16 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Google products Kaggle and Colab feature similar GPUs\n  * Large selection of premier deep learning machines (V100 and A100)\n  * Free GPU options (via Kaggle and Colab)\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * GPUs must be attached to standard VMs, making pricing confusing\n  * Few GPU options\n  * Only 1 GPU type with more than 40 GB graphics memory\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### Jarvis Labs\n\nBest GPU cloud provider for beginners\n\nBest GPU cloud providers to get up and running\n\n###### About the product\n\nJarvis Labs is an India-based company founded in 2019 that makes it fast and\neasy to train deep learning models on GPU compute instances.\n\nJarvis Labs operates data centers within India and is known for making it\nextremely easy to get up and running quickly.\n\nJarvis Labs is most popular among data science students, who find the simple\ninterface and access to GPUs helpful. Although the offering is limited when\ntrying to scale, it is perfectly acceptable for data science learning and\nexploration.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * Quadro RTX 5000\n  * Quadro RTX 6000\n  * RTX A5000\n  * RTX A6000\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Extremely simple interface great for beginners\n  * Simple deployment tutorials for Gradio, Streamlit, FastAPI, and Flask\n  * One of the fastest ways to get up and running\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Billing is pre-pay only with a rechargeable wallet/account ledger\n  * Application is basic\n  * Difficult to scale in any way\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### Lambda Labs\n\nBest GPU cloud providers to get up and running\n\nBest GPU cloud provider for beginners\n\n###### About the product\n\nLambda Labs is a scientific computing company that has been assembling and\nshipping GPU desktop and server hardware solutions for over a decade.  \n\nAlthough Lambda Labs offers physical hardware with an exciting number of GPU\ncards and configurations, the Lambda Cloud, which launched in 2018, is limited\nto V100, A100, RTX 6000, and RTX A6000 GPU types.\n\nNevertheless, Lambda Cloud is offering the beginnings of an exciting lineup of\nGPU cards, optimizing for configurations that are well suited for fixed-budget\npurchasers.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * Quadro RTX 6000\n  * RTX A6000\n  * V100 16 GB\n  * A100 40 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Instant quotes for fixed budget purchasers\n  * Simple interface with SSH connection or Jupyter notebook\n  * Simple billing and invoice system\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Limited GPU types\n  * Limited to basic VM or notebook functionality\n  * Limited support for shared storage\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### Microsoft Azure\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for infinite scale\n\nBest GPU variety\n\n###### About the product\n\nMicrosoft Azure has the best selection of GPU instances among the big public\ncloud providers. Azure outcompetes AWS and GCP when it comes to variety of GPU\nofferings although all three are equivalent at the top end with 8-way V100 and\nA100 configurations that are almost identical in price.\n\nOne unexpected place where Azure shines is with pricing transparency for GPU\ncloud instances. Although Azure like AWS EC2 and Google GCP makes it difficult\nto synthesize various GPU offerings by detailing each instance on its own\npage, the end result is that Azure pricing is relatively easy to understand.\n\nAzure is best for production-level GPU computing in which high levels of\nconfiguration and scalability are paid for with extensive setup time. Azure\nhas received plenty of criticism for lack of GPU availability so as with any\nGPU cloud provider it's important to test the claims of what's available\nagainst what actually is available day to day.\n\n\u200d\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * A100 40 GB\n  * A100 80 GB\n  * K80\n  * P100\n  * P40\n  * T4\n  * V100 16 GB\n  * V100 32 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Best variety of GPUs among big public cloud providers\n  * Pricing is straightforward, although occasionally confusing when instances are actually shared GPUs\n  * Linux and Windows offerings\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Like other big clouds, more intended for full-scale production than for scale-up \n  * Several instance types are scheduled for deprecation\n  * Difficult to get help when needed\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### OVH Cloud\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for long-term reserved pricing\n\nBest GPU cloud providers for infinite scale\n\n###### About the product\n\nOVH is a French cloud computing company founded in 1999 and is Europe\u2019s\nlargest hosting provider. Like some other GPU providers on this list, OVH has\na long history of web hosting dating back to the early 2000s and recently has\nbeen dipping its toes into the GPU world.\n\nOVH offers V100 GPUs (both 16 GB and 32 GB flavors) which were, until the rise\nof the A100, the pre-eminent GPU on the market for machine learning and deep\nlearning.\n\nOVH has the beginnings of a solid GPU offering but will need to increase the\nnumber of instance types to compete with its hyperscale cloud computing peers.\n\n###### GPUs available\n\n  * V100 16 GB\n  * V100 32 GB\n\n###### Pros\n\n  * Extremely good pricing\n  * Simple offering \n  * Good for batch processing or long training runs\n\n###### Cons\n\n  * Only offering V100 which lags behind state of the art A100\n  * Impossible to get a single GPU\n  * Few customization options\n\n###### Features\n\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nWindows\n\nSSH\n\nWindows\n\nPublic IP\n\nPublic IP\n\nFree GPUs\n\nFree GPUs\n\nJupyter\n\nJupyter\n\nShared Persistent Storage\n\nJupyter\n\n10+ GBPS\n\n10+ GBPS\n\nAMD Support\n\nAMD Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\nCPU-only Support\n\n### You're in good company.
