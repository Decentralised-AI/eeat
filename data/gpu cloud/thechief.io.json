This makes it important to be available for use\non the cloud for easy accessibility, especially now that companies move from\non-premise infrastructure.\n\nHowever, getting a hold of which cloud providers offer the best GPU service\ncan be difficult, and this article tackles just that.\n\n* * *\n\n  * Latitude.sh\n  * Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n  * Paperspace\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Vast.ai\n  * Oracle Cloud\n  * Microsoft Azure\n  * LeaderGPU\n  * IBM Cloud\n  * Alibaba Cloud\n  * Tencent Cloud\n  * Which GPU Cloud Provider Should I Choose?\n\nWhile most people are familiar with CPUs, GPUs are famous for being a key\ncomponent in providing great graphics in gaming systems and graphics-intensive\nsoftware. In recent times, GPUs are widely adopted in artificial intelligence\nand machine learning to process extensive data used in training machine\nlearning models.\n\nGraphics Processing Unit, GPU, just like CPU, is a silicon-based\nmicroprocessor used to accelerate graphics creation by manipulating and\naltering the memory. Unlike in CPUs, GPUs do their computation in parallel,\nenabling them to do intense computer calculations at once.\n\nThis high computational speed is what is needed to render high-quality\ngraphics like in video games and intensive datapoint processing required in\ndata science and training machine learning models.\n\nIn native IT infrastructures, many organizations use GPUs for their compute-\nintensive applications and workloads. Like in the case of many technology\nstacks, GPU technology is fast-changing, with NVIDIA (one of the biggest GPU\nproviders) releasing a new GPU almost every year. Keeping up with this fast-\nchanging technology is not only tricky but also very expensive.\n\nBut since many organizations are now moving their IT infrastructure to the\ncloud, cloud service providers can continually update their GPU technology and\nmake them available to these companies at a lower cost than on-premise.\n\nThere are quite a several GPU cloud providers, including major cloud service\nproviders. They all offer GPUs of various models, compute power, storage\ncapacity, and price.\n\nLet\u2019s explore some of the best in this article.\n\n## Latitude.sh\n\n>  _The Chief I/O choice._\n\nLatitude.sh is a specialized Bare Metal Cloud Computing platform that offers\nnotable processing power through its last-generation hardware and automation\nas a low-cost alternative to public cloud services.
