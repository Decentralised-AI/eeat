Lambda Labs Cloud :\n\nPhoto by Macrovector / Freepik\n\nAdd speed and simplicity to your Machine Learning workflow today\n\nGet startedContact Sales\n\nDo you need additional computing resources to speed up dense computations and\nconsidering how to utilize cloud GPUs?\n\nAre you unsure of the right platforms to use, or are you weighing your options\nfor better cloud GPU platforms that perfectly suit your budget and are\ncompatible with your business goals and budget?\n\nThen this article is just right for you. In this article, we will examine the\nadvantages and disadvantages of using each platform, so that you can pick out\nthe best platform for your use case.  \n\n## What are GPUs?\n\nTechnology for deep learning, graphics rendering, and other other\ncomputationally heavy domains has improved massively over the years, and with\nthat there has been notable increases in the requirements for the speed,\naccuracy, and resolution of applications. These improvements have relied on\nthe availability of computing resources that are capable of running the\nprocesses that support these applications at scale and over time.\n\nFor instance, modern gaming requires larger storage capacities to accommodate\nextra visual elements. Higher processing speeds are also needed to support the\nincreasingly high-definition visuals and background operations for a better\ngaming experience.\n\nSo simply put, we need higher computing resources to run extensive operations\nrequired to support modern compute-intensive applications.\n\nIn terms of computing speed, the advent of CPUs and further developments in\nprocessor architectures to produce even faster CPUs enable the speed required\nto run most computer operations. But as denser operations needed to be\nprocessed much faster, there was a need for a technology that would unlock\nfaster and more efficient possibilities for such dense computing. This led to\nthe development of GPUs.\n\n **Graphics processing units,** GPUs, are microprocessors that utilize\nparallel processing capabilities and higher memory bandwidth to perform\nspecialized tasks such as accelerating graphics creation and simultaneous\ncomputations. They have become essential for the dense computing required in\nsome applications such as gaming, 3D imaging, video editing, crypto mining,\nand machine learning. It's no secret that GPUs are much faster and more\nefficient in running dense computations for which CPUs are extremely slow.\n\nGPUs are much faster than CPUs for deep learning operations because the\ntraining phase is quite resource-intensive. Such operations require extensive\ndata-point processing due to the numerous convolutional and dense operations.\nThese involve several matrix operations between tensors, weights, and layers\nfor the sort of large-scale input data and deep networks that characterize\ndeep learning projects.\n\nThe ability of GPUs to run these multiple tensor operations faster due to\ntheir numerous cores and accommodate more data due to their higher memory\nbandwidth makes it much more efficient for running deep learning processes\nthan CPUs. A dense operation that takes 50 minutes on a CPU could take about\njust a minute on a low-end GPU.\n\n## Why Use Cloud GPU?\n\nWell, why not?\n\nWhile some users opt to have on-premise GPUs, the popularity of cloud GPUs has\ncontinued to grow within the data science community. Having an on-premise GPU\noften requires upfront expenses and time on custom installations, management,\nmaintenance, and eventual upgrade. In contrast, GPU instances provided by\ncloud platforms simply require the users to utilize the service without the\nneed for any of those technical operations and at affordable service charges.\n\nThese platforms provide all the services required to utilize GPUs for\ncomputing and are responsible for the overall management of the GPU\ninfrastructure.\n\nTaking away the technical processes required to self-manage on-premise GPUs\nallows users to focus on their business speciality. Thereby simplifying\nbusiness operations and improving productivity.\n\nApart from erasing the complexities of managing on-premise GPUs, utilizing\ncloud GPUs saves time and is more cost-effective than investing in and\nmaintaining on-site infrastructures. This benefits smaller businesses as it\nturns the capital expenses required to mount and manage such computing\nresources into the operational cost for using the cloud GPU services, thereby\nlowering their barrier to building deep learning infrastructures.\n\nCloud platforms also provide other perks such as data migration,\naccessibility, integration, storage, security, upgrade, scalability,\ncollaboration, control, and support for stress-free and efficient computing.\n\nLike a chef and their assistants, it would make perfect sense to have someone\nelse provide the necessary ingredients, so you can focus on preparing the\nmeal.\n\n## How do I get started with cloud GPU?\n\nGetting started with cloud GPUs is getting easier as cloud platforms design\nmore user-friendly interfaces for customers.\n\nThe first step to using cloud GPUs would be to choose a cloud platform.\nComparing platforms based on their respective services is important in making\nan informed choice that is compatible with your needs. While I make some\nsuggestions on the best available cloud GPU platforms and instances for your\ndeep learning workloads in this article, feel free to explore other options on\nyour own in finding what works best for your needs.\n\nThe next step after choosing a platform would be to get familiar with its\ninterface and infrastructure. Practice makes perfect in this case. There are\nnumerous documentation, tutorial videos, and blogs for learning how to use\nmost cloud platforms. These serve as a guide for users.\n\nSome other platforms (such as Google, Amazon, IBM, and Azure) provide learning\npaths and certifications for their services for better learning experience and\nutilization.\n\nIf you are an absolute beginner to data science with cloud computing, I\nsuggest you begin with the free, unlimited GPU access available on Gradient\nNotebooks. That will help you get some hands-on experience before moving on to\nmore enterprise platforms.\n\n## How do I choose a suitable platform and plan?\n\nYes, there is a paradox of choice for the right cloud GPU platform to use for\ndiverse personal and business computing. Making a choice could be daunting,\nespecially with the increasingly available cloud platforms and plans.\n\nFor deep learning operations, the choice for a cloud GPU platform should\ndepend on the specifications of its GPU instances, its infrastructure, design,\npricing, availability and customer support. The choice of a particular plan\ndepends on the particular use case, data size, budget and workload.\n\nHere is a list of the best cloud GPU platforms you can utilize for your\npersonal or business needs.\n\n### 10\\.

Feaster\n\nWhen we started Paperspace back in 2014, our mission was to make cloud GPU\nresources more accessible and less expensive for everyone. Since inception, we\nhave continued to offer a wide variety of low-cost GPU instances, often at a\nfraction of the price of other cloud providers.  \n\nToday, we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve taken that mission a step further.\n\n## Introducing our new Free Gradient GPU plan\n\nWe\u2019d like to introduce you to our new way to run GPU-enabled Jupyter Notebooks\nin the cloud\u2014 absolutely free!  \n\nRequest Early Access for the Free Gradient GPU plan\n\n  \n\nYou'll be added to our waitlist. We'll move you up the list for each person\nyou invite with your referral code.\n\nSign Up Today\n\n* * *\n\n### Why Run a Jupyter Notebook on Free GPUs\n\n**Run on free, dedicated cloud GPUs:** Setting up and running a cloud GPU from\nany of the major providers can be a complicated process if you\u2019re not already\nexperienced. And even if you are, not only is setting up an instance an\nunnecessary time sink, the machines available are often prohibitively\nexpensive.\n\nWith Gradient Notebooks, not only do you not have to worry about setting up\nand maintaining your own instance, you can now run your Notebooks on a free,\ndedicated cloud GPU instance.\n\n* * *\n\n### Getting Started with Your First Free GPU Notebook\n\nLaunching your first Gradient Public Notebook is easy: first, **sign up for a\nfree Gradient subscription!** Note: All notebooks in the free tier are set to\npublic by default.\n\nNext, select either the M400 cloud GPU instance (running on NVIDIA Quadro\nM4000) or our high-performance C2 cloud CPU instance (Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae E5-2630\nv3).\n\nClick \"Create Notebook,\" and that\u2019s it!\n\nYou can run a Gradient Public Notebook on one free, dedicated GPU/CPU instance\nat a time, for up to 6 hours. And don\u2019t worry, your Notebook will remain fully\nversioned, and you can restart your instance to run for another 6 hours as\nmany times as you like.\n\nTo run more than one public Notebook instance\u2014 and to get access to private\nNotebooks\u2014 simply upgrade to one of our pay-per-second cloud instances.\n\n* * *\n\n### Sign up for access to the Free Gradient GPU plan\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to helping you share your ML and deep learning models\nwith the world.
