Vendor lock-in\nfurther entrenches higher pricing once you select a single vendor. VAST\u2019s\nsearch interface allows for fair comparison from all kinds of providers, from\nhobbyists to Tier 4 data centers. Start saving 4-6X today and get setup on a\nsingle interface that connects you to a VAST marketplace.\n\n## Tapping the vast power of Decentralized Compute\n\nToday most of the world's general compute power consists of GPUs used for\ncryptocurrency mining or gaming. Due to new ASICs and other shifts in the\necosystem causing declining profits these GPUs need new uses. Vast simplifies\nthe process of renting out machines, allowing anyone to become a cloud compute\nprovider resulting in much lower prices.\n\n## Choose Your Security Level\n\nVast gives you control over the level of security you require for your tasks.\nFrom lower-cost hobbyist providers with consumer GPUs up to Tier 4 data\ncenters with enterprise GPUs, Vast.ai lets you choose providers to meet your\nsecurity needs.\n\n## Democratizing AI\n\nMachine learning is progressing towards powerful AI with the potential to\nradically reshape the future. We believe it is imperative that this awesome\npower be distributed widely; that its benefits accrue to the many rather than\nthe few; that its secrets are unlocked for the good of all humanity. Towards\nthese ends we work to ensure that the compute powering AI is supplied by the\npeople and for the people.\n\n  * Solutions\n  * Hosting\n  * Console\n\n  * Resources\n  * Docs\n  * Pricing\n  * Careers\n  * FAQ\n\n  * Community\n  * GitHub\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n\n  * Legal\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Data Processing\n\n  * Contact\n  * Get in Touch\n  * All the answers you need in 24h or less.\n\n",

We're excited to announce a new feature, Reserved Instance\nDiscounts, designed to help you get more out of your budget.\n\n## Motivation #\n\nWith on-demand instances users pay only for the time they use and can end a\ncontract at any time. This results in an overall occupancy (fraction of time\nGPUs are rented) of less than 100%, often around 50% - and corresponding\nreduction in provider revenue.\n\nThe on demand rental contract is thus suboptimal for users who have\npredictable long term compute needs and are willing to commit up front to a\nlonger rental term. Reserved instance discounts allow clients to commit to a\nlonger term rental contract by pre-paying in advance, giving up the on demand\nliquidity in exchange for a discount. Clients can benefit from discounted\nprices up to 50% or more, and providers can benefit from guaranteed occupancy\nup to 100%.\n\n## How They Work #\n\nUsers can deposit credits into a specific on demand instance using the GUI or\nCLI to convert it into a reserved instance with a lower price. The CLI allows\nfine grained control of deposit amounts, while the GUI presents a convenient\ninterface allowing users to select a committment duration (1 month, 3 month or\n6 months) from which the deposit size and discount is automatically\ncalculated.\n\nThe specific discount schedule is a function of the time duration of the\nbalance: larger deposits unlock greater discounts (but with diminishing\nreturns). The default discount schedule is 20% discount for 1 month, 30% for 3\nmonths, and 40% for 6 months. As an example, for an instance which normally\ncosts $1/hr on demand, a 1 month pre-paid rental with default discount\nschedule would cost $576 instead of the on-demand price of $720 for the month.\n\nDepositing additional funds into an existing reserved instance recalculates\neverything according to the new total balance, resulting in a new discount\nrate.\n\nThe specific discount schedule can vary from provider to provider - 40% at 6\nmonths is the default setting.\n\n## Depositing Credits into an Instance #\n\n  1. Add credits to your account (if needed)\n\n  2. Navigate to the instances page\n\n  3. On the bottom right of the instance will be a green icon, click it to open the reserved instance pre-pay options\n\n  4. Choose the option of your preference. In the UI, the discount options are streamlined to several whole month options. Using the CLI you can deposit as many credits as you want into an instance towards a discount.\n\n  5. Click Next\n\n  6. Agree to The Deposit Amount\n\n## Extending a Reserved Instance #\n\nYou can extend a reserved instance via the CLI, or via the website doing the\nsame flow as depositing credits into an instance. You have more options in the\nCLI since you can deposit any amount of credits. The discount scales based on\nthe size of the reserved deposit balance, as described above.\n\nEvery time you add credits, the discount percentage will be re-calculated.\nDont fall into the trap of giving yourself a worse deal by adding small\namounts of credits. EG: If you buy a 3 month discount, wait 2 months and 14\ndays to buy 2 weeks worth of credit, you will have the discount recalculated\nat a lower rate.\n\n## Refunds #\n\nYou can destroy a reserved instance to refund a portion of any remaining\nreserved deposit balance. The refunded amount is equal to the remaining\nreserve deposit less a penalty equal to the total discount so far.\n\nFor example consider an instance with an on demand price of $1/hr or\n$720/month where the user deposited a 1 month reservation for a reserved price\nof $576. If the user deletes the instance right away, they get back the full\n$576. If they wait a month, they get back $0. If the user destroys the\ninstance about half way through the month when they have a remaining deposit\nof $288, they will get back $216 ($288 - 0.5*(720-576)).\n\n.\n\n"
