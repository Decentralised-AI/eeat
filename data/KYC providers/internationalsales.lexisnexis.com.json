It may be that not all of your business\npartners are behaving as you suppose. A glance behind the fa\u00e7ade can uncover\nunexpected risks \u2013 for your company and for you personally. You should\ntherefore run a KYC check on your suppliers and customer onboarding and on an\nongoing basis to reveal any concealed financial crimes and non-compliance.\n\nFind out how to go about it in our due diligence checklist.\n\n## **Definition: What is Know Your Customer (KYC)?**\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) is the aspect of due diligence that deals with the\nidentity verification of customers. KYC procedures involves checking personal\nand business details in order to exclude negative hits such as sanctions\nlists, watch lists and PEP lists and to identify ownership relationships,\ninvolvement in anti-money laundering and links between companies. To help\ntackle financial crime, money laundering, terrorist financing and other\ncriminal activities, minimum standards for due diligence, risk and compliance\nchecks have been introduced. The legal basis for the due diligence that makes\na KYC analysis necessary is the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive. Failure to\ncomply with the due diligence requirement can result in heavy fines,\nreputational damage or even a prison sentence and withdrawal of your business\npermit.\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Supplier (KYS) checks should therefore\nbe a fixed component of your compliance management system (CMS). The nature\nand depth of the regulatory risk and compliance check depend on the expected\nlevel of risk. Transactions are also screened to identify possible unusual\nactivities.\n\nOne of the aims of Know-Your-Business-Partner due diligence is therefore to\nreveal the origin and whereabouts of funds. Risky activities that render such\nchecks necessary include:\n\nitem icon\n\nMoney Laundering\n\nitem icon\n\nFraud\n\nitem icon\n\nTax evasion\n\nitem icon\n\nTerrorism financing\n\n## **Customer Due Diligence**\n\nCustomer Due Diligence or CDD is the technique of acquiring, assessing, or\nverifying a customer or potential customer's identity and background\ninformation through the customer's name, photograph, residential address, and\nso on. Customer Due Diligence is a critical component of achieving Know Your\nCustomer (KYC) compliance. It is generally conducted by financial\norganizations to uncover any potential risks of doing business with a certain\ncustomer or firm by analyzing data from a range of sources, including\ngovernment-published sanctions lists, company listings, third-party data\nsources, and so on. The list of data or information needed to be collected\nare:\n\n  * The identity of the customers.\n  * The activities the customer is engaged in.\n  * The markets in which the customers operate and other entities in which they have a business.\n  * The risk profile of the customer \u2013 how likely they are to engage in behaviors that put financial institutions at risk.\n\nFinancial organizations devote time and energy to conducting customer due\ndiligence to avoid money laundering, fraud, terrorist financing, and\nsanctions-busting using the best due diligence software. Depending upon the\ncustomer's risk profile, we, at LexisNexis, conduct different levels of\ncustomer risk due diligence.\n\n## **Preventing Economic Crime**\n\nA robust Know-Your-Customer program helps companies avoid becoming embroiled\nin economic crime and provide security. Money laundering, corruption and fraud\nare issues that can affect any company and financial institutions, either\ndirectly or indirectly. Businesses must therefore ensure that they put\neffective anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-bribery & corruption (ABC)\nmeasures in place.\n\nFailure to do so can result in fines and prison sentences. Affected companies\noften suffer reputational damage. In serious cases, business permits may be\nwithdrawn.\n\nA KYC check is therefore no longer just something for companies in the\nfinancial sector: organizations in all sectors need to take them seriously.\n\nClient due diligence must be particularly thorough if it involves people who\nhave links with politicians or government bodies, because politically exposed\npersons (PEPs) are particularly vulnerable to corruption and bribery.\n\nSmall customers can be excluded from customer due diligence (also: client due\ndiligence) if contract values are low and their business situation is not\nunusual.\n\nWith a professional KYC tool/risk and compliance check tool/due diligence\nsoftware, companies can make investment to uncover the necessary background\ninformation on companies and individuals. The access to valid databases via a\nsingle platform simplifies research and reveals the relevant information\nquickly.\n\n## **Legal Principles**\n\nThe legal basis for KYC checks is the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive. This,\ncombined with the UK Bribery Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act and the Financial\nAction Task Force (FATF), provides the framework for Know-Your-Customer\nactivities.\n\n###  **Legal principles internationally**\n\nThe international regulations are relevant event to companies that are not\nlocated in the affected countries but have business links with them.\n\nKnow-Your-Customer software helps you uncover criminal activity by companies\nand individuals. For example, it enables you to identify dummy companies that\nare being used by beneficial owners for money laundering or tax evasion.\n\nUsing a risk-based regulatory approach, you need to decide what resources to\ninvest in a KYC check.\n\nDo not rely on your partners\u2019 good reputation but uncover risky activities\nusing risk and compliance check tool or third party compliance risk management\nand due diligence software: Know your customer!\n\n## **Who should use Know Your Customers (KYC)**\n\nAll companies require KYC process that have business relations with Financial\nInstitutions, Banks, Companies handling sensitive data, International Vendors,\nSuppliers and of course Customers. It is important for companies to run KYC\nduring onboarding and signing of contracts as well as ongoing basis or at the\ntime of renewal of contract to avoid association with business partners\ninvolved in financial crimes, and non-compliance of rules and regulations.\n\n## **You might also be interested in**\n\nAbout the Solution\n\nKYC compliance\n\nScreening business partners with Nexis Diligence+\u2122\n\nTo the webinar overview\n\nWebinars\n\nLearn more in our free compliance webinars.\n\nView the blog\n\nCompliance Blog\n\nExpert contributions to current challenges.\n\n### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nAnswers to some popular questions\n\n__ What is KYC ?\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) is the aspect of due diligence that deals with the\nprecise identification and Verify customers.
