Cut through all the speculative\ntalk and the hyperbolic language and you\u2019ll find some positive statistics that\nring loud and true, especially when it comes to improving the merchant\nunderwriting and onboarding processes for businesses in the payments industry.\n\nAutomated underwriting software solutions like the ones offered by Agreement\nExpress are lauded for causing some pretty remarkable improvements in business\nprocesses; using our software, underwriters have been able to see their\napplication volumes swell by 10 times their normal amount, and companies have\nseen a 70% reduction in abandonment rates because of how smooth and quick the\nprocess becomes. The cherry on top is the 30% reduction in NiGO rates, further\nimproving overall experience for both underwriters and clients.\n\n## What Does this Shift Mean for the Payments Industry?\n\nAutomation is truly becoming the gold standard in essentially every industry,\nand the best way to go about implementing automation into business procedures\nis to buy existing software that is easy to implement and simple to learn.\nSome companies attempt to build software specifically for a need or process,\nwhich often leads to a static solution that needs continual development and\nemployee labor to keep it up. Rather than funneling resources and time into\nbuilding new software, consider buying software that has been developed for\ndynamic and scalable use to take the weight of updating and revising off of\nyour business and onto the experts. This allows you to take advantage of\nautomation without technical difficulties.\n\nThe benefits of automation to the payments industry specifically are\nsynergistic in nature. When certain processes like underwriting and onboarding\nimplement automation, the human factor is not thrown out altogether. Rather,\nthe strong suits of automated underwriting software complement the skills of\nthe human eye. Software calculates numbers and parses through data faster and\nmore accurately than any human, and humans have the capability to use multi-\nfactorial thinking in order to make executive decisions, the likes of which\nmachines cannot attempt (yet). Automation grants underwriters more time to\nthink strategically about their processes and ensure that it is running\noptimally, while giving them peace of mind that their data is correct.\n\nThus, there are more doors open than ever in the payments industry; processes\nthat typically hold back payment entities are being met with innovative,\nintelligent, automated solutions, which unleashes the true potential of\npayments businesses. Implementing automated underwriting systems means a\ndecrease in data error and an increase in speed because of fast and accurate\ndata gathering and interpretation. Plus, the more data processed by automated\nunderwriting software, the \u201csmarter\u201d the software becomes, able to identify\nrisk patterns and potential fraud identifiers with ever-increasing precision.\n\n## Merchant Software: Automated Underwriting System\n\nOverall, there\u2019s a lot to take in when learning about how exactly automated\nunderwriting software can work for payments companies. But what are the actual\nbenefits of automated merchant software?\n\nFirst of all, as touched on slightly above, this software automates tasks that\nunderwriters would have to spend time completing. Instead, automating things\nas simple as data entry and NiGO checks can save a massive amount of time,\nmeaning fewer employees can take on more clients and spend more time on bigger\nand more complex tasks instead of drowning in the minutiae of underwriting.\n\nSecondly, companies that use merchant software end up taking on more and\nhappier merchants because of the reduction in friction and faster turnaround\ntimes for approval or denial. Automated risk thresholds can automatically deny\na merchant that does not meet basic qualifications of approval, and allow\nunderwriters to spend more time on qualified candidates, getting their\napproval to them faster.\n\nFurthermore, leveraging merchant software solutions result in less error in\ndata entry because of automated data copying and integration. For example,\nAgreement Express\u2019s software automatically imports data from existing\ndocuments and does automatic checks to make sure all data matches across all\ndocuments. This significantly reduces both the amount of time underwriters\nhave to spend entering data, and the time they spend checking to make sure\ndocuments are NIGO-compliant. Investing in the future of a company by\npurchasing innovative software like Agreement Express that integrates with\nyour existing CRM and tech stack means that you\u2019re adding more tools to your\ntool kit.\n\nFinally, merchant software is incredibly adaptable when developed by experts\nin both the payments and software industries. Agreement Express\u2019s merchant\nsoftware updates to stay constantly compliant and is completely scalable to\nmeet the size of your business and the types of your merchants.\n\n## Are there Downsides to an Automated Underwriting System?\n\nIt is a commonly held belief that a business shift towards automation would\ncause an increase in risk, but that could not be further from the truth. In\nfact, there are companies, such as Schlitz Beer, that have been forced to\nautomate in order to survive.\n\nLong is the list of companies that have completely vanished because they have\nneglected to seize the technology of the day and age. While it\u2019s one thing to\nbe cautious about implementing new solutions without any proof of efficacy,\nit\u2019s another to ignore the clear benefits and hardened numbers of implementing\ntechnology for a process that has room for improvement, like merchant\nunderwriting and onboarding.\n\nThe very human \u201cgut feeling\u201d that heavily influences underwriting decisions is\nanother hesitation held by those wary of automation. Without automation, many\nunderwriting decisions are typically made based on intuition. Merchant\nsoftware like Agreement Express\u2019s tools allows data to have a stronger\ninfluence on the final decision to approve or deny, leading to a more informed\noutcome due to combining automation and human decision-making.\n\n## Merchant Software Conclusion\n\nWith good, effective technology comes a single, up-front cost that pales in\ncomparison to the amount of returns companies see from adapting to a changing\nbusiness landscape. Calculate how much you could be making with Agreement\nExpress with our free ROI calculator.\n\nSo is merchant software a cost center? No, it\u2019s a long-term revenue generator\nthat will put your business at the forefront of the payments industry.\n\nSign up for a demo of Agreement Express\u2019s software to get ahead in this\nautomated underwriting revolution.\n\n## Posts navigation\n\n< Reorganize Your Strategy with a BNPL Payment Solution\n\nWhat Encompasses the Merchant Experience? >\n\n#####  What We Do\n\n  * Payments\n\n    * MonitorX\n  * IRIS CRM Integration\n  * Wealth Management\n\n\u00d7\n\n  * Payments\n\n    * MonitorX\n  * IRIS CRM Integration\n  * Wealth Management\n\n#####  Who We Are\n\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n\n\u00d7\n\n  * About Us\n  * Careers\n\n#####  Resources\n\n  * Resources Hub\n  * ROI Calculator\n  * Blog\n\n\u00d7\n\n  * Resources Hub\n  * ROI Calculator\n  * Blog\n\n#####  Get in Touch\n\n  * Become a Partner\n  * Book a Demo\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00d7\n\n  * Become a Partner\n  * Book a Demo\n  * Contact Us\n\n#####  Support\n\n  * Login\n  * Submit a Ticket\n  * Support Portal\n\n\u00d7\n\n  * Login\n  * Submit a Ticket\n  * Support Portal\n\n__ LinkedIn Social __ Youtube Social __ Twitter Social\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\u00a9 2023 Agreement Express.
