As banks strive towards decreasing\ncustomer onboarding times, achieving perpetual KYC and enabling more efficient\nAML checks, they are realizing the potential that APIs can play in reaching\nthese goals. We have listed some of the ways we believe APIs are helping to\nrevolutionize KYC and AML.\n\n### Accelerating onboarding / reducing time to revenue\n\nWe have written before about one of the biggest friction points in business\nbanking \u2013 the lengthy onboarding times for new customers. Oliver Wyman\nreported that it takes 90-120 days to onboard corporate banking customers, and\nin 2019, it was deduced that the global commercial and business banking market\nlost $3.3 trillion because of abandoned applications during onboarding.\n\nAPIs can accelerate onboarding for business banking by supplying an aggregated\nand normalized data feed of the best global KYC data, helping to build a more\ncomplete risk profile for new customers. Data APIs can work in tandem with\nother processes such as identity verification and onboarding platforms,\nhelping to plug company data gaps such as UBO, shareholder or directorship\ninformation.\n\n### Replacing monolithic compliance infrastructures\n\nMany financial institutions are swamped with a myriad of different systems.\nOften unconnected and specialist point solutions that have a narrow purpose,\nthese fragmented systems add to the daily burden KYC teams face, especially in\nenterprise business environments.\n\nAPIs offer huge benefits by connecting valuable systems together and\nstreamlining the connections between applications, users and server-side\nsystems. In the world of KYC and AML, many banks use a client lifecycle\nmanagement system (CLM) as the backbone of their operations. The more services\nand connections they can integrate into that ecosystem and away from the\nlegacy, monolith systems or disparate point solutions, the more efficient\ntheir KYC teams will become.\n\n### Helping to build a single customer view\n\nFurther to banks suffering with disparate systems, with KYC data living in\nsilos and departments not sharing data, comes the challenge of obtaining a\nsingle, comprehensive view of a customer. Banks are effectively juggling\nmultiple systems to view customer data, transaction data and point-solutions\nto monitor sanctions, PEPs and adverse media.\n\nAPIs can help to bring all of these datasets together and feed them into one\nconsolidated customer view, so that KYC and AML teams can assign risk profiles\nand monitor for changes in real time.\n\n### Increasing data sharing\n\nThe problem of limited information sharing between KYC and AML departments is\nstill prevalent at large banks. Last year, industry expert Dev Odedra shared\nin our webinar a real-world example of a terrorist who was identified by a\nbank, but sufficient KYC information stored on the subject was not discovered\nuntil a later AML investigation.\n\nAPIs can help increase data sharing and re-use for different departments\nwithin a bank, by connecting existing systems such as CLMs with better KYC and\nAML data.\n\n### Increasing automation / reducing manual tasks\n\nAlthough many banks have made huge strides in digitizing paper-based processes\nas part of wider digital transformation initiatives, they are still burdened\nwith manual and laborious tasks. In AML in particular, teams spend inordinate\namounts of time wading through false positive results, as well as having to\nmake sense of unstructured data.\n\nAPIs can offer a path toward automating many manual processes in KYC and AML.\nOne example is using RPA to assist KYC operatives by allowing access data\nwherever it is found, either from premium data providers (behind paywalls) or\nvia scanned documents supplied by customers. Machine learning can even learn\nto find frequently sourced fields across different documents, such as company\nregistration details.\n\n### Productization\n\nThe financial services industry has been challenged by the \u2018build vs buy\u2019\nconundrum for some time. Many internal IT projects have led to failure and an\nexplosion of fintech solutions offer a cheaper way to buy technology. However,\nthere is also a middle ground where banks in particular have succeeded with a\n\u2018build and buy\u2019 strategy.\n\nAPIs are the building blocks for developers to build their own custom\nsolutions. For example, KYC and AML data APIs are the ideal way to supercharge\nan onboarding solution if the goal is to verify company information or to\ncomplete a risk profile. But it is not just about data; if a platform has been\nbuilt on an API-first approach, then much of the functionality should also be\nprogrammatically available, such as monitoring alerts, searching or uploading\nevidence for an AML investigation.\n\n### Better partnerships\n\nWe have already mentioned banks having to juggle multiple, disparate systems\nacross their compliance ecosystem. But as well as the technology, there are\nalso the managed services consultancies who assist banks through challenging\ntimes, such as remediation backlogs or other operational bottlenecks.\n\nAPIs offer a tactical blend of people and technology to accelerate managed\nservices and KYC remediation for financial institutions and other high risk\nindustries. KYC and AML data feeds can supercharge technology for managed\nservices (new or existing) systems, forming a powerful partnership between the\nAPI vendor and the consultants who have long and trusted relationships with\nbanks. Partnerships offer valuable benefits that can weave solutions together\nand also consolidate the number of suppliers that banks have to deal with.\n\n#### Download the guide\n\n**5 considerations when selecting a KYC or AML API**\n\n_We\u2019ve put together a handy guide to help you navigate towards a faster and\nmore efficient world, by asking the right questions before buying._\n\n**Download the PDF from this page**.\n\n  *   * Share\n  * \n\n### Leave a Comment\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail*\n\nWebsite\n\nComment*\n\nReimagining  \nCompliance\n\n#####\n\n  * Resource Center\n  * Case Studies\n  * Careers\n  * Contact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n#####\n\n\n\n_Facebook_ _Twitter_ _LinkedIn_\n\n\u00a9 2023 AML RightSource.
