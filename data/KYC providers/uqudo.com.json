Check our Verification Supported Countries page\nfor a full breakdown of supported countries and core capabilities.\n\n#### What languages do you support?\n\nWe support a total of 98 languages including English, Arabic, and Latin.\n\n###  Products\n\n#### What is KYC?\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) is an identity verification process that\nauthenticates the real identity of customers during onboarding.\n\n#### What is Enhanced Due Diligence?\n\nEDD goes beyond CDD and looks to establish a higher level of identity\nassurance with additional verification steps such as verifying the customer\u2019s\naddress.\n\n#### How do you perform KYC?\n\nThree key steps are involved in our identity process; first, we read the\ndocument and extract identity data; next, we check the person on camera is\nreal and matches the document; finally, we verify document authenticity via\ngovernment databases or using the digital signatures on the document.\n\n#### What are the requirements for KYC?\n\nKYC document requirements vary according to a region\u2019s jurisdiction but\ngenerally include\n\n  * A government-issued ID card\n  * Passport\n  * Driving License\n  * Voter\u2019s ID\n  * Birth certificates\n\n#### Why is KYC required?\n\nKYC helps financial institutions verify the identity of customers and prevents\ncompanies from being used in illegal financial activities. KYC also helps\nfirms understand their customer\u2019s financial behaviour, aiding in a better user\nexperience.\n\n#### What is eKYC?\n\neKYC or Digital KYC refers to a remote, paperless KYC process, that can be\ncompleted digitally. The steps involved in eKYC are:\n\n  * AI document scanning\n  * Biometric face recognition\n  * Digital document verification\n\n#### How long does KYC verification take?\n\nuqudo\u2019s identity verification can be completed in less than 10 seconds.\n\n#### What does your Screening process involve?\n\nuqudo\u2019s screening process involves running background checks by checking\nglobal lists for high-risk entities. In regulated industries, there is a\nrequirement to ensure the individuals you are dealing with aren\u2019t sanctioned\nto mitigate business risk.\n\n  1. Anti Money Laundering (AML) is a set of policies, procedures, and technologies that prevents money laundering. Money laundering involves the execution of transactions to eventually convert illegally obtained money into legal money.\n  2. A Politically Exposed Person (PEP) check, also known as PEP sanction screening, involves searching official politically exposed people lists to see if a prospective or current customer is on that list during client identification or transaction screening processes.\n  3. Sanctions checks (sometimes known as watchlist checks) are specialised searches that include several international, government, or regulator sanctions databases that identify individuals prohibited from certain activities or industries.\n\n#### How do you do AML/PEP\u2019s/Sanctions screening?\n\nOur Screening lists include the following:\n\n  1. Monitored Lists: 900+ monitored lists that include international sanctions, money laundering and other global lists.\n  2. PEPs (Politically Exposed Person) lists: PEP list check against 1.7+ million high-risk individuals.\n  3. Adverse Media Screening: Screening against 3 billion media articles.\n\nWe can screen and monitor in real-time, on an ongoing basis.\n\n#### What is AML?\n\nAML (Anti-Money Laundering) refers to the rules and regulations that combat\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing. AML screening helps detect and\nidentify these suspicious activities.\n\n#### What are monitored lists?\n\nMonitored lists use data from numerous sources to evaluate a customer\u2019s risk\nprofile. Some examples of monitored lists include\n\n  * International sanction lists (FATF, OFAC, UNSC)\n  * Regional sanction lists (MENAFATF, EU, GIABA, ESAAMLG)\n  * Money laundering \n  * Terrorist financing\n  * Drug trafficking\n  * Narcotics trafficking \n  * Human rights violations\n  * International treaties violations\n\n#### What is PEP screening?\n\nPEPs (Politically Exposed Persons) are those individuals holding a prominent\npublic position, which increases their susceptibility to fraud. PEP screening\ninvolves identifying PEPs and evaluating their risk profiles.\n\nOur PEP screening involves evaluation against 4 PEPs risk levels, which are:\n\n  1. High-risk PEPs\n  2. Medium-risk PEPs\n  3. Low-risk PEPs\n  4. PEPs by association\n\n#### Why is watchlist screening important?\n\nA global watchlist screening helps companies identify suspicious money\nlaunderers and individuals associated with financial crimes. Along with this,\nscreening helps firms comply with their region\u2019s AML/CFT regulations.\n\n#### Are uqudo\u2019s Screening lists regularly updated?\n\nYes, our database undergoes real-time updates, so our Ongoing AML can easily\ntrack changes in a customer\u2019s risk profile.  \n\n#### What is KYB?\n\nKnow Your Business (KYB) refers to the controls that a company must implement\nto ensure its clients are not engaged in criminal activity. It is the process\nof due diligence that should be undertaken before dealing with any\norganisation.\n\n#### What is the difference between KYC and KYB?\n\nKYC (Know Your Customer) refers to verifying the identity of an individual,\nwhereas KYB (Know Your Business) analyses and verifies the identity of\ncompanies.\n\n#### Why is KYB necessary?\n\nKYB helps companies obtain essential information about their potential\nclients, to protect their interests while dealing with other businesses. It\nalso ensures that organisations are not indirectly associated with fraudulent\nactivities.\n\nThe main advantages of a comprehensive KYB Screening procedure are:\n\n  1. Helps evaluate the business authenticities of companies, and identify changes in transactional behavior, which sometimes indicate fraud.\n  2. Identifies the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) and evaluates their risk profiles.\n  3. Screening key stakeholders prevent the occurrence of financial fraud making companies trustworthy.\n\n#### Who are UBOs?\n\nA UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) is the ultimate business owner of an\norganisation. A UBO can be classified as someone\n\n  * who owns more than 25% of the company\u2019s shares.\n  * who controls more than 25% of the voting rights.\n  * who is a beneficiary of at least 25% of the organisation\u2019s capital.\n  * who is a shareholder, including those with bearer shares that can be transferred anonymously.\n\n#### Can uqudo verify KYB documents in languages other than English?\n\nYes, uqudo\u2019s KYB coverage includes more than 98 languages, including Arabic,\nEnglish, Afrikaans and many more.\n\n#### What is Biometric Authentication?\n\nEvery individual is unique. As technology progresses, we can use aspects of\nuniqueness to authenticate a person\u2019s identity. Everything from the face,\nfingerprint, palm, and voice can be used to verify a person is who they say\nthey are. Given most ID documents are photo IDs, the face is the most common\nand popular way to authenticate with biometrics.\n\n#### How can biometric authentication help my company?\n\nBiometric authentication provides the opportunity for passwordless logins for\nyour users. Logging in with the face is both faster and more secure. Strong\nauthentication refers to the set of specifications laid out by FIDO. These\nspecifications mean authentication is intrinsically stringent enough to ensure\nthe security of the system it protects.\n\n#### Is facial recognition safe?\n\nBiometric face authentication uses unique facial patterns to identify people,\nmaking it highly efficient. Since our platform doesn\u2019t store data, all\nbiometric information is encrypted and secure.\n\n#### What all biometric authentication methods can be used?\n\nUqudo lets your customers use the following biometrics for authentication:\n\n  * Face\n  * Fingerprint\n  * Voice\n  * Iris\n  * Palm\n\n#### How does 2FA work?\n\nOur two-factor authentication (2FA) uses facial biometrics as the second\nfactor to provide a non-invasive second layer of authentication, to keep your\ncustomer data secure.\n\n#### Which documents do you support?\n\nuqudo\u2019s AI Document Scanning can read and extract identity data from 98% of\ncommonly used identity documents in EMEA. Check out our Coverage &\nCapabilities for a full breakdown of supported documents filtered by\ngeography.\n\n#### Which documents can you verify?\n\nWe can read all passports with an NFC chip and verify passports in 86\ncountries. In addition to this, we are able to verify identity cards in a\ntotal of 11 countries currently. For a full list of the documents that we are\nable to verify visit our Coverage & Capabilities page.\n\n##### Secure, frictionless,  \n& fully compliant digital onboarding.  \nIntegrated seamlessly within your app.\n\nBook a demo 30 min intro call\n\n###  Features\n\n#### What are the hardware and software requirements of the SDKs?\n\nuqudo\u2019s SDK is supported on both iOS (version 9.0 and above) and Android\n(version 6.0 and above). The NFC feature requires a phone with an NFC\ninterface.\n\n#### How do you ensure the data from the NFC chip are genuine?\n\nWe support active and passive authentication.\n\n  * **Passive authentication** is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip (attributes, face image, etc.) and a digital signature of these hashes. We have the public certificates in our backend. \n  * **Active Authentication** prevents the cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied. Our backend creates a random value, sends it to the chip for signing and verifies the signature. In that way, we are sure the original card is present at the time of onboarding.\n\n#### How are expired documents handled?\n\nThere are 2 options which can be configured when initializing the SDK:\n\n  * Option 1: The user gets a notification that the document is expired. The SDK only continues with a document that is not expired.\n  * Option 2: The user can onboard the expired document. Your app or your backend can check in the expiry date is in the past.\n\n#### What data is extracted from an identity document, and how does it vary\naccording to different countries?\n\nuqudo\u2019s platform extracts identity data as per a country\u2019s regulatory\nrequirements. For additional customisation, get in touch with our team.\n\n###  Technology\n\n#### Can uqudo be integrated into my website or app?\n\nuqudo is a fully customisable white-label solution that integrates seamlessly\nwithin your website and application via SDK.  \n\n#### How long does integration take?\n\nuqudo integration is simple and can be completed in a matter of days.

Our solution can be SaaS or on-premise deployment.\n\n#### Do you have a testing environment?\n\nYes. You can access a sandbox account to test the product and its\nintegrations.\n\n#### Is the uqudo API usable without the uqudo SDK?\n\nUqudo can provide an API that supports the following features:\n\n  * Convert pictures of IDs into machine-encoded text (OCR).\n  * Perform validations (e.g. verification of checksums, matching ID data with the MRZ).\n  * Access to 3rd party databases for KYC/AML checks.\n\nHowever, there are many features that require the uqudo SDK:\n\n  * Animated instructions and help pages to guide users through the onboarding process.\n  * Ensure the phone is in a secure state (e.g. phone is not rooted).\n  * Automatic scanning of IDs (without a shutter button).\n  * Assurance that the picture can be processed by our OCR engine (e.g. avoid blurring, reflections).\n  * Reading NFC chips embedded inside IDs.\n  * Passive authentication by verifying digital signatures.\n  * Active authentication to ensure the ID was present at the time of onboarding.\n  * Taking a selfie for face authentication automatically (without a shutter button).\n  * Assurance that the lighting conditions and the quality of the selfie are sufficient for face authentication.\n  * Matching between the face image extracted from the ID with the selfie.\n  * Liveness detection during face authentication.\n\n##### Easily integrate  with your tech stack.\n\nSee documentation\n\n###  Compliance\n\n#### Can you help me comply with my regulator's AML laws?\n\nYes. Our global screening capabilities provide the answers you need to meet\nyour compliance requirements. **  \n**\n\n#### Do you sell user data?\n\nNo, we do not. Your privacy is our number one priority.\n\n#### Will previously completed and failed verifications be stored?\n\nBy default, we do not store previously completed and stored verifications.\nHowever, if required, you can opt-in that we store this information at an\nadditional cost. **  \n**\n\n#### Who has access to my data?\n\nOnly you have access to your data.\n\n###  Pricing\n\n#### Why do our clients love our pricing model?\n\nOur pricing model is success based, which means\n\n  * You only pay for customers you have successfully onboarded onto your platform. \n  * There\u2019s no charge for unsuccessful attempt requests.\n  * There\u2019s no charge for additional documents.\n\nuqudo\u2019s pricing model reduces your average cost per user onboarding, letting\nyou control your acquisition costs.\n\n#### How exactly does your pricing model work?\n\nOur pricing is fully customisable, according to your requirements.
