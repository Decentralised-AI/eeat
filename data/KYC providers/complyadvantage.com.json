Despite trying tool after tool, Charles\ncame across the same problems: they were difficult to integrate, hard-to-use,\nand provided too many \u2018false-positive alerts.\n\nLegacy solutions rely on manual labor to create and maintain data, limiting\nupdate frequency. Data can rapidly become obsolete, resulting in more false\npositives and increased exposure to risk.\n\nBy distracting compliance professionals from stopping financial crime, false\npositives facilitate human trafficking and terrorism. The need to equip\ncompliance professionals with effective financial crime-fighting tools led\nCharles to found ComplyAdvantage in 2014.\n\n### 1000+\n\nCompanies\n\n### 200+\n\nCountries and territories covered\n\n### 50%\n\nreduction in onboarding cycle time\n\n### 70%\n\nfalse positive reduction\n\n## Latest news and press releases\n\nBest Transaction Monitoring Software: 6 Companies Compared\n\n##### 30 October 2023\n\nAustralian Authorities Dismantle International Money Laundering Syndicate\n\n##### 27 October 2023\n\nFinCEN Issues Terrorist Financing Red Flags Following Hamas Attacks\n\n##### 27 October 2023\n\nSee all news __\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n  * EN __\n\n    * FR\n\n  * Sanctions & Watchlists Screening\n  * Adverse Media Screening\n  * Know Your Business (KYB)\n  * Transaction Monitoring\n  * Fraud Detection\n  * Payment Screening\n  * ComplyLaunch\u2122\n  * ComplyTry\n  * AML API\n\n  * Banks\n  * Cryptocurrency\n  * Early Stage Start-Ups\n  * Corporates\n  * Insurance\n  * Lending\n  * Payments\n  * WealthTech and Investments\n\n  * Press and Media\n  * Contact Us\n  * Open Positions\n  * Partner with us\n  * Insights\n  * Uncover Podcast\n  * Sitemap\n\nTerms and Conditions Cookie Policy Privacy Notice Supplemental Privacy Notice\nfor the USA Do Not Sell My Data Accessibility at ComplyAdvantage Gender pay\nreporting 2022\n\nComplyAdvantage is not a consumer reporting agency and the services (and the\ndata provided as part of its services) do not constitute a \u2018consumer report\u2019\nfor the purposes of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C.\nsec. 1681 et seq.
