See if your offering qualifies for a Blockstation STO / tokenized IPO  \n\n  * This unprecedented access to current data can help limit exposure to many business risks that have gone unresolved for decades.\n\n* * *\n\n_By: Jai Waterman, Chief Enterprise Architect_\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s take our company public - it\u2019ll be smooth sailing!\u201d  \n>  _\\- No one, ever_\n\nOn one hand you have the stock exchange: an incredible resource that\nentrepreneurs can use to raise a lot of capital from a lot of investors in a\nshort amount of time. It comes with some risks, mind you, including wiggle\nroom for bad actors to defraud investors and manipulate stock prices before\nregulators and issuers can spot the risk and react.\n\nOn the other hand you\u2019ve got the blockchain: a new technology literally\ndesigned to provide transparent, real-time access to vital information. Any\nbusiness ecosystem (like capital markets) running on the blockchain could make\nit possible for its members to detect this kind of activity as it happens, or\nprevent it entirely.\n\nIt all comes down to transparency.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about applying the blockchain to financial markets\nin the form of the Blockstation-powered Security Token Offering (STO) /\ntokenized IPO: a faster, easier, less expensive, and above all safer way to\nlist publicly traded assets on the stock market. When compared to the legacy\nInitial Public Offering (IPO), STOs / tokenized IPOs minimize the risk of\nabusive market activities that can occur undetected today.\n\nThe result? A safer, more efficient market for everybody.\n\n### **How STOs minimize market risks**\n\nWith IPOs, it\u2019s not that the information to recognize insider trading or other\nillicit activities doesn\u2019t exist. It does. The problem is that the information\nrequired to make those determinations is scattered across multiple,\ndisconnected databases owned by stock exchanges, broker-dealers, issuers, and\ndepositories. And their systems don\u2019t talk to one another.\n\n>>>>>> Take our _free_ assessment to see if your offering qualifies for an STO\n<<<<<<\n\nOne of the breakthroughs of the Blockstation STO / tokenized IPO platform is\nthat it provides a real-time portal for each member of the financial ecosystem\nto share and track vital information on the blockchain as it becomes\navailable, making it possible to minimize if not outright prevent business\nrisks including:\n\n  * Naked short selling  \n  \nThere\u2019s no hiding on the blockchain - either you own or have the right to sell\ncertain shares, or you don\u2019t. This simple fact removes a lot of the ambiguity\nwe see in the world of IPOs, where bad actors could short sell stock they\ndon\u2019t own and devalue a company\u2019s price, often without the issuer ever\nknowing.\n\n  * Failed trades  \n  \nBlockchain-enabled smart contracts can prevent failed trades by ensuring that\nthe assets to clear and settle a transaction are actually available once the\nconditions of the trade are met. This simplifies and streamlines clearance\nwhile increasing investor confidence and trust that their transactions will go\nthrough as expected.\n\n  * Hostile takeovers  \n  \nIssuers have real-time access to share activity and certain shareholder\ninformation, making it much easier to recognize when one or more parties are\namassing shares in preparation for a hostile takeover.\n\n### **Real, live STOs  **/ tokenized IPOs **are already happening**\n\nAnd Blockstation is at the forefront of this revolution, working with\nregulated financial institutions and ambitious, innovative issuers to list the\nworld\u2019s first STOs on a major national stock exchange later this year.\n\nWe truly believe in the power of STO / tokenized IPO stock and the blockchain\nto reduce the cost and risk of listing a publicly traded asset, spurring\ninnovation, driving competition, and creating new investment opportunities on\nregulated, trusted financial markets everywhere.\n\nThink you might want to conduct an STO / tokenized IPO for your company or\nasset?\n\n### **Are you a regulator, stock exchange or broker interested in learning\nmore about STOs?**\n\nContact us to schedule a workshop:\n\n### Comments (0)\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite[optional]\n\nWrite Comment\n\nPOST COMMENT\n\n###### Home\n\n###### Contact\n\n###### News\n\n__Email us\n\n__217 NY-303, Valley Cottage, NY 10989, United States\n\n__1 800-599-7180\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__\n\n\u00a9Blockstation.
