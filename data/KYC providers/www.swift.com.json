The KYC process\n\n#  The KYC process explained\n\nTake a look at the key KYC processes that enable financial institutions to\n\u2018know their customer\u2019, stay compliant and enrich the banking experience for\ntheir corporate customers.\n\n****\n\n**KYC is becoming more rigorous across the financial industry, and is even\ndriving business decisions. But what are the key processes that enable\nfinancial institutions to \u2018know their customer\u2019, stay compliant and enrich the\nbanking experience for their corporate customers?**\n\n ****\n\nTable of contents\n\n  1. Why is KYC so important?\n  2. Traditional KYC processes\n  3. A risk-based approach\n  4. The rise of the KYC registries\n\nKYC, or \"Know Your Customer\", is a set of processes that allow banks and other\nfinancial institutions to confirm the identity of the organisations and\nindividuals they do business with, and ensures those entities are acting\nlegally.\n\nEffective KYC protects companies from doing business with organisations or\nindividuals involved in illegal activity, such as money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing or corruption. It also allows financial institutions to get a better\nunderstanding of their customers\u2019 businesses, which can provide valuable\ninsights for financial institutions.\n\nWhite paper: Solving the KYC Conundrum\n\nDownload\n\n## Why is KYC so important?\n\nIn a bid to combat illegal activities that use the financial industry to move\nor hide money, governments and central banks across the world have been\ngrowing the remit and reach of their KYC policies, creating new, or extending\nexisting regulations to cover nearly every part of the global financial\necosystem.\n\nThe increased focus on KYC is partially due to the growing prevalence of\nfinancial crime across the world today. But, it also reflects the increase in\nthe number of connections between financial organisations and corporate\ncompanies across countries and territories.\n\nAcross these connections, more value than ever moves across the world each\nday, making it more difficult to stop and prevent illegal financial\nactivities. Regulators have adapted and strengthened KYC checks to keep pace.\n\n###\n\nCase study: BNP Paribas and BASF\n\nHow BNP Paribas and BASF are streamlining their KYC information collection\nprocess\n\nRead more\n\n## Traditional KYC processes\n\nFinancial institutions start the KYC process by asking customers to provide a\nrange of basic information about their business operations and individuals. It\nincludes the names of the company\u2019s directors, business addresses, national\ninsurance or social security numbers, company numbers, and so on. This\ninformation is supplemented with publically-available information about the\nentity from open sources, such as names and addresses, registration numbers,\nstock exchange listings and annual reports.\n\nThe KYC information is then compared to lists of individuals and organisations\nthat are known to governments and law enforcement agencies. The lists have a\nnumber of different aims:\n\n  * To identify individuals suspected of being involved with criminal activities\n  * To detail which jurisdiction\u2019s international sanctions companies or individuals fall under\n  * To provide intelligence on companies or individuals suspected of taking part in bribery or money laundering\n  * To identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)\n\nA few examples of internationally published lists include:\n\n  * US Department of State sanctions lists\n  * Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Lists (SDN)\n  * Financial Action Task Force lists (FATF)\n  * Transparency Index lists from Transparency International\n  * State Sponsors of Terrorism list\n\n## A risk-based approach\n\nAfter comparing the collected KYC information with the relevant lists, a\nfinancial institution will decide whether or not they can do business with the\nentity. If they pass the necessary checks, the entity will be given a risk\nrating, based on their likelihood to pass future KYC checks.\n\nWhere an entity\u2019s risk rating is considered above a threshold set by the\nfinancial institution, a greater level of scrutiny is needed. This is called\nenhanced due diligence (EDD).\n\n### Risk factors include:\n\n  * Companies based in a sanctioned territory or a country that has been identified as having high levels of corruption, money laundering or terrorism financing\n  * Directors or executives of the company that are politically exposed persons (PEPs)\n  * Legal persons named in company documents that are also the main ultimate beneficiary owners of the company\n  * Many clients of the customer being non-residents to the country where the customer operates\n  * The company being based in a country identified as not having adequate AML or counter-terrorism systems.\n  * The customer\u2019s business being mainly cash-based\n\n## The rise of the KYC registries\n\nCompleting KYC checks on all customers and entities puts a costly burden on\nfinancial institutions. What\u2019s more, KYC checks need to be completed again and\nagain as company details, regulations and the types of checks evolve over\ntime. This means that financial institutions must contact their customers\nfrequently to request KYC information.\n\nThe burden is shared by the customer, who must respond to each request for KYC\ninformation or risk delays to their transactions. This is especially true for\nglobal and multi-banked corporates who can receive large volumes of individual\nKYC requests from each of their different banks, putting strain on their\nbusiness relationships.\n\nThe idea of a central KYC registry has recently promised to solve much of this\nheadache for financial institutions and their customers. A KYC registry is a\ncentral repository that stores and keeps up-to-date the necessary KYC\ninformation for a business and that financial institutions can log into and\nconsume the information they need at any time.\n\nRegistries, such as Swift\u2019s own KYC Registry, allow the standardised exchange\nof nearly all KYC information and greatly reduce the burden of the KYC process\non both the financial institution and the corporate customer.\n\n##  Related content\n\nWhite Papers\n\n##\n\nWhite paper: Solving the KYC Conundrum\n\nDrawing on discussions with numerous treasurers around the world, this white\npaper delves into the difficulties...\n\nDownload\n\nKnow Your Customer\n\n##  The KYC challenges for corporate treasurers\n\nKYC checks are one of the top three challenges corporate treasurers face in\ntheir banking relationships.\n\nRead more\n\nKnow Your Customer\n\n##  The KYC challenges for correspondent banks\n\nBanks are looking to streamline their KYC processes for business to continue\nto thrive, improve client...\n\nRead more\n\n##\n\nGet personalised insights straight to your inbox\n\nSign up now\n\nStay connected\n\nTwitter Go to Twitter LinkedIn Go to LinkedIn Facebook Go to Facebook Youtube\nGo to Youtube\n\n## Footer navigation\n\n  * About Us \n    * Community \n    * Legal \n    * Media Centre \n    * Swift Institute \n    * Careers \n  * Your needs \n    * Banking & payments \n    * Financial Crime & cyber security \n    * Data & technology \n    * Capital Markets \n    * Corporate treasury \n    * Market Infrastructures \n  * Our Solutions \n    * Global Financial Messaging \n    * Interfaces and Integration \n    * Compliance and Shared Services \n    * Market Infrastructures \n    * Swift for Corporates \n  * News & Events \n    * Press Release \n    * White Papers \n    * Events \n    * Webinars \n  * Ordering & Support \n    * Our Support offering \n    * Products ordering and configuration \n    * Billing and invoicing \n    * Swift Smart \n\nHeadquarters\n\nAvenue Adele 1, 1310 La Hulpe\n\nTel\n\n+32 2 655 31 11\n\nFax\n\n+32 2 655 32 26\n\nGet in touch\n\n  * Privacy statement \n  * Terms of use \n  * Modern slavery statement \n  * Website feedback \n  * Cookies settings \n\n\u00a9 2023 Swift\n\nLoading...\n\n",
