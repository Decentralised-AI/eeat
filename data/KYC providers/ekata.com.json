Digital KYC compliance enables businesses to operate securely in the\ndigital realm while safeguarding their interests and those of their customers.\n\nContact Us\n\nEkata assists in the challenging process of KYC compliance. In the rapidly\nevolving online landscape, ensuring the safety and security of sensitive\ninformation is paramount. This security is essential as businesses\nincreasingly rely on digital platforms. One crucial aspect of a business\u2019s\nsecurity framework for security needs and compliance requirements is the\nimplementation of eKYC solution (Know Your Customer).\n\nKYC compliance is vital for finance, banking, e-commerce and other industries\nthat involve online transactions and sensitive data. KYC refers to the\nverification and authentication procedures businesses employ to verify the\nidentity and credibility of their customers. It consists in collecting and\nanalyzing customer information to ensure compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, prevent fraudulent activities, mitigate risks and establish\ntrust.\n\nBy implementing robust digital KYC verification, businesses can combat fraud\neffectively. Fraudulent activities, such as identity theft, fake accounts and\nfinancial scams, can cause substantial economic losses, damage a company\u2019s\nreputation and erode customer trust.\n\nThe challenge is that KYC compliance is often cumbersome to customers and\ncostly to businesses and companies. Ekata comes alongside your business to aid\nin implementing KYC compliance by mitigating applicants and pre-verifying who\nneeds KYC compliance checks. Ekata\u2019s services verify the authenticity of\ncustomer-provided information and documents before they engage in complete KYC\ncompliance checks. Ekata enables businesses to avoid unnecessary delays and\nsaves time and resources by detecting and addressing any inconsistencies or\ninaccuracies in the initial stages.\n\nEkata leverages their expertise and technology to enhance the efficiency and\neffectiveness of their KYC compliance processes. Ekata\u2019s solutions not only\naid in mitigating the burden on customers but also assist businesses in\noptimizing their resources and reducing costs.\n\nBy implementing our Account Opening API, customers saw a 60% increase in\npassive verifications and a 50% reduction in customer account creation drop-\noffs before the KYC process.\n\n## Features and Benefits\n\n  * Ekata enhances the KYC process by pinpointing high-risk versus low-risk applicants during onboarding.\n  * Unlike the deterministic approach to risk assessment in KYC, AML and OCR, Ekata uses a probabilistic approach to understand digital identity elements and how they link to one another and behave.\n  * Ekata augments your KYC processes by giving financial institutions the confidence to determine the appropriate workflow for each applicant at onboarding (the first touchpoint). This initial touchpoint directs low-risk applicants towards a more efficient workflow, while high-risk applicants are subject to additional verification steps, such as phone calls, branch visits or further regulatory checks.\n\n  * By pinpointing high-risk applicants, banks with our solution only need to put the riskiest individuals through KYC. This reduces the monetary cost of KYC compliance for businesses.\n  * This workflow also reduces onboarding costs and saves money in the long run by preventing fraud (most notably synthetic identities). Traditional KYC procedures are too static to detect sophisticated fraud.\n\n## How our customers experience Ekata\n\n\u201cWe get a risk score associated with any successfully created account.\nAlongside that, we create different thresholds. So, if you meet a higher risk\nthreshold, then you can only perform certain actions on the platform. And if\nyou\u2019re too high risk, you get a message telling you to contact customer\nsupport instead of being allowed entry.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Darren Cody, Marketplace Studio co-founder\n\n## Trust is key\n\nEkata\u2019s worked within the industry to rise above and create fraud prevention\nthat truly performs.\n\n  * Best Overall Digital Identity Solution Provider in 2022 FinTech Breakthrough Awards\n  * Ekata APAC recognized as \u201cFinTech of the Year\u201d by AMTD DigFin\n  * Shortlisted at the 2022 SaaS Awards in the \u201cBest SaaS for E-Commerce / E-Shops\u201d category\n\n  * Ekata\u2019s Account Opening solution was named \u201cBest API \u2013 Payments\u201d at Singapore Business Review\u2019s Technology Excellence Awards 2022\n  * Ekata Identity Engine was named a finalist at the 2022 Paytech Awards in the \u201cTech of the Future\u201d category\n\n## Trusted by over 2,000 Customers Worldwide\n\n## Ekata\u2019s AO Solution is accurate, efficient and easy to use, thus reducing\nfraud, complying with regulations and improving customer satisfaction.\n\nIt is built as a comprehensive tool to improve the KYC process.
