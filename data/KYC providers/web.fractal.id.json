For platforms like CrowdSwap, how\ndoes a partnership with Fractal ID pave the way for increased user control?**\n\nIn the second installment of the Fractal ID interview series, we spoke with\nthe Co-Founder of CrowdSwap \u2014 Christian M\u00fclder. The conversation explores the\nrelevance of decentralized identity solutions \u2014 ranging from KYC checks to\nhuman liveness \u2014 to secure transactions, protect privacy, and establish trust\nin the world of DEXs. Christian also dives into the need to resolve the\n**\u201ctrade-off between platform security & user anonymity\u201d** while shedding\nlight on the pertinence of identity interoperability to drive user adoption.\n\nOne of the most powerful USPs of decentralized exchanges, as opposed to\ncentralized platforms, is heightened anonymity. However, despite continuous\nadvancements in swapping experiences within the DEX space, challenges persist.\nAmidst increased regulatory scrutiny, the need of the hour is to  **attract\nnew**  and  **maintain existing**  users. The ability to verify each user that\ncontributes to liquidity pools will change the game.\n\nAre  **decentralized identity systems  **the obvious solution?\n\nAccurate, compliant, flexible, and scalable KYC providers are pertinent\n\n> **_Fractal ID: Could you please introduce CrowdSwap and what makes it\n> different from other DEXs in the space?_**\n\n**Christian:**   _CrowdSwap, as a decentralized exchange, is a one-stop shop\nfor DeFi enthusiasts that aims to decrease the barriers to profit from DeFi\nopportunities. With our automation and optimization approach, users can easily\ntake advantage of the best opportunities without the hassle of knowing every\ndetail about the necessary steps. The CrowdSwap dApp wraps all steps into a\nminimum number of transactions. Users benefit from spending less time\nsearching for the best prices, cross-chain bridges, and adding liquidity to\nthe correct places. Plus, we provide a wide range of services for other\nprojects to launch in the DeFi space._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: The concept of user verification can inhibit crypto users who\n> value anonymity. How do we resolve that vis-a-vis platform security? Can a\n> DEX go without KYC/AML?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _There is yet to be a definitive answer on how to resolve\nthis trade-off between platform security and user anonymity. A DEX may not be\nable to verify the identity or legitimacy of its users or their transactions.\nThis may expose the DEX and its users to potential fraud, scams, phishing,\nhacking, or other malicious attacks. While a DEX technically can provide users\nsecurity without having KYC/AML procedures, it may also face some trade-offs\nand challenges in doing so. Some possible solutions or alternatives for a DEX\nto balance security and compliance are implementing selective or optional\nKYC/AML procedures and leveraging decentralized identity (DID) solutions._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: For our readers, please describe to which length you\u2019ve\n> integrated identity verification checks on your platform._**\n\n**Christian:  ** _CrowdSwap is a DEX that respects users willing to be\nanonymous. Our dApp doesn\u2019t ask for identity verification for swaps and\nopportunity investing. However, in our  _ _launchpad_ _  feature, which is a\ntool for token pre-sale, users need to pass the KYC procedure, which is\nmandatory for all investors. KYC levels and details can vary for projects that\nwant to launch their tokens through CrowdSwap._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: You offer a broad range of DeFi opportunities. What are the\n> grounds for a suspicious transaction on your platform that indicates\n> potential fraudulent activity?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _There are different types of suspicious transactions like\nphishing and impersonation, high-value transactions in a short period, and\nvirtual fund transfers to low-regulated dominions that indicate potential\nfraudulent activity. Investors should always do their own research, check\nsmart contracts, and use reputable platforms and wallets to protect themselves\nfrom DeFi fraud._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: You use Fractal ID to KYC users that participate in Crowd\n> Sale. What are the main considerations to keep in mind when choosing a KYC\n> provider?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _A KYC service can bridge the gap between privacy and\ncompliance by providing a  _ ** _secure and efficient_** _  way to verify\ncustomers\u2019 identities and backgrounds while respecting their data protection\nrights and preferences. User onboarding is also very important for KYC\nproviders, as it is the first step to establishing a trusted relationship with\nyour customers and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. A good user\nonboarding process should be simple, cost-effective, fast, accurate, secure,\ncompliant, flexible, and scalable. Choosing a KYC provider offering these\nhigh-quality services can improve customer satisfaction, retention, and\nloyalty while reducing operational costs and compliance risks._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: CrowdSwap is one of Fractal ID\u2019s clients with access to our\n> most innovative identity solution \u2014 the DID registry. How has this\n> integration impacted verification time, costs, and onboarding of users\n> overall?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _Fractal ID\u2019s DID registry can reduce the verification time\nfor KYC providers, as we can use the existing digital identities of our users\ninstead of requesting and verifying new documents or information. It can lower\nthe costs for KYC providers, as we can leverage the shared infrastructure and\nnetwork of the DID registry instead of building and maintaining our own\nidentity systems. It can also improve the onboarding of users for KYC\nproviders, as we can offer a more user-friendly and convenient experience for\nour customers, who can control their own digital identities and consent to\nshare them with the KYC providers. Therefore, Fractal ID\u2019s DID registry can\npositively impact verification time, costs, and onboarding of users for KYC\nproviders, by providing a decentralized, secure, and interoperable solution\nfor digital identity management._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: You\u2019re currently using two DID registries Fractal ID\n> provided: one is on  _** ** _Polygon_** ** _, and the other one is on  _**\n> ** _BNB Smart Chain_** ** _. Please explain how exactly you are leveraging\n> both registries. Why is identity interoperability relevant to DEXs like\n> yours?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _Identity interoperability is relevant to DEXs because it can\nenable  _ ** _cross-chain trading_** _,  _ ** _self-sovereign identity,_** _\nand _ ** _regulatory compliance_** _. Identity interoperability can allow\nusers to trade assets across different blockchain networks without relying on\ncentralized intermediaries or custodians. Also, it reduces the risks of fraud,\nmoney laundering, and other illegal activities, as well as compliance costs._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: With the EU\u2019s MiCA legislation now coming into force, the\n> next iteration is over the licensing of DeFi smart contract codes. How will\n> such measures impact DEXs like CrowdSwap?_**\n\n**Christian: _ _** _DeFi smart contract codes are currently not regulated by\nthe MiCA legislation, as they do not fall under the definition of crypto-asset\nservice providers or issuers. Licensing DeFi smart contract codes could\nsignificantly impact DEXs like CrowdSwap, which are platforms that allow users\nto trade crypto-assets directly with each other using DeFi smart contracts.\nSome of the possible impacts are increased compliance costs and barriers,\nreduced decentralization and autonomy, and enhanced user trust. This could  _\n** _positively and negatively  _** _impact DEXs like CrowdSwap, depending on\nhow the regulation is designed and implemented._\n\n> **_Fractal ID: What is next for CrowdSwap?_**\n\n**Christian:  ** _CrowdSwap is constantly working on improving its services\nand offering new opportunities to its users. We are also planning to release a\nlot of new features in the future, such as the VIP program, limit order (set a\ntarget price for your swap), and a lot of improvements in our swap and cross-\nchain features which will lead to better user experience and add more use\ncases to our CROWD token._\n\n## Thank you for your time, Christian.
