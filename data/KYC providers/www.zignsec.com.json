In today's digital arena and competitive market, the\nadvantages of employing Regtech SaaS solutions include, but are not limited\nto, reducing costs, enhancing operational performance, and ensuring regulatory\ncompliance.**\n\n##  **Identity verification is crucial for building online trust**\n\nKnowing whom you're interacting with remotely in a digital setting is crucial\nfor most businesses with commercial online operations. For banks and financial\ninstitutions governed by AML requirements, identity verification is and has\nfor quite some time been a mandatory part of their KYC process for customer\nonboarding. In the ever-evolving digital age of today, the pressing need to\nperform identity-based authentication has become evident within a multitude of\nother industries and sectors. In part, this is due to tightening regulations\nand increasing consumer demands, but the widespread need to implement an\nidentity verification solution is primarily due to a truth that no serious\nbusiness with online operations can afford to ignore:  \n\nThe only reliable way for a business to be sure of whom they're dealing with\nonline is by collecting and verifying the personal data of a prospective\ncustomer and checking that it's a live person seeking access to the platform\nor service, not an imitation or spoof.\n\n### **Manual vs digital method for ID verification**\n\nMany online businesses use manual ID verification, especially new SMEs who\nmight need more economic resources or customers to justify exploring better\nsolutions. This entails that employees check the customers' digitally\nsubmitted government-issued ID documents by hand. However, due to human errors\nand lengthy processing time, this is an unacceptable ID verification\nexperience for the customers and an everyday struggle for the business. In\nessence, more is needed to compete in an online market where speed and\naccuracy is the key differentiating factor for customers to be willing to\nspend their money on a service or platform. Unfortunately, manual ID document\nverification can take days, and accuracy leaves much to be desired.  \n\nDigital solutions for identity verification utilise machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and automation that outperform human capabilities in\nspeed and accuracy. But the traditional onsite model for software installation\nin a business environment is costly and cumbersome as it requires building the\nserver, installing the application, and configuring it. With the convenient\nalternative of SaaS (Software as a Service), the applications reside on a\nremote cloud network accessed through the web or an API. Regtech SaaS is a\ncloud computing offering that provides businesses access to cloud-based\nsoftware, such as an identity verification solution. It works like a\nsubscription where companies subscribe to having access to a vendor's SaaS\ncloud network for some time and pay for the software they use.\n\n#### **The perks of employing a SaaS solution**\n\nSaaS solutions reside in scalable cloud environments that usually have\nintegrations with additional SaaS offerings. Companies with access to this\nenvironment enjoy the flexibility of employing these Regtech tools and\nsolutions at will and effortlessly scale their SaaS use up according to needs.\nBusinesses that employ SaaS for compliance spend virtually no time on\ninstallation and configuration since the software application is already\ninstalled and configured. Furthermore, SaaS resides in a multi-subscriber\nenvironment, rendering the hardware and software license costs low compared\nwith the traditional model. Maintenance costs are also reduced as the SaaS\nprovider's responsibility is to keep its offerings functional. Thus, costs\nassociated with upgrades and new releases are also lower than with the\ntraditional onsite model. This allows SMEs to use software they otherwise\nwould not use due to the high cost of licensing, maintenance, and such. From a\ncompliance, cost and competitive point of view, online businesses should\ninvest in a SaaS solution for identity verification, leveraging automation for\nonboarding customers faster, enhancing the customer experience, decreasing the\nrisk of fraud, and ensuring the KYC process.\n\n#### **What\u2019s the best choice of Regtech SaaS vendor for your business?**\n\nBeing a well-established and seasoned SaaS Regtech vendor, ZignSec offers the\noperational capacity, expertise, and technology at the forefront of digital\nidentity verification.
