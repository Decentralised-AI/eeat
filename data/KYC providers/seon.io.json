I can see it\u2019s been registered on these 15 other\nsocial websites. From then I can just manually match the relevant information\nto make my case. Working with more accurate data allows me and my team to move\nfaster \u2013 and with minimum user friction. Whereas the team had to wait hours or\ndays to verify someone\u2019s payment, SEON allows them to do it in 30 mins or\nless.\"\n\nRick Hiltbrunner\n\nSenior Manager of Fraud Operations\n\n\"As soon as our staff used SEON on a regular basis, they could see its value.\nIt immediately started saving them time as they didn\u2019t have to trawl through\nthe usual checkpoints. So much so, that the time spent by Air France analysts\non manual reviews is down by an impressive 70%. Instead, all the information\nthey needed was on one screen with a simple scoring system enabling them to\nsee if a transaction was real or not.\"\n\nEric Facquet\n\nDeputy Manager of Fraud Prevention\n\n\"The most useful thing for us was to be able to see if the email and phone\nnumbers weren\u2019t registered anywhere. We also rely on the device fingerprinting\nmetadata in our scorecard to filter out junk users. We immediately saved about\n6% of costs on our automated KYC checks. After only 2 months, we started\nseeing impressive results. Up to 3 times fewer cases of defaulting customers\nin new regions such as Romania and Europe. 4 months later, the fraud rates\ndropped by over 65%.\"\n\nSergey Bogdanov\n\nChief Risk Officer\n\n\"We were looking at another provider, but they came back to us with a 4-6\nmonths integration window. With SEON, it was literally a phone call, sandbox\ntests on Monday and by the end of the week, it was done. One other thing I\u2019d\nlike to comment on is the pricing model. It\u2019s really 2022, like for scaling\ntogether. The SEON model, it\u2019s now one we actively look for with our other\npartners. Clearly an organization that approaches work and its customers in a\ndifferent way.\"\n\nCoert Snyman\n\nSenior Analyst\n\n\"I tested some extra rules, and over a few months I managed to push SEON\u2019s\nauto approval from an initial accuracy of 95% unto 99.5%. Taking the time to\nupdate your SEON rules is an investment that gives great results. And the best\nthing is that we can do so without deploying any software. From an engineering\nperspective, it is extremely time and resource saving, allowing us to react\nmuch faster.\"\n\nPhillipp Keller\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t believe how fast the results came,\u201d says Gergely. \u201cOur chargeback\nrates dropped by 91% in one month only.\u201d Moreover, the number of manual\nqueries and fraud catch rates continued to improve after the initial 30 days\nas the system adjusted itself \u2013 part of the benefits of deploying a machine-\nlearning algorithm to fine-tune accuracy.\"\n\nGergely K\u00e1lm\u00e1n\n\nCEO\n\n\"SEON allows us to stay one step ahead as by keeping advantage players at bay\nwe are able to continue offering competitive bonuses with low wagering\nrequirements to our players,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cAnd the fact that SEON team are so\nopen to feedback and implement the feedback quickly gives us as their client a\nsignificant advantage which we couldn\u2019t find with other competitors in their\nfield.\"\n\nDaniel Saliba\n\nHead of Compliance\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t just the technology that\u2019s great though, the education side of\nthings helped us understand the types of tactics and patterns used by\nfraudsters and put rules into place to prevent them.\"\n\nStacey Pickering\n\nHead of Operations\n\n\"We deployed SEON both on our website and web app to gather device data as\nwell as IP and email information. It was unbelievably fast, both in terms of\nintegration and results. In 4 days only, our fraud rates were pretty much down\nto 0.\"\n\nLewis Bye\n\nSenior Projects and Operations Specialist\n\n\"We overlay SEON\u2019s digital and social lookup with device fingerprinting to get\na good indication of whether the phone or tablet belongs to the actual client.\nWe can instantly filter out obvious fraudsters with no digital or social\npresence, and we get better intelligence to automate our decision making.\"\n\nJuris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161\n\nHead of Risk\n\n\"One core piece of data we get from SEON is the ability to profile customers\nbased on a phone number. Because what we do is through WhatsApp, being able to\ncheck social signals really helps us get a better sense of how real the user\nis. It\u2019s a tool in our toolkit that is pretty unique.\"\n\nJonathan Kleinmann\n\nHead Of Partnerships\n\n 4.7 4.9\n\n## We\u2019re About  \nSimplicity\n\nFraud detection is complex enough.  \nWe\u2019re making it easy for everyone to fight fraud.\n\n### Unbeatable time to value\n\nProve ROI in days thanks to our free trial and transparent pay-as-you-go\npricing.  \n  \nForget about hidden costs or multi-year contracts, and scale your operations\nwith complete peace of mind.\n\n### Faster risk management\n\nGet transparent fraud scores within a second as a result of our automated, AI-\ndriven workflow.  \n  \nThe intuitive Admin Panel boosts collaboration and productivity with widgets,\ncustom rules and full team management features.\n\n### Frictionless integration\n\nDeploy SEON in a couple of hours with well-documented REST APIs and plug-and-\nplay SDKs for device data collection.  \n  \nStart seeing results immediately, without slowing your business operations.\n\n## Stress-Freefor You\n\n100%Annoying for fraudsters\n\n### Speak with an expert\n\nSpeak to a fraud fighter\n\n## Resources\n\n by\n\n by\n\n by\n\n by\n\n by\n\n  * Articles\n\n  * Case Studies\n\n  * News\n\n  * Videos\n\n  * Podcasts\n\n  * Webinars\n\n  * Guides\n\n  * Comparisons\n\n  * Dictionary\n\nSee all resources\n\n## Sign up for our newsletter\n\nThe top stories of the month delivered straight to your inbox\n\n## Backed by the Best in Venture\n\n### Joined by the most ambitious angels, founders and execs.\n\nFraud Fighters\n\ne: info@seon.io\n\nContact Us\n\n4.74.9\n\n* * *\n\nNavigation\n\n  * Home\n  * Features\n  * Pricing\n  * Integration\n  * API Status\n  * Resources\n  * Speak with an Expert\n  * FAQ\n\nMenu\n\n  * Developers\n  * Careers\n  * Contact Us\n  * About\n  * Login\n\nSocial\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n\u00a9 Copyright SEON Technologies Ltd. - Legal & Security\n\nMade with  in Budapest, London, Austin & Jakarta\n\n",
