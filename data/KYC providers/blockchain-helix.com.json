Our investment in helix id\nunderlines our philosophy of investing in technology that offers solutions for\nthe digital age. With helix id we have invested in a very experienced and\nambitious team that shares our strategy and vision.\"\n\nStefan Sch\u00fctzeMember of the management board, FinLab AG\n\n\"Blockchain-based identity management is the next big thing in digital\ntransformation where customers have a clear benefit: owning their data, having\nfull privacy and not having hundreds of passwords for hundreds of user\naccounts.\"\n\nProf. Dr. Philipp SandnerFrankfurt School Blockchain Center\n\n\"Blockchain HELIX is introducing with helix id the Digital Identity to the\nmarket. As FATF has recently recommended, such a product will provide a tool\nto apply more efficient and low-risk Know-Your-Customer checks for Anti-Money-\nLaundering purposes. It also gives the customer the power to protect his\nprivacy when dealing with corporates. A great achievement for the Blockchain\necosystem by a German Blockchain veteran.\"\n\nAlireza SiadatSimmons & Simmons\n\n\"Especially for banks helix id offers an interesting solution for the Digital\nIdentity on the Blockchain. helix id provides a platform on which personal\ndata can be shared by institutions, companies and banks in the B2B sector and\nwhere the requirements of the DSGVO are met. The Know-Your-Customer (KYC)\nprocess can thus be carried out quickly and securely.\"\n\nDr. Gerhard GrebeManaging Director, banXconsult GmbH\n\n\"There is a strong requirement for Digital Identity in the online and mobile\nworld. Digital processes need to be implemented from a customer\u2019s perspective\nwithout media disruption. The convenient and secure verification of identity,\ncombined with a TAN-free authentication and approval using digital signature\nare the key success factors.\"\n\nJ\u00fcrgen WeissExecutive, Seal ONE\n\n\"Trust is the basis of decentralized business relationships.
