In fact, globally financial\ninstitutions spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year __on anti-money\nlaundering compliance and technology solutions that help protect and\nauthenticate consumer identity (I.e., identity proofing, biometrics, and\nmulti-factor authentication to name a few).\n\nCreating and implementing effective customer identity verification processes\n__is essential to reducing the risk of fraudulent transactions and ensuring\nregulatory compliance.\n\nOne such approach is to share information among banks and governments through\na multi-step model called Know Your Customer (KYC) \u2013 which may involve a\ncentral database maintained by a consortium of banks like Swift __whereby\nconsumer data is used to verify their identity and identify any potential\nrisks of doing business with them. self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new\ndecentralized identity model that can help banks to solve the existing\nchallenges of sharing KYC information securely and cost-effectively.\n\nWith decentralized KYC, the customer can be issued a KYC verifiable credential\nthat can be cryptographically verified and stored on the customer\u2019s mobile\nwallet. Verifiable credentials are trustworthy, tamper-proof, and machine-\nverifiable digital identity documents. The verifiable credentials can be\nissued by KYC providers and verified by other service providers for\nauthenticity and ownership. The customer may proactively trigger issuance of\nsuch credentials or as part of an existing KYC process. KYC verifiable\ncredentials provide a strong benefit to all involved \u2013 a seamless customer\nexperience, as well as a simplified and more cost-effective processes for\nbanks and service providers.\n\nA lot of progress has been made in recent years in the field of self-sovereign\nidentity:\n\n  * Ratification of standards like W3C VC, and DID\n  * European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) framework matured with POCs and pilot projects under way\n  * eIDAS 2.0 close to being released\n  * British Columbia Government launches VON (Verifiable Organizations Network)\n  * Increased number of SSI networks all around the world\n\neIDAS 2.0 will mandate business and government organizations within the EU to\naccept decentralized identity verifiable credentials stored in digital\nwallets. KYC providers must ensure they are ready to integrate with the EBSI\nframework.\n\n**Benefits for all when KYC verified credentials are implemented**\n\nIncremental deployment of AI/ML technology has enabled online KYC checks that\nprovide a significant improvement over the manual KYC process. With the manual\nKYC processes, a considerable amount of time and resources are spent on\nreviewing checks for the same user repeatedly.\n\nImagine a user onboarding experience using a verifiable KYC credential as\nfollows:\n\n  1. Customer visits service provider website\n  2. Customer scans a QR code with their mobile wallet\n  3. A secure encrypted channel is established between the mobile wallet and website\n  4. Service provider requests KYC credentials\n  5. Customer consents to sharing their verifiable KYC credential\n  6. Service provider website lets them in\n\nAnd this process only takes a few seconds!\n\nThe reusable nature of KYC verifiable credentials and user control of their\nown data lends itself nicely to an exceptional user experience and builds\nconfidence around privacy. Additionally, the reusable KYC credentials enhance\nbusiness process efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nRepeated cost of passport and driver license scans, facial recognition, and\nliveness detection for KYC can add up and impact the P&L significantly. With\nKYC verifiable credentials, the cost is reduced significantly, and that\nfinancial benefit can be passed on to the banks by KYC providers while\nmaintaining higher margins.\n\nAs decentralized verifiable credentials are stored in mobile wallets, there is\nsignificantly reduced risk of data being stolen. Mobile wallets enable user\nconsent to ensure no information leakage, as well as maintaining a strong\nsecurity and privacy posture.\n\nWith rapidly increasing adoption and acceptance of  decentralized identity\n(~27% CAGR), KYC providers can benefit from issuing KYC verifiable\ncredentials.\n\nContact our experts to discuss your organization\u2019s needs.\n\n  * Identity & Access Management\n\nRajan Barara / _VIEW ALL OF Rajan'S POSTS_ Director, Product Management\n\nRajan Barara is the Director, Product Management for Entrust, where he leads\nthe Global Authentication Cloud business segment.
