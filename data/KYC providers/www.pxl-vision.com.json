Its execution in these industries has proven\ninstrumental in the prevention of money laundering and other financial crimes,\nboth domestically and on an international scale. While these procedures are\ntraditionally carried out in person with physical documentation, this method\nhas become largely impractical due to the pace and digital transformation of\nour modern world.\n\nAs the vast majority of business operations migrate toward a centralized\ndigital environment, KYC procedures must do the same. The digital form of KYC\nis also known as eKYC. To make this switch possible, financial institutions\nand other companies now require a compliant eKYC platform to assist them in\nthe establishment and customization of the digital workflow. In short,\ndigitalizing the KYC process calls for the support and expertise of a KYC\nservice provider.\n\n## Understanding KYC\n\nKYC, or Know Your Customer, is a set of regulatory guidelines that define the\nprocess of identifying and verifying a customer's identity, in addition to the\ncontinual monitoring of their account transactions. KYC can be separated into\nthree pillars: (1) Customer Identification, (2) Customer Due Diligence, and\n(3) Enhanced Due Diligence.\n\n### (1) Customer Identification Program\n\nSimply put, Customer Identification Program (CIP) is the process of\nidentifying a customer's identity prior to their onboarding. A customer's\nidentity must be proven with government issued documents and facial\nverification.\n\n\n\n### (2) Customer Due Diligence\n\nCustomer Due Diligence (CDD) is basically an investigation of the potential\ncustomer's financial or legal background and activities, in addition to the\ncreation of a Customer Risk Profile. The Customer Risk Profile assesses the\npotential risk a customer may pose to the safety of the institution or company\nand its existing customers. CDD is a critical step in the KYC process that\nrequires thoroughness and accuracy.\n\n### (3) Enhanced Due Diligence\n\nEnhanced Due Diligence (EDD) follows the initial customer onboarding. Once the\ncustomer's identity has been verified and their risk profile is created,\nanalyzed, and finally accepted, EDD is responsible for the ongoing account\nmonitoring and risk management. If any suspicious transactions or activities\noccur, these will be red flagged and should immediately be reported to the\nappropriate regulatory authority.\n\n### KYB\n\nKYC is applicable to more than just customers. It is also mandatory for\nfinancial institutions and companies to follow through with a KYC check for\nbusinesses prior to account creation or the approval of a business\npartnership. This is referred to as Know Your Business (KYB) or Corporate KYC.\nSo, KYB is a variation of KYC. Because verifying a business is far more\ncomplex than an individual customer, KYB requires a more advanced process.\n\n\n\n### eKYC\n\nElectronic KYC, or better known as eKYC, is the digitalized version of the\nstandard KYC process. Companies that switch their KYC or KYB policies to a\ndigital format require a KYC service provider to provide a compliant and\ncompatible solution for their use case and specific needs.\n\neKYC solutions are generally more cost-effective, faster, more accurate, and\nconvenient for both the business and the end user. The ability to perform KYC\nChecks in a remote environment enables institutions and companies to scale-up\nand easily collaborate with customers and other businesses around the world.\n\n\n\n## What is a KYC service provider?\n\nKYC service providers offer digital KYC solutions to financial institutions,\ncorporations, and online platforms. These SaaS companies enable their clients\nto convert the time and resources invested into manual KYC procedures to a\ndigital platform that is fast, accurate, and user-friendly. Furthermore, SaaS\nsolutions for KYC reduce overhead expenses, decrease customer drop-out rates,\nstrengthen security, and increase ROI.\n\nThere are many industries that require KYC checks, and those industries often\ncome with multiple use cases. Some KYC service providers offer the full suite\nof KYC solutions, while others may specialize in a specific use case or\nindustry.\n\nKYC service providers are mostly SaaS (Software as a Service) companies. Their\nsolutions are primarily developed by teams of software engineers, KYC and\ncompliance industry experts, data protection engineers, and legal consultants.\nKYC service providers benefit both the client corporation directly and their\ncustomers with user-friendly, swift, online or mobile verification processes.\nMany customers simply do not have the time or possibility to physically travel\nto a financial institution or company for a KYC check. That is what makes KYC\nservice providers indispensable to customer satisfaction during the onboarding\nprocess.  \n\n## Finding a KYC service provider\n\nFinding the right KYC service provider is an important step toward the\nsuccessful scaling of your business. Since KYC or KYB Checks are an integral\npart of the customer onboarding process, any friction in the User Experience\n(UX) may result in higher drop-out rates.\n\nNot all businesses need to implement the full KYC process. There are different\nuse cases, such as age verification, identity verification, or account access\nmanagement. Therefore, a business may prefer to find a KYC service provider\nthat specializes in their specific use case. Similarly, some KYC service\nproviders will specialize in a specific industry, such as KYC for online\ngambling and crypto exchange platforms, or age verification for e-commerce,\nage-restricted content, and online gaming.\n\n### Key elements of a good KYC service provider\n\nRegardless of whether a KYC service provider offers end-to-end KYC services, a\nspecialized KYC service, or a full suite of KYC services, there are a few key\nelements that every potential KYC service provider should deliver. These key\nelements can serve as a guideline to help you identify the best option for\nyour company.\n\n  * Advanced AI technology and/or Biometric Facial Recognition technology for accurate and swift identity verification and document verification.\n  * Compliance on an international scale. Check to see which countries' government databases the KYC service provider can access to uphold compliance with their jurisdiction. Compliance across many countries means a greater capacity for companies to scale up and remain compliant without delay.\n  * Frictionless UX and easy-to-use UI for ultimate customer satisfaction. Delays, technical difficulties, or unclear processes reduce customer conversion and ROI. Make sure the KYC service provider guarantees a proven method that customers will enjoy.\n\n## KYC Compliance\n\nThroughout most of the world, KYC is a legal obligation for all financial\ninstitutions. However, with the advancements of technology and the rapid\nincrease in identity theft, fraud, money laundering, and other forms of\nfinancial crime, KYC is now mandatory for companies in other industries as\nwell. For example, companies or organizations that process monetary\ntransactions or that require identity or age verification for restricted\ncontent or purchases are also obliged to comply with relevant KYC regulations.\nThese may include non-profit organizations, online casinos and gambling\nplatforms, insurance agencies, crypto exchange platforms, and online gaming\nplatforms.\n\nRegulatory KYC guidelines differ based on the type of business, services\noffered and the specific jurisdiction of each country. To ensure that your\nbusiness is compliant, KYC service providers have legal teams and KYC experts\nto assist your company in choosing the appropriate guidelines for your\ncompany.\n\nAs each country has its own take on what the KYC requirements should be,\nfinding the right KYC service provider is also a critical decision that\naffects the accessibility of financial institutions and other companies.\nIdeally, the KYC service provider will offer a solution that is tailored to\nyour use case and is compliant with the KYC regulations of any relevant\njurisdiction.\n\n* * *\n\n### KYC Check\n\nA KYC Check is the actual application of KYC regulations. It consists of three\nfundamental steps: Customer Identification Program (CIP), Customer Due\nDiligence (CDD), and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). To begin, a customer's\nidentity must first be verified by matching the required documents, which must\nalso be verified as legitimate with the customer's live presence.\n\nA KYC service provider accomplishes this by scanning or taking photos of\ncustomer documents, in addition to scanning their face or taking a short\nselfie video. From there, the AI or biometric technology built into the\nplatform will match the information extracted from the documents and facial\nrecognition to government databases to confirm the customer's identity.\n\nNext, a new customer is to carry out Customer Due Diligence, which involves\nresearch into the customer's financial and legal history, performing a\nsanction check, and ensuring that they are not a Politically Exposed Person\n(PEP).\n\nKYC Checks sound time-consuming and complicated, and they are; however, that\nis the very reason why KYC service providers exist. You can rest assured when\nyou have a KYC service provider to tackle the seemingly daunting task of KYC\nChecks.\n\n### Document Requirements for KYC\n\nThe minimum document requirements for a KYC check include:\n\n  * Proof of Identity (POI), such as a government-issued ID card, birth certificate, passport, or residence permit;\n  * Proof of Address (POA), such as a utility bill, lease agreement, or a house deed.\n\nIn some cases, usually with financial institutions such as credit agencies or\nbanks, Proof of Income will also be required. Usually an income letter from an\nemployer will meet this requirement. For those who are self-employed or need\nsupporting documents, bank statements, pay stubs, and a recent tax return\nstatement are all acceptable Proof of Income documents.\n\n\n\n### KYB Check\n\nGenerally speaking, KYB checks follow the same process as a KYC check. The\nmost obvious difference is the document requirements. Financial institutions\nand companies will require official documents from other businesses, such as\narticles of incorporation, business registration, or a shareholder registry.\nMoreover, CDD for KYB is both more intensive and extensive than KYC.\n\n\n\n### Document Requirements for KYB\n\nThe minimum document requirements for a KYB Check include:\n\n  * Any official document confirming the legal existence of the business, such as a certificate of business registration or articles of incorporation.\n  * Proof of Identity for all Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs), such as a shareholder registry, an incumbency certificate, or trust agreement. \n\nIf the corporation has intermediate holding companies or subsidiaries, similar\ndocuments for each of those companies will also be required.\n\n## PXL Vision - Enterprise-Grade IDV Solutions\n\nAt PXL Vision, we strive to present our clientele with premium IDV solutions\nthat can be applied across a multitude of use cases and industries.

A customizable eKYC platform is ideal for creating an efficient\nworkflow for your company and the best user experience for your customers.\n\n\n\n### Is eKYC better than traditional KYC?\n\nWhile traditional KYC measures require an in-person meeting for the customer\nto deliver documents for identity verification, eKYC must rely on AI\ntechnology and/or biometrics to verify those documents and the live presence\nof the customer.  \nOverall, the benefits of eKYC outweigh the benefits of the traditional, in-\nperson KYC method. eKYC is cost-effective, quick, accessible, convenient, and\nit eliminates human error. At the end of the day, implementing eKYC through a\nKYC service provider has proven to be more efficient and accurate than\ntraditional KYC.\n\n\n\n### Am I obliged to comply with KYC regulations?\n\nAll banks and financial institutions are obliged to comply with strict KYC/KYB\nregulations.
