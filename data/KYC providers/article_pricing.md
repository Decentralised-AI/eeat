Given the complexity and variety of features offered by different KYC providers, a comprehensive comparison review would be extensive. However, I can provide a simplified comparison of the pricing plans and key features for a selection of KYC providers based on the information provided. Please note that some providers did not have pricing information available, and as such, they are not included in this comparison.

Please note that the prices and features are subject to change, and it's always best to contact the provider directly for the most current information and to discuss specific needs and potential discounts for volume or long-term contracts. Additionally, some providers offer custom solutions, which means that pricing is negotiated based on the specific requirements of the business.

For a more detailed comparison, including a full list of features and services, it would be necessary to conduct a deeper analysis and potentially reach out to each provider for the most up-to-date information.
