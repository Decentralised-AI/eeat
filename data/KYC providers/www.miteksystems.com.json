Customers want to trust\nbusinesses for their online transactions because they like their products or\nservices, or they feel an affinity for the brand and that the business will\nprotect their personal and financial details. On the other hand, companies\nestablish trust in their customers when they know them, which means that they\nhave been able to identify them and that they are who they present themselves\nto be, and not a fraudster impersonating a good customer.\n\nBut the need for this verification of identity goes even further: Companies,\nespecially financial entities, are obliged by regulatory bodies to comply with\nthe requirement to meet KYC (\u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d) \u2014 not just to avoid losses\ndue to fraud \u2014 but to prevent money laundering and the funding of terrorism,\namong other financial crimes \u2014 and ultimately, to protect society.\n\nSo how much does it cost to know your customer?\n\nTherefore, this verification of a customer\u2019s identity is both a strategic\nnecessity and a legal imperative. But this process, just like any other, comes\nat a price: How much does it cost to really get to know your customer?\n\nIt is with this question in mind that Consult Hyperion\u2019s newest study explores\n\u201cThe cost of compliance and how to reduce it.\u201d\n\nThe study examines some of the key elements that drive the costs associated\nwith KYC compliance, goes beyond just the process itself but also dives into\nareas like the following:\n\n\n\nInternal costs, external costs and sanctions\n\n**Internal costs** are those that are directly associated with the\nverification process, in systems as well as in staff and the office network\nwhere \u201chundreds, and in some cases thousands, of compliance staff are employed\nto monitor transactions, deal with alerts, work cases, phone customers, and\ndeal with false positives.\u201d The combined cost of staff and systems contributes\nthe highest cost to the equation. Consult Hyperion estimates, for a typical\nbank with 10M customers, a KYC programme can have internal costs of up to\n\u20ac25M.\n\n**External costs** can vary from country to country and includes costs like\naccess to the necessary databases for carrying out the KYC process. In this\ncase, the approximate cost is calculated at \u20ac5M.\n\nThe last two areas are the most difficult to predict or quantify for the\nentity but still represent very real costs. On the one hand, consider the\npossible sanctions in the event that the process fails or is not being applied\ncorrectly. And on the other, consider the cost of lost opportunities, that is,\nwhen potential customers leave the onboarding process due to the friction\ncaused by the identification process.\n\nIt is true that users will accept a certain degree of friction in the process,\nsince it will increase their perception of security. However, if the process\nis too slow or complex, they will most likely leave \u2014 for another entity.\n\nAccording to a study by Sapio, \"The Battle to Onboard 2 Research Report,\" the\nabandonment rates in an onboarding process can be staggeringly high, although\nthey do decrease significantly if the user can complete the process entirely\nonline:\n\nReduce compliance costs and diminish abandonment\n\nWith this lens, the Consult Hyperion study, \u201cThe cost of compliance and how to\nreduce it\u201d finds that with the right technology, financial entities can reduce\nthe costs of compliance with KYC requirements by up to 20%, and since\ndependence on manual verifications is reduced, it diminishes the cost of lost\nopportunities and there are fewer errors in complying with the standard, which\nin turn results in lower negative impact, both economically and with regard to\nconsumer trust.\n\nTo dive deeper into the real cost of KYC compliance and how to reduce it,\n**download the Consult Hyperion study, here**:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock your digital future.\n\n* * *\n\n## Navigation\n\n  * Solutions\n    * Products\n      * Identity verification platform\n      * Biometric authentication\n      * Mobile deposit\n      * Check fraud defender\n    * Technology\n      * Technology overview\n      * Mobile capture\n      * Identity verification\n      * Face liveness\n      * NFC authentication\n      * Check intelligence\n  * Use Cases\n    * Use cases\n      * Age verification\n      * Compliance (KYC)\n      * Customer onboarding\n      * Passwordless authentication\n      * Reusable identity\n      * Right to Work\n      * Sharing economy\n    * Industries\n      * Financial Institutions\n      * Fintech\n      * iGaming\n      * Lending\n      * Marketplace\n      * Travel\n  * Resources\n    * Resource library\n    * Blog\n    * Press releases\n    * Events & webinars\n    * Support\n    * In the news\n    * Guide: Modern KYC\n  * Innovators\n  * Company\n    * About us\n    * Careers\n    * Investor site\n    * Support\n    * Partners\n  * Contact us\n\n* * *\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Mitek Systems, Inc.\n\nTerms and Conditions | Privacy Policy | Admin\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your\ndevice to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our\nmarketing efforts.\n\nAccept All Cookies Reject All\n\nCookies Settings\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your\nbrowser, mostly in the form of cookies.
