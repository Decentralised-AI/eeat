Identity verification platforms help businesses verify customer\nidentities and assess fraud risks. This is especially important (and a legal\nrequirement) for financial institutions, which are highly regulated.\n\nThe KYC process builds trust between businesses and their customers,\nultimately benefiting both. By implementing robust identity verification\nprocesses at onboarding and developing an understanding of ongoing customer\nbehavior such as transaction patterns, businesses can spot suspicious\nactivities and prevent criminal activity such as money-laundering.\n\n## How do know your customer and know your business requirements differ?\n\nKnow your customer checks are conducted when a business wants to establish a\nbusiness relationship with an individual person. Know your business checks are\nconducted when they want to establish a business relationship with another\ncompany. KYB checks typically involve identifying the ultimate beneficial\nownership (UBO) in order to ascertain who might be benefiting from the\nfinancial activity of the business. They also often include identifying if a\nbusiness is subject to PEPs and sanctions checks, or has been linked through\nadverse media to illicit activity.\n\n## Is KYC a legal requirement?\n\nYes, KYC is a legal requirement in many industries. The financial services\nindustry is highly regulated with regulations applicable to starting new\ncustomer relationships as well as managing and monitoring customer accounts on\nan ongoing basis. Only through diligent and consistent KYC processes can these\norganizations counteract illegal activities like money laundering, corruption,\nand more.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), AML regulations are outlined in the terrorism act\n(2000), Proceeds of Crime Act (2002), and money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and transfer of funds regulations (2017). Additional regulations\nand guidance are related to biometrics regulation, cryptocurrency, and\nevolving AML rules.\n\n### European Union\n\nCompanies operating in the European Union (EU) must abide by regulations set\nforth in the Fifth and Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directives (also known as\n5AMLD, 6AMLD). Additional EU regulations concern AI best practices and AML\nreforms that have been developed to include specific guidance related to\nvarious use cases like gambling services and stringent remote identity\nverification procedures.\n\n### United States\n\nAs it relates to know your customer regulation, the Patriot Act of the United\nStates was designed to \u201cdeter and punish terrorist acts in the United States\nand around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and\nother purposes.\u201d While Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act doesn\u2019t represent\nthe origin of KYC regulations and compliance across the United States, it\ncertainly signifies an important development. The know your customer rule in\nthe USA Patriot Act requires that financial institutions enact safeguards\nagainst money laundering, terrorist financing, identity theft and other forms\nof fraud.\n\nUltimately, whether companies are operating in the UK, EU, US, or elsewhere,\nKYC requirements effectively serve to:\n\n  * Strengthen domestic measures for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting international money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n  * Subject foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are susceptible to criminal abuse to special scrutiny.\n  * Require all appropriate elements of the financial services industry to report potential money laundering.\n  * Strengthen measures to prevent the use of financial systems for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials (and facilitate repatriation of stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong).\n\nYou can learn much more about how Onfido empowers organizations to satisfy\nglobal compliance requirements in our global compliance manager\u2019s guide or EU\ncompliance manager\u2019s guide.\n\n## What are the benefits of knowing your customer?\n\nIn addition to compliance, the benefits of knowing your customer also include:\n\n  * **Fraud and money laundering prevention:** Robust KYC processes contribute to strong confidence regarding customer identity, helping to protect against exposure to threats like identity theft, as well as various types of financial crime \u2014 all of which can be costly to remedy once it\u2019s occurred. \n  * **Cost savings:** Comprehensive, properly-implemented KYC/AML processes help organizations avoid fines and other penalties that could have financially severe consequences. When these processes can be automated and digitized, they\u2019re even more cost-efficient.\n  * **Increased customer trust:** Many customers are savvy to the various threats the modern world presents, including the risk of identity theft or other forms of fraud. When organizations implement dependable solutions that mitigate those risks, customers will know they can trust working with them.\n\n## How does KYC prevent money laundering?\n\nAs mentioned above, one key objective of KYC adherence is detecting and\npreventing suspicious activity, including money laundering. Anti-money\nlaundering (AML) practices refer to specific procedures that financial\ninstitutions leverage to prevent criminal activities, such as any attempts to\ndeposit or transfer funds generated through illicit or illegal activities.\nWhen you consider the prevalence of financial fraud, the importance of AML in\nKYC is difficult to overstate.\n\nLike KYC compliance, international and local anti-money laundering regulations\nare required for certain business types. Ongoing monitoring and risk\nmanagement is crucial, since people can be sanctioned (or subject to\nrestrictions by authorities) after they have already started a banking\nrelationship. KYC and AML work hand-in-hand to set a framework for\norganizations to maintain legal compliance, protect customers\u2019 identities and\npersonal data, and prevent fraud. By adding identity verification at sign-up,\ncompanies can ensure customers are who they say they are from the start of\ntheir relationship, laying a strong foundation for future due diligence and\nongoing monitoring.\n\n## Why digitize KYC identity verification?\n\nThere are two primary ways to conduct KYC: a manual (paper-based) process or\nan online (digital) process \u2014 sometimes known as electronic know your customer\n(eKYC).\n\nAs you might expect, KYC started as a physical process but has since shifted\nto be mostly digital. Why the shift? It has a lot to do with the many\nchallenges of manual or offline KYC, which include:\n\n  * **Manual data entry** including information checks, error identification and correcting, and following up with clients or customers to collect additional information. These processes, when done manually, are exceptionally time-consuming and prone to human error.\n  * **High costs** including salary wages as well as the potential for hefty regulatory fines.\n  * **A poor customer/client experience** , driven by time-consuming processes that had to be completed in person.\n  * **Keeping up with industry regulations** , which are constantly evolving and being updated in the face of sophisticated new threats around identity theft and financial fraud.\n  * **Security threats** , including data breaches that can substantially erode client trust and result in hefty financial penalties for banks and other businesses.\n\n## What are the four key elements of KYC processes?\n\nThe four most important elements of a well-rounded and effective KYC/eKYC\nframework are:\n\n  1. Client/customer acceptance policies\n  2. Customer identification processes\n  3. Customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence\n  4. Ongoing monitoring/risk management\n\n### 1\\. Client/customer acceptance policies\n\nFinancial institutions and other organizations should outline client\nacceptance policies that determine the types of customer or client profiles\nthat present different levels of risk.\n\nFor example, an individual looking to open a modest, basic checking or savings\naccount may not pose too great a risk to the institution, so KYC requirements\nare likely to be less intensive than those for wealthy clients (or those with\ncomplex needs). A bank wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to apply extremely rigorous\nor lengthy review processes for these accounts \u2014 and doing so might drive\nclients away in frustration. KYC automation \u2014 which we\u2019ll cover a little later\n\u2014 expedites these processes without sacrificing accuracy. By contrast, though,\nif another client has a particularly high net worth or their source of their\nfunds is unclear, the financial institution would be wise to take a deeper\nlook at the client\u2019s financial picture in order to understand the potential\nrisks and how they may be mitigated.\n\n### 2\\. Customer identification programs\n\nWho are your customers? True to its name, customer identification involves a\nseries of steps designed to ensure that all customers or clients who do\nbusiness with a financial institution are who they say they are (and that\ntheir business is legitimate).\n\nIn the United States, financial institutions are required to uphold a Customer\nIdentification Program (CIP), a mandate enforced by the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the United States Department of the\nTreasury.\n\nFinCEN\u2019s CIP rule sets minimum requirements for onboarding new clients or\ncustomers. While these will vary somewhat depending on factors like the\norganization\u2019s size and geographic location, it should always include\nidentifying and verifying persons opening an account, organized and timely\nrecordkeeping, and comparison with government lists to spot any discrepancies.\n\n### 3\\. Customer due diligence\n\nCustomer due diligence (CDD) refers to a series of checks that work to verify\ncustomers\u2019 identities and understand their unique risk profiles. It becomes\nthe basis for any additional enhanced due diligence (EDD) that is necessary\nbased on the customer\u2019s risk profile.\n\n### 4\\. Ongoing monitoring and risk management\n\nIn the context of KYC, ongoing monitoring helps ensure that a company\u2019s\nunderstanding of its customer or user base remains consistent and accurate\nover time. Ongoing monitoring is designed to detect any reasons why a banking\ninstitution might be prohibited from doing business with certain customers \u2014\ndue to newly-applied sanctions, for example.\n\nIt also helps to protect company assets, provide a positive customer\nexperience, and remain in regulatory compliance. To put it in simple terms,\nongoing monitoring involves regularly revisiting steps one through three, as\ndescribed above. This way, companies can assess whether their client/customer\nacceptance policies, CIPs, or due diligence procedures need to be adjusted or\nupdated.\n\nWhen paired with ongoing monitoring, KYC/AML risk management helps ensure\ncompliance with local governments and regulators.\n\n## Can KYC/AML be automated?\n\nYes, many KYC/AML processes can \u2014 and should \u2014 be automated. When done right,\nautomation streamlines and speeds up onboarding and helps ensure ongoing\nmonitoring and compliance.\n\nOnfido\u2019s Real Identity Platform (powered by Atlas\u2122 AI) provides flexible, end-\nto-end identity verification \u2014 including document and biometric verifications,\ntrusted data validation, fraud detection and more.\n\n## What are the latest KYC compliance regulations?\n\nKYC regulations depend on industry and geography and are always changing \u2014\nlearn about the latest in our EU KYC requirements guide and global compliance\nmanager\u2019s guide to KYC.\n\n##  Ready to get started?\n\nOur identity experts are available to talk through your requirements, answer\nquestions, and set up a demo.\n\nContact us  Try for free\n\n**Onfido uses 256-bit SSL encryption 100% of the time on every device.**\n\nOnfido is SOC 2 Type II compliant.\n\nOnfido has been certified by BSI to ISO 27001 under certificate number IS\n660122.\n\n* * *\n\n  * Solutions\n    * Real Identity Platform\n    * Verification Suite\n    * Onfido Studio\n    * Onfido Atlas\n    * Smart Capture SDK\n  * Challenges we solve\n    * Compliance\n    * Customer acquisition\n    * Reducing cost of acquisition\n    * Fraud prevention\n  * Industries\n    * Financial services\n    * Gaming\n    * Healthcare\n    * Marketplaces & communities\n    * Retail & eCommerce\n    * Telecommunications\n    * Transport\n  * Our company\n    * About Onfido\n    * Why Onfido?\n    * Onfido partners\n    * Certifications\n    * Leadership\n    * Press\n    * Contact us\n    * Airside\n  * Resources\n    * Blog\n    * Supported documents\n    * Developer hub\n    * API reference\n    * Release notes\n    * Support\n    * Sign in\n\nFollow us\n\nBack to top\n\n* * *\n\n\u00a9 Onfido, 2023.
