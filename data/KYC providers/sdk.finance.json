Which one would you\nrecommend?\u201d  I certainly knew the difference between authentication and\nverification. But I couldn\u2019t have predicted how answering such a simple-\nsounding question would turn out to be more of a task than I imagined. So, now\nlet me walk you through my journey of discovery!\n\nTable of contents\n\n  * Steps to take before choosing a KYC vendor\n  * Key features to look for in a KYC software\n  * Top KYC providers comparison table\n  * KYC tools pricing\n  * API-first approach\n\n##  **Steps to take before choosing a KYC vendor**\n\n###  **Answer essential questions**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done your due diligence on Google and gained a general\nunderstanding of the KYC concept, procedures, and landscape plus compiled a\nlist of KYC providers that look trustworthy, ask yourself a few simple\nquestions before reaching out to their sales.\n\n  * What is the expected volume of onboardings per day?\n  * How big is the compliance department?\n  * What is the current automation-to-manual review ratio?\n\nWhen you feel you\u2019ve gained enough information here, embark on the second\nstage.\n\n### Cloud banking solution for an easy start\n\nAffordable cloud banking software to launch quickly and comply with all\nregulations\n\nLearn more\n\n###  **Prepare your requirements**\n\nPrior to your first call with KYC vendors, make sure you have the following\nlist prepared:\n\n  * _Requirements!_\n  * _Requirements!_\n  * _Requirements!_\n\nDo not talk to a prospective supplier without understanding your requirements.\nThis is wasting time, for both sides.\n\nUltimately, I shortlisted the following names: Mitek, Comply Advantage,\nTrulioo, Fenergo, Ondato.\n\n###  **Define key issues to handle via the KYC provider**\n\nDetermine the particular criteria to help make your choice. How would you\nmeasure up and compare different solutions?\n\nA potential KYC vendor should help resolve the following:\n\n  * **Improve the customer onboarding experience**\n  * Reduce onboarding and transactional fraud\n  * Diminish manual applications review time \n  * Decrease KYC costs\n  * Handle regulatory compliance\n\nSo, finding a solution that strikes a perfect balance between customer\nsatisfaction, risk management, and regulatory compliance isn\u2019t the easiest\ntask ever, right?\n\nLuckily, we can help.\n\n### Digital Wallet-as-a-Service platform\n\nAdd financial services to your product fast and for affordable price\n\nLearn more\n\n## Key features to look for in a KYC software\n\nThe KYC landscape is fairly competitive. Now, as fraudsters become more and\nmore sophisticated, KYC vendors are rushing to respond accordingly with\nsafeguard solutions.\n\nSo, how to find out that a particular KYC provider would be a perfect shield\nfrom fraudsters and bring you more customers \u2014 ultimately increasing the\nbottom line?\n\nAll KYC vendors are not made equal. Some have better coverage, for example,\nwhile others may have a better manual/automated review ratio.\n\nBut, bear in mind, if a vendor commits to coverage for a certain number of\ncountries, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that they can process all types of\navailable documents therein. So yes, the devil is again in the details.\n\nHere are the key aspects to consider prior to making a decision:\n\n  * **Security  \n**It goes without saying that you must be certain security is provided in a\nproper and appropriate fashion.\n\n  * **Perfect fit  \n**Depending upon your requirements, you may want to choose separate,\nindividual components like ID verification, or, you may want a more\ncomprehensive end-to-end solution covering KYC, AML, and anti-fraud. The key\npoint is to choose the solution that has the features and functionality which\nwould best fit the needs of your operations.\n\n  * **Easy integration  \n**APIs are the veins of the FinTech (not solely, of course). Make sure your\nvendor can offer hassle-free back-end and front-end integration which will\nreduce cost and time significantly.\n\n  * **Reference data connectivity  \n**Check whether the vendor has their own database. Normally, big-market\nplayers offer both their own database as well as the option to integrate other\nresources (e.g., governmental databases, integrated premium data sources,\ncustomer-specific data lists).\n\n  * **Technology** **used  \n**ML, AI, and biometrics.\n\n  * **Verification ability  \n**A simple way to evaluate a vendor\u2019s ability is by testing customers\u2019 data.\nTest the legitimate IDs as well as fake ones, expired, older, or different\nversions of an ID.  Do not forget to test the speed of manual reviews and\naudit the results.\n\n  * **Risk/conversion dilemma  \n**Obviously, the key question all financial institutions face is how to make\nthe onboarding easier, and for the institution itself to meet compliance\nrequirements. Try to investigate whether your solution can optimally balance\nbetween those two.\n\n### Banking software to build your own Revolut\n\nBuild your own neobank faster with SDK.finance Platform\n\nLearn more\n\nAsk your potential vendor how they would actually improve account and customer\nonboarding processes, and how it would reduce fraud and false positives.

Prices can also, in some cases,\nbe negotiable. You can compare pricing rates by contacting the above-mentioned\n\u201cknow your customer\u201d service providers directly.\n\n## API-first approach\n\nBeing a fintech vendor, we constantly emphasize the importance of an API-first\napproach \u2014 and metaphorically call it the new _\u2018_ electricity _\u2019_. It is the\nonly means by which to make a fast and cost-efficient integration, managing\nthe solution from one instance.\n\nAPIs add flexibility to your product development, save tons of time and\nbudget, and enable the creation of the most convenient applications for the\nend-users.\n\nEvery vendor displayed in the benchmarking sample can integrate front & back\nend as well as partners from adjoining fields like biometrics, online\nauthentication, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re building a banking or payment product, SDK.finance offers a powerful\ntransaction engine to cut down your development time and act as a foundation\nfor further developments.
