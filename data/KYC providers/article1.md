## Comparison with SEON.io

While both Signicat and SEON.io offer solutions for KYC and fraud prevention, they differ in their approach and offerings. SEON.io focuses on AI-powered fraud detection and prevention tools, offering features like email lookup, phone lookup, device fingerprinting, and IP lookup. On the other hand, Signicat provides a broader range of digital identity solutions, including identity proofing, trust orchestration, authentication, and electronic signing.

In terms of pricing, SEON.io offers a freemium model with a free plan and two paid plans. Signicat, however, offers a more complex pricing structure with different pricing plans for each product, catering to different user needs and budgets.

In conclusion, both SEON.io and Signicat provide robust solutions for KYC and fraud prevention. The choice between the two would depend on your specific needs, budget, and the specific features you require.
