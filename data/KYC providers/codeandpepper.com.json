It\u2019s impossible to sell a\nproduct or service without targeting it to a particular group. But how to\ndetermine who would be interested in spending their money on what you have to\noffer? One may just guess, but thorough research is always a better option.\nLet\u2019s find out how to do it effectively and **what KYC service providers**\n**to use in order to market successfully**.\n\n#### Table of contents\n\n  * What KYC is and why it\u2019s important\n  * Manual vs automated KYC\n  * Choosing a KYC solution provider\n  * Top KYC services providers\n  * Wrapping it all up\n\n## What is KYC and why it\u2019s more important than you might think\n\nKYC, a short for Know Your Customer, stands for one of the most important\naspects of marketing, especially in the case of FinTech and financial\nservices. The guidelines that KYC service providers can help create are\nnecessary to verify identity, suitability and risks involved with getting to\nthe customer and maintaining relationships with them. But that\u2019s not all. The\nofficial, main objective of them, is preventing the businesses from being used\nin money laundering activities. The global anti-money-laundering and anti-\nterrorism regulations are clear about that.\n\nIn fact, KYC service providers let you conduct an audit which is a mandatory\nprocess that all financial institutions must perform when they get a new\nclient and then periodically. Banks may even refuse to open an account or stop\na business relationship if the client/customer fails this check. It is\nespecially important in times of crisis, like right now, when criminals try\nexploiting people in need. During the initial KYC check, the financial company\nconfirms they know who is requesting the service and detects personalities who\ncan be potentially fake. It\u2019s more than just cybersecurity.\n\n## Manual or automated KYC?\n\nKYC can be done manually or automatically. In the first case, an employee of a\nfinancial institution has to personally check databases for information and,\nobviously, in the latter case it is done by specialised software.\nInterestingly, few of the checks are performed with dedicated, modern tools,\naccording to a survey conducted by knowyourcustomer.com. Whatever the reasons\nare, fact is there are serious delays in the digitalisation of KYC compliance.\n\n> In fact, a 2019 study by Know Your Customer (see graphic below) revealed\n> that 37% of surveyed compliance professionals still relied on a \u201cfully\n> manual\u201d or \u201cmostly manual\u201d customer onboarding and KYC process, while 29% of\n> respondents described their KYC procedures as \u201c50% automated and 50%\n> manual\u201d.\n>\n> Source: _https://knowyourcustomer.com/new-normal-kyc-compliance/_\n\n### How it\u2019s done\n\n**The general algorithm of how an automated KYC solution works is simple:**\n\n  1. Identification \u2013 when a customer creates an account on your platform\n  2. Drop-off \u2013 when the documents are uploaded for verification\n  3. Document checking\n  4. Optional \u2013 when there are problems with the documents, the system asks the customer to re-upload them two times. If the problems persist, manual verification is needed.\n  5. ID checking \u2013 verification if the customer\u2019s statement data and ID documents match\n  6. ALM-CFT screening \u2013 checking if the customer is on any list of politically exposed persons or on a santion list.\n  7. Payment \u2013 after everything is clear, the customer makes the payment\n\n## How to choose one of many KYC service providers\n\nBuilding a bespoke KYC solution is very expensive, time consuming and\nchallenging, only corporations and large scale companies do it on their own.\nThe rest of the market relies on ready-to-use technologies. But how to choose\nthe right one? After collecting a number of potential candidates, answer the\nfollowing questions.\n\n  * Not all providers are global. Does a chosen service support your country? \n  * Does the provider offer a sandbox environment?\n  * Where does the provider store the data? Some countries have data residency laws and require the servers to be located there (for example, the UAE.)\n  * What data aggregators does the provider use?\n  * Is it easy to integrate your systems with the service? Are there any technological limitations?\n\n##  Stay up to date with FinTech insights\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to receive curated content about all things tech &\nfinance.\n\nFirst Name  Business Email\n\nThank you for subscribing to our newsletter!\n\nForm submitting\u2026\n\nOops!
