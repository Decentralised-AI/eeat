Many financial services have switched to online, minimizing\nface-to-face interaction between clients and service providers, making\ncustomer verification increasingly essential to reduce fraud and other\nfinancial illegalities.\n\nFraud and money laundering are not the only issues that triggered the adoption\nof these regulatory requirements. Terrorist financing has become one of the\nparamount concerns, too, since money transfer channels may be used to finance\nterrorist activities. Consequently, apart from identity verification, it\nbecame crucial to estimate the purposes for which the clients are using the\nservice. That is why KYC procedures apply not only to banks but also to any\nfinancial institutions offering money transfer services, including online\nwallets, exchanges, brokerages, etc.\n\n### The KYC process\n\nThe main objective of the KYC process is to verify that the user is actually\nwho he says he is and to give them access to the services or products they\nneed. This verification can be conducted through different methods.\n\nThe KYC process usually involves collecting customer information such as name,\naddress, date of birth, and ID card number. It can also include biometric\nverification (most common for today \u2013 face or fingerprint verification).\n\nNext, the KYC information is compared against lists of individuals and\norganizations known to governments and law enforcement agencies to identify\nindividuals suspected of crime, detail which jurisdiction\u2019s international\nsanctions organizations or individuals are subject to, provide information on\nentities suspected of bribery or money laundering, and detect Politically\nExposed Persons (PEPs).\n\n## Types of KYC\n\nKnow Your Customer incorporates a variety of different practices and methods.\n\n  * KYB (Know Your Business) is an extension of KYC focusing on businesses rather than individuals. KYB is one of the critical practices to adopt if you are a financial institution dealing with companies, for instance, cryptocurrency exchanges.  \n\n  * CIP (Customer Identification Program) forms the basis of KYC and establishes guidelines for ensuring your customers are who they claim to be. CIP covers the basic data on the customer: name, date of birth, and address.  \n\n  * CDD (Customer Due Diligence) is the process of acquiring in-depth data about the customer, including career, business activity, and risk assessment. There are two types of customer due diligence processes: SCDD (Simplified Customer Due Diligence) and EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence), the latter mainly being triggered at high-risk and high-value transactions and individuals.  \n\n  * eKYC (Electronic KYC) refers to using digital technology and online services to enhance KYC. eKYC, or digital customer onboarding process, can effectively replace human work, checking documents and data against government records.  \n\n  * Sanctions screenings, or PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) checks, examine local and federal law databases to make sure that no dangerous individuals are involved.\n\n## Choosing a KYC solution provider: key parameters to consider\n\nSince the KYC environment is intensely competitive, KYC providers are rushing\nto offer their safeguard solutions, making it challenging to select the right\nservice provider. So how to choose a KYC provider that can secure effective\nprotection against fraudsters and help you drive more customers? We\u2019ve rounded\nup several key aspects to help you select the right KYC provider.\n\n### Jurisdiction\n\nEnsure that the particular KYC provider you are considering has direct access\nto local registries in the countries you work with and which documents they\ncan check there.\n\n### Regulation\n\nCarry out in-depth research into the legal field you operate in and identify\nthe KYC requirements you need to follow. The result of your investigation will\nhelp you shortlist KYC providers.\n\n### Language coverage\n\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that your customers\u2019 documents will likely be in\ndifferent languages, especially if you offer a global service. Your identity\nverification system will need to be able to analyze all the data in the same\nway, no matter the language, so don\u2019t forget to check this aspect with the KYC\nproviders you\u2019re considering.\n\n### Technology\n\nAnalyze what KYC providers you\u2019re considering can offer in terms of\ntechnology. Ideal KYC solutions should effectively fulfill two criteria:\nstreamline the customer onboarding process and ensure you meet relevant\nregulations.\n\n### Data storage\n\nRemember that some countries have data localization laws, meaning that records\nabout their residents and citizens are required to be stored in accordance\nwith the law. Ask your chosen KYC provider where their servers are located and\nin which ways they manage clients\u2019 data from such countries.\n\n### Databases\n\nAsk KYC providers to present you with a list of databases they are connected\nto. It is a positive sign if there are premium data sources, such as Thomson\nReuters or Dow Jones, as well as if there\u2019s the vendor\u2019s ability to integrate\nyour blocklists.\n\n### Integration\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that you\u2019ll need to integrate with your KYC provider via\nAPI, making a service provider that can offer you a solution a better choice.\n\n## Top KYC solution providers\n\nWe\u2019ve prepared a list of Top 6 KYC providers worth considering if you are\nlooking for an identity verification solution for your business.
