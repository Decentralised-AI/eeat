This often revolves around things\nlike contracts and invoices however more and more businesses are discovering a\nneed to manage and empower their digital activities which include a far wider\nrange of documents and files.\n\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for these processes to become complex as they evolve around\nchains of various legacy software which are not quite fit for purpose. What is\nneeded is a simple and affordable solution that is built for Compliance,\nPrivacy, Security and Visibility with a clearly verifiable audit trail.\n\nStart Now!\n\n###\n\n**KwikTrust Provides Just That.  **\n\nNot only does KwikTrust empower our users to create collaborative workspaces\nwhich are safe and secure, we make it easy to work with different\norganizations and clients as well. Our unique digital signing and data storage\nsolution also benefit from our partnership with IBM which leverages\nHyperledger Fabric. By integrating this permissioned blockchain solution\nKwikTrust is also able to scale our verification and validation to enterprise\nlevels.\n\nAll of this means that for any organization, no matter how big or small we\nhave a digital storage, signing and validation solution which is among the\nfastest and most affordable on the market.  \n\n## Testimonials\n\n\u201cAs a financial and a production accountant working in the film industry, I\nwork in regulated activities dealing with payroll, insurance and contracts. A\nlarge number of files have to be secured and shared, which is a concern when I\nhave to give third parties access to folders. This is a better solution than\nanything else I\u2019ve used as the files can\u2019t be tampered with.\u201d\n\nFiona Watson\n\nACCA FCCA\n\n## Meet the Team\n\nCEO\n\n\uf08c\n\n#### SIMON READ\n\nUniversity of Oxford, Blockchain Strategy Programme.
