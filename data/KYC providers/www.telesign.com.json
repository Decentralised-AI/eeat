Free trial\naccounts are best suited for developers and technical product managers who\nwant to test our APIs, SDKs, and services.\n\n### How does the free trial work?\n\nTrial users are given access to a unique API key and Customer ID, as well as\ncomplimentary test credits. These authentication credentials and testing\ncredits can be used to try any of the products listed in the trial account.\n\nThere are two ways that trial users can test Telesign products:\n\n  * With code: we provide code samples and SDKs in 7 different programming languages.\n  * Without code: we provide browser-based API Explorers that allow users to test APIs without writing any code.\n\nSign up for your free trial account (no credit card required) or learn more\nabout free trials.\n\n\n\n### How do I purchase a Sender ID (phone number) for sending SMS messages?\n\nTelesign offers a wide range of localized Sender IDs (or phone numbers for\nbusinesses to send and receive SMS messages) to our customers, such as toll-\nfree numbers (TFNs). Customers can purchase a Sender ID through their Telesign\naccount, where they can submit a request specifying their expected SMS use\ncases and desired delivery regions. Based on this information, our team\nprocures and registers a phone number that ensures brand recognition and\nexceptional delivery reliability.\n\n#### Solutions\n\n  * Engagement\n  * Account integrity\n  * Fraud Prevention\n  * Onboarding\n\n#### Products\n\n  * Digital identity\n    * Intelligence\n    * Phone ID\n  * Verification\n    * SMS Verify\n    * Silent Verification\n    * Verify Plus\n  * Omnichannel API\n    * SMS API\n    * RCS API\n    * WhatsApp API\n    * Viber API\n  * Phone Numbers\n  * Number Masking\n  * Voice API\n\n#### Learn\n\n  * Blog\n  * Resources\n  * Customers\n  * Events\n  * Glossary\n\n#### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Press\n  * Careers\n  * Partners\n  * Product Partnership\n\n#### Pricing\n\n  * SMS and Voice\n  * Verification\n  * Intelligence\n  * Identity\n  * Numbers and sender IDs\n\n  * \u00a9 2023 Telesign \n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * Business Conduct Policy\n  * Supplier Code of Conduct\n  * California Collection Notice\n  * Data Privacy Framework Notice\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\nThis site is registered on wpml.org as a development site.\n\n"
