It means that a good number of financial\norganizations, those who are still conducting KYC checks in a \u201cfully manual\u201d\nor \u201cmostly manual\u201d way, jeopardize their stakeholders.\n\nIn its survey, Know Your Customer mentions that only **29%** of respondents\ndescribed their KYC procedures as \u201c **50%** automated and **50%** manual\u201d.\n\nRobust user-friendly KYC solution compliant with industry standards is a\ntoday\u2019s challenge for the majority of banks, Fintech startups and crowdfunding\ncompanies. Finding the right KYC provider is a daunting task, but at the end\nof the day, you save your reputation and clientele.\n\nHerein, we\u2019re discussing top KYC providers for Fintech businesses operating\naround the globe.\n\n## What you will learn:\n\n  1. Transforming client onboarding operations with online KYC providers\n  2. Best KYC providers you should look at\n  3. KYC providers in Europe and the Americas\n  4. KYC providers in Africa\n  5. Online KYC providers: how to choose yours\n  6. LenderKit \u2014 crowdfunding software with integrated due diligence checks\n\n##  **Transforming client onboarding operations with online KYC providers**\n\nThe boom of online activity and mobile transactions works out well for\nfraudsters wanting to capitalize through phishing schemes, bribery and\ncorruption.\n\nAnd for financial service providers, identifying suspicious clients are\nbecoming more and more complex.\n\n\u201cDo You Know Your Customer or Business?\u201d regulators keep asking this question\nto prevent incumbents from Danske Bank-like scandals.\n\nKYC and KYB checks are essential parts of onboarding processes. Despite being\nhigh-priced and annoying the clients, customer due diligence (CDD) processes\nare still high-priority.  \n\nKPMG reports that in **2018** KYC & AML frameworks were among top areas of\nresource and budget spent.\n\nSource: KPMG\n\nDuring the initial **KYC check** , the financial company confirms they know\nwho is requesting the service and detects personalities who can be potentially\nfake.\n\n **KYB** check is more complex. Banks and Fintechs have to investigate a\ncorporate client from various angles: the nature of the business, activity\nrecords and company\u2019s story, its stakeholders and their personalities.\n\nNon-compliance with KYC expected standards can lead to high fines and even\nworse consequences such as:\n\n  * inappropriate client experience and the necessity to rework/revise CDD processes;  \n  * strict governmental supervision and prolonged investigations;\n  * damaged reputation and low-performance indicators;\n  * high cost of issue fixing.\n\nAll of this can be avoided only if a financial organization rebuilds the\nexisting onboarding process with KYC elements.\n\nAccording to Accuity, the transformation of the onboarding process built upon\nthree pillars\u2014 **people** , **programmes** and **processes** \u2014 will help you\nachieve the goal.\n\nREAD FURTHER  What is the difference between KYC and AML?\n\nAs for processes, the main challenges here are to get quality data for all\ntypes of clients (individual, corporate and institutional) and managed it in\nan appropriate way to detect the credibility of the latter.\n\nEarlier, different people from several departments would fulfil these tasks.\nToday, one single tech solution can do this job, faster and more accurately.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem \u2013 to find the KYC solution provider that will be your\nperfect match.\n\n##  **Best KYC providers you should look at**\n\nWhen preparing the content for this post, we\u2019ve looked through the list of KYC\nproviders which are popular across different geo zones: Europe, UK, US, Saudi\nArabia, UAE, African countries.\n\nThere are literally tons of options with similar features over there.
