KYC / AML guidelines are\nincluded in the mandated merchant onboarding process to ensure compliance to\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Combating Financing\nof Terrorism (CFT) guidelines.\n\nThe EU member states implemented the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive to\ntighten the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations towards\nanonymous issuing of electronic money products in the beginning of 2020; not\nmore than 150 euros can be issued anonymously electronically online, cash\nredemption amount is limited to 50 euros etc.\n\n## Application of KYC\n\nPSPs are responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of companies using their\nservices and will not harm any party\u2019s financial conditions or reputation.\nPSPs have the right to reject providing services to any suspicious business\nentities. KYC is usually included in the merchant onboarding process of PSPs.\nEach PSP establishes different KYC policies. During most of the KYC\nprocedures, PSPs will verify certain information of the business/ individual.  \n\n  * Company Registration & Beneficiary Documents - documentation issued by relevant jurisdictions, shareholder registration and statement on the actual beneficiaries, individual KYC and certified proofs of identity of real beneficiaries and directors (document proofs of their identities, address, organizational structure etc.)\n  * Terms of Conditions - Online point of sale contract signed by your customers\n  * Business Plan - For a start up company with no commercial history, business plan will be required.\n  * Bank Account Details - Details of the bank accounts that will process transactions using PSPs\n\nPSPs should audit the whole paying processes of its merchants to ensure fast\nand safe client experience with clear terms and conditions.\n\n## Blockpass offers a user-centric, digital KYC solution that is quick, simple\nand free to integrate.\n\nhe Blockpass Mobile App is able to prove a user\u2019s identity instantly whilst\ntheir data remains under their control \u2013 allowing them to use it to verify\npassports, driving licenses or other documentation that particular hospitality\nservices may require.

Future developments will involve adding reputation to\nusers for any manner of reason, allowing them to build up a reputation which\nhas been verified by others \u2013 a particularly useful feature as we see an\nincrease in business models where individuals offer services such as with Uber\nand AirBnB.
