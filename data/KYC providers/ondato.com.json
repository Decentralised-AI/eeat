Regulators enforce the Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure to\nensure companies know who they are dealing with. KYC compliance requirements\nare strict and ever-changing. As a result, no organization should take it\nlightly. Otherwise, they risk getting penalized or ruining their reputation.\nWhile many institutions continue to use manual processes to manage KYC data,\nothers choose to collaborate with KYC service providers.  The KYC service,\npowered by the latest technological advancements, can enhance the speed,\nefficiency, and cost-effectiveness of your compliance strategy. These\nadvantages, however, are only guaranteed if you choose the right provider.\n\nStay in the loop with the latest industry news\n\nThousands of subscribers already joined our monthly mailing list to receive\nthe latest news, updates and insider information on our product.

It is especially\nuseful for large-scale organizations with a large customer base, such as\nbanks.\n\nKYC is required for the following institutions:\n\n  * Banks and financial institutions\n  * Insurance companies\n  * Brokerages that offer investment advice and trade securities on behalf of others\n  * Online gaming and live streaming\n  * Gambling services\n  * Alcohol industry\n  * Travel sector\n  * Money transfer businesses\n  * Crypto industry\n\nMany other industries, including new and emerging sectors, are subjected to\ncompliance obligations.\n\n## What Is KYC Software and How Does It Aid in Regulatory Compliance?\n\nKYC software is a tool that aids in the onboarding process for businesses. It\ncan help with the identification of customers, background checks, and other\nprocesses such as customer data management.\n\nKYC software is designed to help with compliance and regulatory requirements,\nas well as to automate the onboarding of customers and clients.\n\n## How to Pick the Right KYC Service Provider?\n\nPicking a KYC service provider is not an easy task. However, several steps\nmake the process more efficient.\n\n### Establish Your Compliance Needs\n\nTo choose the right KYC service provider, first prepare your compliance\nstrategy. A well-established strategy allows you to understand your precise\ncompliance needs. If you already know what your compliance process should look\nlike or if you have it in place, you can move on to evaluating providers.\n\nHowever, a problem may arise if you have just started a regulated business and\nare working on the strategy from scratch. In this case, you can contact a\nprofessional compliance specialist to figure it out.\n\nMany different platforms are available for use today, but not all of them work\nfor every company. Some companies may have existing systems that need updating\nor upgrading; others may need something completely new.\n\nThe best place to start when finding out what kind of platform would be best\nsuited for you is by talking with experts in the field who can give advice\nbased on their experience with different types of companies and their unique\nneeds.\n\n### Figure Out Your Options and Get to Know Who You Are Working With\n\nWhen a compliance strategy is ready, it\u2019s time to do market research. The\ncompliance software market is booming. More and more new providers are joining\nthe ranks with their services. For this reason, it may be challenging to pick\nthe one that best fits your needs.\n\nGetting to know their businesses is the best way to know which ones are worth\nyour attention. Take the time to get to know who you are working with. Don\u2019t\nhesitate to visit the provider\u2019s website, social media accounts, and check the\nreviews of the company. You can also ask other customers for references. If\nyou get the chance, don\u2019t hesitate to schedule calls with the company\u2019s\nrepresentatives or chat them up at conferences.\n\n### Is the KYC Service Provider Certified?\n\nCertification and accreditation are verification processes performed by an\nindependent third party. The process determines whether the KYC service\nprovider meets specific requirements for competence, experience, and\nintegrity.\n\nMany financial institutions will only work with accredited service providers\nbecause it gives them confidence that a company is providing the right\nexpertise and credibility to its clients.\n\nThe following are some of the advantages of using an accredited KYC service\nprovider:\n\n  * Risk of noncompliance with regulatory requirements is reduced.\n  * Greater assurance that all customer data is securely stored and easily accessible if regulators or law enforcement agencies require it.\n  * Application of cutting-edge technological innovations  \n\n### Customer Support Availability\n\nThe availability of support staff is important for the success of your\norganization. Support teams with extensive knowledge and experience can help\nyou avoid common mistakes and give you a better understanding of how to\nintegrate compliance into your business model.\n\nWhen choosing a KYC service provider, look at the number of support staff\navailable to help with queries. Some companies may have separate departments\nfor different types of queries, such as customer service or technical support,\nwhile others may only offer one line for all types of queries. This will\ndepend on the company\u2019s size and whether it has embraced a digital approach in\nits operations.\n\n### How Flexible Is the Provider\u2019s System?\n\nWhen choosing a KYC system, you\u2019ll want to look at the service provider\u2019s\nflexibility. You need to be sure that their system can adapt as your business\ngrows and changes. This means that it must be able to scale and provide access\nto the data you need for onboarding purposes or when making decisions about\nrisk management. For instance, if you\u2019re planning to onboard both natural\npersons and legal entities, check if the provider offers a Know Your Business\nprocedure.\n\n### Do They offer Coaching and Training?\n\nIn addition to providing access to the software, you want your KYC provider to\nbe able to provide coaching and training. You may not only need assistance\nwith how to use the software but also help with your compliance strategy as a\nwhole. Finally, the provider should be able to provide support and training so\nthat both parties are clear on expectations from each other.\n\nAt a minimum, they should be able to advise on key areas such as:\n\n  * The compliance landscape in your industry and how it applies to your business.\n  * How to identify and mitigate risk when providing services or products.\n  * The regulatory environment in which you operate (e.g., Anti-Money Laundering regulations, Know Your Customer requirements).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPicking a KYC service provider may seem like a daunting task. With a saturated\ncompliance software market, it\u2019s easy to overlook a great service. Start by\nsetting up a great compliance strategy and assessing your needs to ensure you\nget exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Then do your research and get to know the\nproviders. Once you have your options, analyze each one\u2019s platforms. Check\ncertification, customer support availability, and flexibility. Don\u2019t forget to\nevaluate relevant tools and look for coaching services. This way, you\u2019ll pick\nthe best provider for your business needs.\n\nPublished October 18, 2022\n\nWords by Ondato\n\nShare article\n\nPublished October 18, 2022\n\nWords by Ondato\n\nShare article\n\n## Related articles\n\n### Structuring in Money Laundering  \n\nRead more\n\n### Digital Onboarding: What is it and How Does it Work?\n\nRead more\n\n### IRDAI Regulation Introduces Insurance KYC Guidelines\n\nRead more\n\ngo to blog\n\n## Stay in the Loop with Our Latest News\n\n\u0394\n\n#### Streamline your digital KYC with Ondato\n\nGet in Touch\n\nOndato is a tech company that streamlines KYC and AML-related processes using\ncutting-edge AI solutions tools that cover the full spectrum of compliance\nchallenges, from new client onboarding to a comprehensive database for ongoing\nclient monitoring.\n\nSolutions\n\nIdentity Verification (KYC)\n\nBusiness Onboarding (KYB)\n\nCustomer Data Platform (CDP)\n\nTransaction Monitoring (KYT)\n\nDue Diligence\n\nAuthentication\n\nVirtual Branch\n\nAML Software\n\nModules\n\nAutomated Identity Verification\n\nVideo Identity Verification\n\nManual Identity Verification\n\nNFC Identity Verification\n\nAutomated Business Onboarding\n\nAssisted Business Onboarding\n\nManual Business Onboarding\n\nE-Signature Authentication\n\nSecure Remote Meetings\n\nBiometric Authentication\n\nAge Verification\n\nSMS Signature\n\nSanctions Screening and Monitoring\n\nResources\n\nBlog\n\nPress Page\n\nFAQ\n\nCase studies\n\nPricing\n\nKnow Your Customer Plans\n\nKnow Your Business Plans\n\nOfficer Platform Plans\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\n\nPartnerships\n\nCareers\n\nContact\n\n\u00a92023 Ondato.
