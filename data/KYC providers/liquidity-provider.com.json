    "summary": "# Top 5 Most Reliable KYC Technology Providers\n\nJan 24, 2023\n\n__ __ __\n\n__ __ __\n\nThe development of trade in the financial sector has contributed to the\ncreation of numerous financial markets that offer incredible opportunities for\nenrichment. At the same time a lot of fraudulent organizations have appeared\nwhich try in every possible way to steal the money of people engaged in\ntrading on the market. In order to prevent crime in the field of trading and\ninvesting, KYC technology was created, which is provided by the so-called KYC\nproviders.  \n  \nThis article will talk about who KYC providers are and why KYC technology\nplays an important role in digital business. At the end you will find the top\n5 most reliable KYC providers to make your business safer.\n\n###  What is a KYC Provider?\n\nKYC (\"Know Your Customer\") is used to identify and authenticate users before\nconducting financial transactions or investing in projects. This procedure is\nfollowed by most centralized services and less often in decentralized finance.\nKYC providers, in turn, act as companies that provide access to KYC tools and,\nat the same time, are the intermediaries between users and projects, taking\ncare of the safety of user data and compliance with all necessary AML\nprocedures including.  \n  \nKYC technology is used in many areas of the financial environment, but it is\nparticularly popular in the field of DeFi. The DeFi space goes beyond the\nlegal field and for this reason, identity verification is less common in the\ndecentralized space. User data is collected by those platforms and venues that\nlaunch their products within certain jurisdictions or interact with users from\ncertain countries. With increased regulatory scrutiny, many projects have\nbegun to require compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, of which\nKYC is a part.  \n  \nMany projects that raise funds and conduct pre-sales of tokens, as well as a\nnumber of exchanges and other fintech companies, use third-party solutions\n(KYC providers) to collect investor data. With the development of DeFi and the\ngrowing popularity of new models for fundraising, a significant number of\nplatforms have emerged that provide data collection services. The advantage of\nsuch services is the possibility of identity management. Users provide the\nnecessary documents and pass biometric checking once, and then can choose\nwhich project or platform to provide access to personal information.  \n  \n**KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n\nKYC providers are the intermediaries between users and companies who want to\nensure the security of their users' data, including the use of AML technology.\n\nKYC technology is used in many areas of the financial environment, but it is\nparticularly popular in the field of DeFi.\n\nKYC is used to verify the identity of the user, including in conjunction with\nAML procedures.  \n  \n\n###  The Value and Importance of KYC Technology in Digital Business\n\nThe KYC procedure is borrowed from the sphere of banking and stock exchange\nregulation and plays an important role in providing security for trading and\ninvesting. It is ideal for financial institutions, betting shops, and any\nother companies dealing with private money. This action means that before\nconducting a financial transaction, specialists must identify the counterparty\nand the source and recipients of the funds in order to determine the\nlegitimacy of the operations. This practice prevents money laundering,\nterrorist financing, and tax evasion, and thus increases the overall security\nof exchanges' interactions with users.  \n  \nVerification procedures may differ depending on the nature of the business,\nbut they have the same goals. The main stages of the procedure are data\ncollection and verification. This also includes due diligence and continuous\nuser monitoring. KYC verification usually consists of 3 parts:  \n  \n_Customer Identification Program (CIP)_  \n  \nThis is the first and most unambiguous part of KYC. It consists of the usual\ncollection and verification of customer information. Banks usually do it\nduring the registration process. Cryptocurrency exchanges and other\ninstitutions, whose requirements are not as strict, start the procedure after\nregistration.  \n  \n_Customer Due Diligence (DD)_  \n  \nSometimes, after verification, a company decides on an additional customer\nbackground check. Its purpose is risk assessment. If the client has been\nimplicated in financial scams or has been investigated in the past, this\nbecomes known during the background check.  \n  \n_Continuous Monitoring_  \n  \nContinuous monitoring ensures that the verification data is always up to date\nand allows the system to closely analyze suspicious transactions. The\nprocedure allows the tracking of large transactions to countries implicated in\nterrorism, according to the U.S. government. Depending on the results of the\ninvestigation, the exchange may suspend the account and report the problem to\nregulatory and law enforcement authorities.  \n  \n**FAST FACT**\n\nPassing the KYC procedure is a prerequisite for working with any financial\ninstitution in any financial markets.  \n  \n\n###  Top 5 KYC Providers You Should Consider for Your Business\n\nNow that you know who the KYC providers are and what role the KYC procedure\nplays in the digital business, it's time to get to know the top 5 most\nreliable companies that provide this technology.  \n  \n**1\\.
