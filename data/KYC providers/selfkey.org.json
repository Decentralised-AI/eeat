In this article we walk you through our newest\naddition.\n\n13 May 2020\n\nSelfKey\n\nSelfKey Protocol is maintained by a DAO of SelfKey iD Holders. Join us and\nhelp revolutionize identity management in Web3!\n\nJOIN SELFKEY DAO\n\nYou may have noticed a new addition to the SelfKey Wallet - the Exchanges\nMarketplace! We\u2019re delighted to bring you a comprehensive crypto exchange\nmarketplace where you can compare different exchange accounts and sign up\ninstantly.\n\nIn this article, we walk you through our newest Marketplace and all of the\ngreat exchanges that are listed. Here\u2019s how to get started.\n\nDisclosure: Some of the links in this article are affiliate links; we may\nreceive a commission for purchases made through these links at no cost to you.\n\n# How to open a crypto exchange account\n\nWe specifically designed this process to be as easy for you, the user, as\npossible. Our aim is to provide clarity and transparency throughout the entire\nuser experience, and you\u2019ll see how that is reflected in our process.\n\n## Step 1: Download the Wallet\n\nThe SelfKey Identity Wallet is free, open-source and designed to keep your\ntokens safe. That being said, it offers a lot more than a simple\ncryptocurrency wallet. Instead it allows you to manage your identification\ndocuments and provides access to the Self!Key Marketplace where you can open\nbank accounts, incorporate your business abroad, and more.\n\nHead over to this page and download the wallet on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX.\nYou can also download the SelfKey Wallet on your smartphone by visiting the\nabove page. Whether you\u2019re on your computer or your phone, the wallet is free\nand light-weight, meaning you\u2019ll thoroughly enjoy using it. Of course, you own\nyour private keys and can even access the Wallet using Ledger and Trezor.\n\n## Step 2: Set up your Wallet\n\nSetting up your wallet couldn\u2019t be easier, but it\u2019s a very important step. As\na result, it\u2019s vital to make sure you do it correctly. The first thing you\nneed to do is securely store your public and private keys. As a non-custodial\nWallet, SelfKey cannot recover your private key, so make sure you don\u2019t lose\nit.\n\n## Step 3: Complete your SelfKey ID (optional)\n\nOnce the Wallet is downloaded and your keys are securely stored, the next step\nis to set up your SelfKey ID. This is a collection of locally stored Know Your\nCustomer (KYC) information used to quickly access new service providers.\nThanks to the SelfKey ID, you can reuse the same KYC data multiple times. So\ninstead of having to go through many different sign-up processes within the\nMarketplace, you simply complete your SelfKey ID once and then use it whenever\nyou need it.\n\nThis feature will be coming soon to our Exchanges Marketplace. Once it is in\neffect, if you want to join multiple crypto exchanges, you simply complete\nyour SelfKey ID once and then use it for all registrations.\n\n## Step 4: Find your preferred exchange\n\nNow that your SelfKey ID is set up, it\u2019s time to head to the SelfKey\nMarketplace and check out the different crypto exchanges on offer. When logged\ninto the Wallet, click on the Menu in the top right of your screen and select\n\u201cMarketplace\u201d.\n\nSix different Marketplaces should now appear, with one clearly being for\nexchanges. Click on the button to see a screen similar to this one:\n\nTo learn more about each, make sure to click on \u201cDetails\u201d and peruse the\nindividual listing pages. We\u2019ve endeavoured to give you all the relevant\ninformation, but please make sure to do your own research as well.\n\nHere you can see an example for one of our exchanges, Bitpanda:\n\nAs you will be able to see, information such as exchange location, fees, if\nKYC is required, excluded residents, if fiat currencies are accepted, and\nmore, are all clearly laid out. This way it\u2019s easy to see which exchanges meet\nany criteria you have, and which exchanges you are eligible to join.\n\n## Step 5: Sign up\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which exchange you\u2019d like to join, simply click on the\n\u201cSign Up\u201d button on the top right. From there, you\u2019ll be directed to the\nexchange\u2019s website where you\u2019ll need to register for a new account and follow\nthe instructions they provide. You may need to confirm your identity for KYC\npurposes, so make sure to have a piece of government-issued ID on hand.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, you\u2019re all signed up for your new crypto account!\n\n# Featured crypto exchanges\n\nWe have over twenty different crypto exchanges listed in our Exchanges\nMarketplace.
