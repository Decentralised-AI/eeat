Tap into our platform and access tons of\nidentification methods and international identity data sources to create an\nautomated KYC/KYB process.\n\nEliminate the burden of managing multiple vendors, reduce costs by minimising\nthe amount of manual work, and maximise your conversion rate for onboarding\nnew customers.\n\n  * Talk to a digital identity expert \n\n##  68% of European consumers abandoned onboarding\n\nLearn why, and what financial institutions can do about it.\n\nRead the Battle to Onboard 2022 report\n\n##  AML driven KYC and KYB\n\nAML, KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) refer to the\nobligation of regulated entities such as financial service providers, real\nestate brokers, cryptocurrency providers, accountants, and law firms, to\nidentify their customers and assess their associated risks for money\nlaundering on an ongoing basis. They must report to the authorities (FIUs) if\nthey find suspicious activities. International Anti-money laundering (AML)\nregulations drive KYC and KYB checks. With the introduction of the 6th AML\ndirective, the requirements are more detailed than before and better aligned\nacross borders.\n\nStill, many regulated entities struggle to comply with AML driven KYC and KYB\npractices. They already have a hard time handling anti-money laundering\nmeasures themselves, let alone automating related processes.\n\n##  A challenging task that never ends\n\nAccording to a 2020 survey report from Deloitte, reliance on manual processes\nand poor quality/inadequate data were among the top challenges for banks when\nmanaging an AML compliance programme. Even 62% of the respondents indicated\nthat insufficient/outdated technology to manage AML compliance obligations was\nthe biggest AML compliance challenge they faced. This corresponds to what we\nsee as major challenges in the market regarding AML driven KYC and KYB\npractices:  \n\n  * How to handle the trade-off between compliance and conversion rates?\n  * How to create a trustworthy automated solution that limits the amount of manual work and reduces costs?\n  * How to create a compliant solution that adapts to the ever-evolving local best practices and international requirements of AML?\n  * How to manage multiple technology suppliers that deliver \u201ca piece to the puzzle\u201d of AML compliance and KYC/KYB activities?\n\n##  Save costs\n\nCurious how we partnered with major Dutch bank Rabobank and helped them save\nmore than EU 500K?\n\nDiscover how\n\n##  What are typical KYC and KYB activities?\n\nOn a high level, KYC and KYB processes consist of 4 core activities:\n\n  * 1\\. Customer identification\n\n\u2193\n\nHere, details that uniquely identify the customer (such as name and\nidentification number) are retrieved from the customer and verified against\n_reliable source_ s. In addition, the person \u201con the other side of the screen\u201d\nis identified _on remote_ \\- is the person really who the person claims to be?\nYou validate that this is an existing person and you validate that the person\nis present.\n\n  *   * 2\\. Core Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)\n\n\u2193\n\nDuring this step, extra customer information is retrieved from reliable\nsources which serve as input to the next step, the risk assessment.\n\n    * For KYC, examples of this step are verifying an address against a _reliable source_ or screening the person for the politically exposed person (PEP) and sanction status. \n    * For KYB, an organisation\u2019s ownership-, control structure and UBOs (ultimate beneficial owners) must be established and verified against _reliable sources_. \n    * For both KYC and KYB, the source of funds and wealth also need to be verified.\n    * For EDD, more in-depth information must be retrieved from a _reliable source_ _._\n\n  *   * 3\\. Risk assessment\n\n\u2193\n\nThe previously collected information is reviewed, and the customer's risk\nprofile is established. Risk can be influenced by many different parameters:\ncustomer entity type/structure, type of offered product, field of industry,\ncountry, PEP/sanction status, and transparency and reputation.\n\n  *   * 4\\. Ongoing monitoring\n\n\u2193\n\nKYC and KYB are not one-time activities that only need to be performed during\n_onboarding_. Customer information and risk must be kept up to date on an\nongoing basis, requiring changes in previously retrieved data to be\n_monitored_. In addition to the KYC and KYB data, financial transactions also\nneed to be monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\n  * \n\n##  That's a lot to cover... tap into the Signicat platform!\n\nWith our comprehensive platform, you can automate the KYC/KYB processes that\ncover core activities 1, 2, 3 and 4. You get access to tons of digital\nidentification methods and international identity data sources to comply with\nAML regulations. All the tools you need to build a solution that covers your\nbusiness's local and international needs. Eliminate **** the burden of\nmanaging multiple vendors, reduce costs by minimising the amount of manual\nwork, and start to maximise your conversion rates for onboarding new\ncustomers.  \n\n  * Reliable identity data sources\n\n\u2193\n\nSignicat offers a comprehensive range of reliable identity data sources on our\nplatform, ranging from _electronic identities_ (eIDs) in our eID Hub, _ID-\ndocument   and biometric verification services_ ( _eIDV_ _)_ , and _national\nand  commercial registries _. We can advise you on which sources to use based\non your (1) risk-based approach, (2) applicable regulation(s), (3) desired\nend-user convenience and (4) costs.\n\n  *   * Remote identification\n\n\u2193\n\nSignicat offers different remote identification solutions. The most convenient\none is without doubt an electronic identity or eID. Electronic IDs have been\ncreated by national governments and banks, providing verified identity data.\nOur platform offers integration to more than 30 eIDs covering most European\ncountries. The end-user simply logs in using an app or mobile phone and can\nshare their verified data with your company.\n\nAlternatively, Signicat offers Electronic Identity Document and biometric\nverification services (eIDV). High-quality services to securely scan ID\ndocuments to obtain verified identity data, compare facial patterns between\nthe picture in the ID, using live video, and the document holder (holder\nverification), and do liveness checks to avoid identity fraud. Our platform\ngives you access to all leading eIDV techniques: video-based, image-based, NFC\ntechnology, and 3D face match.  \n\nEach method has its own level of assurance. Signicat can help you evaluate and\nchoose the right method for your business needs.  \n\n  *   * Risk and Identity Data sources\n\n\u2193\n\nSignicat connects you to trusted national and international data sources,\nwhich you can use to:\n\n    * Verify identity information provided by the user \n    * Enrich user and organisation data \n    * Ensure AML/KYC compliance \n\nFor businesses, our API can provide information from local and international\nregistries, such as basic information, roles, ownership structure, UBO,\nscreening, authorizations and financial information..\n\nFor consumers or business-related persons, our API can provide information\nfrom local and international registries such as address, basic information,\nfinancial information, address verification, and bank account holder checks.\n\n  *   * KYC and KYB monitoring\n\n\u2193\n\nSignicat offers convenient APIs to _monitor changes_ in the data sources on\nour platform.
