Price too high\nand pressure grows to secure a high volume of sales to protect profits. Price\ntoo low and risk damaging perception of the product, service, or brand \u2013 along\nwith margins.\n\nTo find the optimum yet competitive price, your pricing strategy needs to\nbalance buyer expectations, budgets, perceived value, and internal and\nexternal influences. With so many factors at play, purpose-built analytics can\noffer decision makers a lifeline.\n\nAdvanced analytics can generate pricing recommendations based on competitor\ninsights, evolving market trends, real-time sales velocities, customer\nbehaviors, and changing market conditions.\n\nWhen decision makers take automated insights into their hands, they can apply\ntheir knowledge and experience to take swift, decisive action. The result \u2013\naugmented intelligence \u2013 is a blend of machine intelligence and human judgment\nthat guides decision makers toward the ideal price at any point in time.\n\n## Harnessing the power of pricing analytics\n\nPricing analytics can reduce risk, boost sales, and increase margins \u2013 even in\nthe face of market disruption. In fact, with effective pricing, enterprises\ncan often improve profit margins by at least 0.5\u20131%. So, what does this look\nlike in practice?\n\nOne aviation leader identified a $30 million margin gap against target. The\ncompany had previously set prices for its spare parts without considering the\nconnections between prices, buyers, and perceived value. Working with Genpact,\nthe company found that its customers would make buying decisions based on how\nthey use, consume, and replace different parts. This formed the basis for the\ncompany's decision to map part pricing against perceived customer value. With\nthis approach, the company formalized a pricing strategy, created trackable\npricing lists, and developed a dynamic pricing model that resulted in a $60\nmillion margin improvement.\n\nSimilarly, an oil field services provider didn't have a standard list of\nprices for its products, rentals, and services. This led to disparity across\ncustomer quotes and negative perceptions about the company's pricing. Genpact\nhelped the company build machine learning-based algorithms to generate\nstandardized prices according to region and product. Supported by advanced\nvisualization dashboards, the company improved profit margins by 2\u20133%.\n\n## Mastering your pricing analytics strategy\n\nAs you begin to look at your own pricing strategy and analytics capabilities,\nthere are many different areas to consider. Based on our experiences, we\nbelieve these are the highest priority:\n\n  1. **Define success:** There's no single price that will deliver optimal results across all KPIs. So, you need to determine and prioritize the KPIs that are the greatest indicators of success or most relevant to your business objectives.\n  2.  **Price by customer segments:** In a perfect world, pricing would be optimized for each individual customer. But that can lead to errors and discrepancies, especially if customers share quotes. To find a balance, segment customers with pricing personalized to each group.\n  3.  **Segment dynamically:** Remember that customers tend to shift between segments over time. If you consider the customer journey in your pricing strategy, you're more likely to secure customer loyalty as they move from early adopters to frequent buyers.\n  4.  **Implement lifecycle pricing:** Product lifecycles vary throughout your customer base. Some customers perceive that a product is in an introductory phase while others feel it's mature and worth a premium. Therefore, you should price for different customer groups at specific points in time.\n  5.  **Review your models:** Typically, companies model price against product complexity and a range of features. But features change, some products don't achieve their expected sales volumes, and external influences can give products a limited shelf life. Establish a governance process to regularly review your models against the products you \u2013 and your competition \u2013 offer and make changes to ensure prices are always competitive.\n  6.  **Customize your data and variables:** Many companies rely solely on the most convenient datasets when conducting pricing analysis. But for effective pricing analytics, you need the best available data. Make sure you have a strategy for tailoring your pricing evaluation process to harness the most appropriate datasets and variables.\n  7.  **Build for reusability:** Because pricing is not a one-off task, you should build your methods and models for reuse. Machine learning frameworks can automatically refresh model development and pricing recommendations to maximize reusability.\n  8.  **Don't forget psychology:** Beyond the analytics of determining a price, understanding the psychology of pricing and the customer is key. For instance, continuous exposure to higher prices can reduce customer sensitivity to the price of a product.\n\nAcross all these areas, it's important to consider the input of team members\nwith relevant industry expertise and experience. If their intuition tells them\na price is too high or low, they should explore this sentiment and use it to\ncontinuously improve the models and pricing recommendations.\n\n## Augmenting intelligence in optimized pricing and analytics\n\nPricing decisions could be made entirely by algorithms or entirely by people.\nBut the optimal pricing decisions lie between these two extremes \u2013 where\npricing analytics plays a crucial role.\n\nFor example, when a salesperson decides to deviate from a recommended price to\nclose a deal, they call upon all the customer insights available. When\ncontract prices are set, they're based on expected long-term revenue and\nrelated insights. When commodity product prices are determined, they're\ndecided based on margin, profit, and turnover expectations. All these\ndecisions are not merely human decisions, but decisions that analytics can and\nshould augment.\n\nFinding the optimal price is not just a mathematics problem, it's a decision-\nmaking problem. And it's a decision that is sometimes bound in politics,\nemotions, and economics. Therefore, human intelligence combined with purpose-\nbuilt analytics often leads to the best outcomes across the board.\n\nWith an effective pricing analytics strategy, the optimum price for every\nproduct and every customer can be identified. This means \u2013 even during periods\nof disruption and uncertainty \u2013 that confidence in pricing decisions can\nprotect profits. It's the best of both worlds: human _and_ data-driven\ninsights.\n\n## Visit our data and analytics solutions page\n\nLearn more\n\n  * Share\n  *   *   *   * \n\n###### Point of view\n\nThe relentless pursuit of a world that works better for people\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Locations\n  * Our purpose\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Genpact.
