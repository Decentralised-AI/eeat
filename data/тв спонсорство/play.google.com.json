Two Google products that are incompatible? Ridiculous. If you are\non the phone and decide to switch to video call (through Meet) once you switch\nthe audio won't go on speakerphone so you can barely hear the other person.\nYou have to hang up and call on meet or, like I do, use a different video\ncalling platform. No fix for this for YEARS. Edit to reply to Google's\ncomment: I've done it all. Doesn't help.\n\n1 person found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nHi again, Alex.

I could be in the middle of sending a\nvideo and the screen goes black. I just got a brand new phone and all the apps\nare up to date. Not sure what the problem is, as well for freezing. Mid video\ncalls and it freezes and sounds choppy, doesn't matter if I'm connected to\nWiFi or not. FYI the troubleshooting recommended nor the help center, help fix\nthe problem.\n\n873 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nHi again.

Main thing I like\nabout it is it doesn't drain your battery as much as other options.\nUnfortunately audio tends to cut out, I would rather have a delay and clearly\nunderstand what the person is saying than having it cut out and not\nunderstanding anything at all. Of course this also has to do with\nWiFi/Cellular but I feel like its something that could be optimized for people\non the go.\n\n595 people found this review helpful\n\nDid you find this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSee all reviews\n\n## What's new\n\n\u2022Make group video calls with up to 32 people  \n\u2022Share and join group calls with a link  \n\u2022Take photos of your video calls  \n\u2022Try doodles, masks and fun effects with Family mode (Sign-in required with a\nGoogle account)\n\n _flag_ Flag as inappropriate\n\n## App support\n\n _expand_more_\n\n _email_\n\nSupport email\n\napps-help@google.com\n\n _place_\n\nAddress\n\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043\n\n _shield_\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n## More by Google LLC\n\n _arrow_forward_\n\nYouTube TV: Live TV & more\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.0 _star_\n\nYouTube Kids\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.3 _star_\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.3 _star_\n\nGoogle Home\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.2 _star_\n\nGoogle Wallet\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.4 _star_\n\nGoogle Chat\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.4 _star_\n\n##  Similar apps\n\n _arrow_forward_\n\nGoogle Chrome: Fast & Secure\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.1 _star_\n\nZoom - One Platform to Connect\n\nzoom.us\n\n4.1 _star_\n\nSkype\n\nSkype\n\n4.1 _star_\n\nMessenger\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n\n4.1 _star_\n\nChrome Beta\n\nGoogle LLC\n\n4.4 _star_\n\nMicrosoft OneDrive\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\n4.6 _star_\n\n _flag_ Flag as inappropriate\n\nGoogle Play\n\nPlay Pass\n\nPlay Points\n\nGift cards\n\nRedeem\n\nRefund policy\n\nKids & family\n\nParent Guide\n\nFamily sharing\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy\n\nAbout Google Play\n\nDevelopers\n\nGoogle Store\n\nUnited States (English (United States))\n\n",
