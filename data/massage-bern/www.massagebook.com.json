That\u2019s particularly true\nnow after a period of inflation as you find yourself paying more for life\u2019s\nbasic necessities. Think about it through the lens of inflation. If your\nprices don\u2019t increase, you\u2019re essentially discounting your services by the\nrate of inflation (about 7-8% in the past year).\n\nThe trick to setting and changing your prices is charging enough to make a\nfair profit but not so much that you scare away existing and potential\nclients. In the following sections, we\u2019ll provide some insight and some ideas\non how to raise your prices as a massage therapist without losing clients as\nyou do so.\n\n## **Understand Your Local Massage Market**\n\nThe first step in raising your rates is understanding the market for massage\nand bodywork services in your area. Research the prices of other massage\ntherapists and see where you fit in. Are you charging less than the average\nwhile offering an equivalent experience? If so, then you definitely have room\nto raise your rates.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider which massage or bodywork modalities you\noffer. For example, are you a specialist with extensive experience in\nmyofascial release techniques or prenatal massage? If so, you should be able\nto charge more for your specialized services. Plus, if you\u2019re trained in\nmedical massages, you may be able to accept insurance for your massage\nbilling. That way, even if you raise prices, your clients won\u2019t need to bear\nall the burden themselves.\n\n## **Communicate With Your Clients**\n\nWhen it comes to adjusting prices for your massage services, early, strong,\nand consistent communication is absolutely vital. Be straightforward with your\nclients, keep them informed well in advance that you\u2019ll be raising your rates,\nand provide clear reasons for why this is necessary.\n\nWhether it is due to an increase in expenses, such as rent or supplies, or\nbecause you have invested in additional training or certifications to serve\nthem better, it is important that you be transparent.\n\nBut we must also not forget the true value that we bring to the lives of our\nclients. The benefits of massage therapy go far beyond simple relaxation and\npain relief. Regular massage can improve overall health, reduce stress and\nanxiety, and even improve sleep quality. So as you consider raising our rates,\nit\u2019s also important to remind your clients of the impact that your services\nhave on their well-being.\n\nTo bring this discussion around the delicate task of adjusting your prices,\nI\u2019d like to stress once more the importance of clear, honest, and frequent\ncommunication. No one likes unwelcome surprises, so your job is to do\neverything possible to get the message out well in advance. 60 to 90 days\nadvance notice with regular reminders as the countdown to new prices\nprogresses is a good rule of thumb to follow.\n\n## **Offer Package Deals**\n\nAnother way to raise your rates without losing clients is by offering package\ndeals. For example, you could increase your prices for one-time services but\ndiscount the sale of multi-session packages or memberships to levels where the\nprice increase is less.\n\nThe beauty of this is that you\u2019ll likely end up with more regular clients who\ncome more frequently, resulting in more income than you may have received with\njust the sale of one-time services.\n\nTo soften the bite, you can also add a little \u201csurprise and delight\u201d\nconsisting of an add-on service such as aromatherapy. Giving just a wee bit\nmore than your clients expect is a surefire way to put a smile on their faces\nand get them back for more.\n\n* * *\n\nRaising your massage rates doesn\u2019t have to mean losing business. By\nunderstanding the market, communicating regularly with your clients, and\noffering package deals and incentives, you can increase your income without\nsacrificing the quality of your services.\n\nTo see what kind of an impact raising your prices could have on your monthly\nand annual income, you can use our handy massage income calculator to zone in\non some numbers that make sense.
