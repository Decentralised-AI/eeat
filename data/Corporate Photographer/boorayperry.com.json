I work for a very prestigious commercial real estate firm, so it was\nvital to get prestine & professional shots done. All of the pictures came out\ngreat and my agents loved them. It was a pleasure working with Booray as he\nwas very responsive, easy to communicate with on what we wanted and had a\nquick turnaround with the shots. Would definitely recommend Booray and we for\nsure will be using him again! :)\n\nMarcus and Millchap\n\nWorking with Booray for a headshot was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had\nwith a photographer. In my role as a coordinator at my company, one of my main\nresponsibilities is to arrange headshots for my colleagues in the area. The\nturnaround time was quick, he was timely and diligent in his responses, and\njust overall a delight to work with!\n\nWhen tasked with obtaining a headshot for a colleague, our company had\nspecific guidelines that needed to be adhered to. Booray successfully met all\nthe prescribed criteria, delivering an astounding headshot. The entire process\nwas conducted in a professional manner, flawlessly executed from start to\nfinish. If you find yourself in need of a corporate headshot, I wholeheartedly\nrecommend reaching out to Booray for your photography needs without\nhesitation!\n\nIris TeleHealth\n\nBooray has been a great photography partner for our small business! He\u2019s taken\nheadshots for several of our Tampa-based associates and nailed the look to\nmatch the rest of our company photos. He was super responsive, quick to\nprovide the edited images, and made the whole experience smooth + easy. Not\nonly were the headshots great quality, but they were reasonably priced as\nwell. Highly recommend!\n\nFCM\n\nI needed headshots for a new position and because of a prior experience, I\nknew Booray Perry Photography was the perfect solution. Booray was quick to\nrespond, professional and the quality of his work is superb. I highly\nrecommend Booray Perry Photography!\n\nKevin\n\nBooray was immediately likeable and knows his craft\u2026which made my headshot\nsession both fun and fast. I brought an array of outfit options and he quickly\nhelped me land on what would look best \u2013 from the clothes to the jewelry. As\nthe session progressed, he asked for my input: what side did I prefer, did I\nlike a certain pose better than another, how did I feel about the pictures he\nhad just taken. The outcome was amazing and he had the retouched photographs\nto me very quickly. To that point, one facet of the retouch didn\u2019t look\nnatural to me and my family (to be fair, it was so small most likely no one\nelse would have noticed, but it just was hard for me to \u201cunsee\u201d when my\nhusband pointed it out) and I asked him if he could re-do it. I offered to pay\nextra for the extra work, but he didn\u2019t ask for any additional fees, he just\nfixed it within about 30 minutes and it was perfect. I would highly recommend\nBooray for your photography needs.\n\nLaura\n\nFantastic human! Great communication in getting something set up for me in no\ntime. My headshots came out looking great and I received them the same day\nthey were taken. Highly recommend!\n\nZachary\n\n## Contact Us Today!\n\n## How will you stand out from the competition?\n\nYour headshot is your first impression.
