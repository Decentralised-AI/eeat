Lightning fast turnaround\ntime, within 48 hours, gets your images back quickly so that there is no time\nwasted. Also included, in all corporate photography sessions, are full\nresolution digital negatives for publication and reproduction at your own\ndiscretion. All images are provided on a password protected online site that\ncan be accessed by multiple employees or guests for viewing and downloading.\n\nI work with micro-businesses and start ups, all the way up to Fortune 500\ncompanies.\n\nCorporate Photo Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n## commercial photography\n\nCommercial photography can be anything from product photography in studio to\non site capture of your business in the field or in the office. I work with\ncompanies on a variety of projects from updating their websites and\npromotional materials to social media campaigns. I use high end digital SLR\ncameras and professional lighting that can help you have images with impact.\nCombine that with fast turnarounds, affordable pricing and great customer\nservice and your company is sure to shine.\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\n* * *\n\nView fullsize\n\n## professional Headshot photography\n\nMy affordable professional headshot photography packages include full\nresolution digital images and can be scheduled as an on site studio session or\nat location of your choice for a more personal and casual approach. I provide\nboth formal headshots for social media and professional profiles as well as\nprofessional lifestyle portraits.

When your business\ninvests a significant amount in an event, having a quality professional\nphotographer at your call is always a plus to make sure that nothing is missed\nand you have fantastic professional images for promotion. Capturing photos on\nyour camera phone for these events quite often neglects lighting conditions,\nsubject movements during live action moments, and it takes away one of your\nemployees from enjoying the moment.
