For\nyour average professional, the most popular place for corporate headshots is\non their LinkedIn profile.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re a CEO or company executive, you\u2019ll likely also use these\nheadshots on a wide range of materials.\n\nThese business headshots focus on showcasing the subject\u2019s professionalism,\nfriendliness, and competence. A great headshot is the perfect first step for\nbuilding an awesome personal brand that helps you get hired faster, improves\nyour sales numbers, or attracts investors to your company.\n\n## **Are Corporate Headshots Important?**\n\nHave you ever met someone that you _instantly_ either **liked** , or\n**disliked**?\n\nPerhaps you knew why you felt that way about them, or perhaps you didn\u2019t, but\nmost people are prone to generating \u201cfirst impressions\u201d of other people in\njust 1/8th of a single second. These first impressions can have dramatic\nimpact on who they hire, buy from, and otherwise listen to.\n\nThese days, most first impressions start **online**.\n\nHiring managers use LinkedIn to screen applicants. Potential clients use\ncompany website to research vendors. Investors use the company About Us page\nto learn about company executives.  \n\nA great corporate headshot is critical for making a good first impression with\nthese people \u2013 and so can have a major impact on your career or company.  \n\n## **What Do I Wear for Corporate Headshots?**\n\nIt depends on your personality, industry and where the photos will be placed!\n\nFor more conservative industries like law and finance, we recommend the\nstandard suit-and-tie, or female equivalent.\n\nOtherwise, the best rule-of-thumb is to take a look around LinkedIn to see how\npeers and senior executives in your industry are dressed. Make sure to pay\ncloser attention to people who are successful vs whomever is in your immediate\nnetwork.\n\nRemember, dress for the job you **want** , not the job you **have**.  If\nyou\u2019re still not sure, then ask us! We\u2019re always happy to provide guidance.\n\n\n\n## **How Do I Pose for Corporate Headshots?**\n\nNo need to go crazy on your poses for business headshots. In our sessions, we\ntend to focus on minimalist poses. We\u2019ve seen other photographers force\nclients into some truly bizarre poses. But, we avoid this practice like the\nplague.\n\nWe are, after all, showcasing  **your**  professionalism \u2014 not **  our\n**photography.\n\nAt the beginning of your session, you should warm up with simple and\nstraightforward poses. Simply stand there and smile.\n\nLater, we will work toward some arms-crossed headshots and perhaps a couple\ncandids.\n\n## **What Backdrops are Best for Corporate Headshots?**\n\nFor more conservative industries like law and finance, we recommend neutral\nbackdrops based in white, gray or black. With those colors, we can get some\nreally crisp shots that convey reliability and consistency. Visit our\n**headshot backgrounds** page to see previews of all studio background\noptions.\n\nIf you work in creative industries, non-profits, or tech, and you\u2019d like your\nphotos to have a bit more \u201cpop,\u201d feel free to pick a colored studio backdrop\nor try an outdoor/in-office session. These photos often have a bit more\npersonality.\n\nIf you\u2019re a senior executive, entrepreneur or thought-leader, you should\nprobably have several photos of yourself that you can use across platforms.\nIdeally, you would have a couple outdoor photos to supplement your studio\nheadshots.\n\nIf you have the same exact headshot on LinkedIn, the company website, and\npress releases, it can look a bit amateurish.\n\nHeadShots Inc Offers 11 Studio Backdrop Options\n\n## **How Should I Prepare for Corporate Headshots?**\n\nThere are three keys to preparing for your headshot ahead of time.\n\n**First** , if possible, try to get some sleep, exercise, and sunshine in the\nweeks before your session. Our editing team airbrushes your selected photos\nbefore delivering them to you, but your preparation will help ensure that the\nphotos look as natural as possible.\n\n**Second** , make sure to briefly wear your desired clothing a couple days\nbefore your session. You want to make _sure_ that your outfits still fits\nproperly and doesn\u2019t need dry cleaning.\n\n**Third** , take a look at some prior photos of yourself and see if there are\nany that you particularly like. When you arrive at the studio, show those\nphotos to your photographer, and that will help us find an angle that you find\nflattering.\n\n\n\n## What If I\u2019m Not Photogenic or Hate Getting My Photo Taken?\n\nWe\u2019ve got you covered! Most portrait photographers are unfortunately guilty of\ncreating a cringe-y environment for their clients. They force you into awkward\nposes and don\u2019t truly understand what clients are looking for from their\nsession. Either that, or they rush you through the session.\n\nAt HeadShots Inc, we strive to create a fun & stress-free environment for\n**every** client. At our studio, we play upbeat music and constantly get\nfeedback from the client so that we can work towards an amazing headshot that\nyou\u2019ll be proud to show online.\n\n\n\n## **How Much Do Corporate Headshots Cost?**\n\nCorporate headshots can cost anywhere between $89 and $1500 depending on\ngeography, package, and provider.\n\nWhen considering pricing, remember to look at a) licensing (who owns the\nphotos) and b) retouching fees.\n\nIn terms of licensing, photographers typically only give you ownership for\nphotos that you buy from them. This fee is separate from your \u201csession fee,\u201d\nwhich just covers the time spent inside their studio.\n\nIf you want to use your photos on a press release, advertisement, magazine, or\nbook cover, you may have to pay additional licensing fees.\n\nFor retouching, many photographers charge between $50 and $150 per photo.\nCalculate those fees into your total session cost.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a less expensive option, there are also Virtual Headshot\nservices that start at $49/photo.\n\n## **Looking For Corporate Headshot Pricing?**\n\nFind the perfect headshot package for your goals and budget below.\n\n### Individual Sessions\n\nHeadshot sessions for individuals and small groups of up to four people.
