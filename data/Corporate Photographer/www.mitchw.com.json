My goal is to provide\nyou with some useful information about my corporate and editorial photography\nwork. If you're searching for an Albany NY photographer or need an upstate NY\nphotographer you've come to the right place. I specialize in many different\ntypes of work as an Albany New York professional photographer working upstate.\nOne area of specialty is in corporate photography, creating images for\nbusinesses and institutions for a variety of needs ranging from internal\ncommunications to external advertising. Starting my career as a full time\nstaff news photojournalist means that I take on a lot of editorial photography\nassignments for newspapers and magazines, including trade magazines. Educated\nas a photojournalist, I also perform a lot of documentary photography, also\nknown as photojournalism, documenting events that unfold which are largely out\nof my control. A sub specialty which has evolved through my career is\nproducing business head shots or executive portraits which are always required\nas part of my work as an annual report photographer. And a final subset of my\nwork includes what is referred to as convention or conference photography\nwhere I document conventions, business meetings, presentations and similar\nevents where the business staff of a corporation gathers together.\n\nI cover a wide range of territory and will travel nationwide for any\nassignments you may require. My work in the past has taken me as a\nphotographer throughout the Northeast in the United States including Albany,\nthe Hudson River Valley, Cooperstown, New York, Lake Placid, Syracuse,\nBinghamton, Rochester and Buffalo. Nationally I have worked as a commercial\nphotographer in Harrisburg, Raleigh, Atlanta, Dallas, Albuquerque, Santa Fe,\nNew Orleans as well as many other locations throughout the country.\n\n## Albany NY Photographer\n\nAs a professional photographer in Albany, NY I perform corporate, editorial,\nlocation, business event and other photography in Cooperstown, Saratoga\nSprings, Lake Placid, and Binghamton. Working on many different types of\nassignments for many different clients means that I perform photography\nranging from documentary to medical to environmental portraiture to executive\nportraiture and even advertising photography. My decades of experience as an\nAlbany professional photographer give me the skills to handle a wide variety\nof assignments whether you need executive portraiture, event photography, or\nannual report photography. I have the skills and experience needed to handle\nthese sorts of assignments for you. From my home base as an Albany NY\nphotographer, I can easily handle assignments throughout the state. My regular\nterritory begins in the area colloquially referred to as upstate New York,\nwhich roughly is defined as the area in the Hudson River Valley above New York\nCity where I often work for editorial and corporate clients who need an\nupstate New York photographer. With state government in my back yard, a wide\nvariety of clients contact me when they are looking for an Albany or Saratoga\nSprings photographer. Since I'm so centrally located, it's easy for me to\ntravel if you need a Cooperstown photographer or a photographer in the Lake\nGeorge area. Of course, I'm available for travel anywhere and have completed\nassignments for a variety of clients all over the state and the country.\n\n## Albany NY Conference Convention and Meeting Photographer\n\nOften I will be commissioned to produce what is referred to as conference\nphotography. As an Albany photographer I am well placed in the state to attend\nmany different types of functions where you might require convention\nphotography or what is also referred to as corporate event photography. These\ntypes of events are where a business or institution gathers large numbers of\npeople together and may require executive portraiture, event coverage, awards\nphotography, or other types of photography that a large and complex business\nevent may require. I have performed this type of meeting photography in\nSyracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Albany, the Hudson Valley, Upstate as well as\nnationally in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas and Raleigh.\n\n### Corporate Photographer Albany NY\n\nAs an Albany NY corporate and commercial photographer many of my assignments\ncenter around working as an annual report photographer and as a business\nphotographer. This type of work means that I work for high tech companies as\nwell as familiar traditional businesses doing business photography for their\ninternal and external communications needs as well as media distribution\nphotographs. Often I work as an industrial photographer or a construction\nphotographer as well. Sometimes this type of work is referred to as corporate\nphotography and as a New York corporate photographer I have covered\nassignments for very large and very small businesses.\n\n### Editorial Photographer Albany NY\n\nAs an editorial photographer in Albany I have covered a wide range of\npublication photography assignments. This work can also be referred to as what\na photojournalist in Albany does. I have completed assignments for trade\nmagazine use as well as for newspapers and other publications. This type of\nphotography requires me to work as more of a documentary photographer where I\nam observing an event unfolding and responding to what I see in front of me.\nHowever, this sort of skill can be combined with my work as a commercial\nphotographer in Albany, allowing me to produce very high quality images that\nlook spontaneous for trade magazine,advertising, corporate, and public\nrelations needs.\n\n### Albany NY Headshot and Executive Portrait Photographer\n\nAs an executive portrait and headshot photographer I have taken photographs of\nbusiness people and executives all over the state. Often referred to as a\nbusiness headshot photographer or corporate headshot photographer in New York\nthis specialty refers to creating a formal business portrait of a person. I\nalso do a lot of environmental portraiture which means taking a photograph of\na person in there familiar or customary surroundings. This is different from a\ncorporate headshot photographer in New York where a single background is often\nset up and large numbers of employees head shots are then taken.\n\nI work often in many different cities throughout the state as a New York\nphotographer including Cooperstown, Saratoga Springs, Schenectady, The Hudson\nValley, Binghamton, Lake Placid, Syracuse, Rochester, Ithaca, Lake George as\nwell as from my home base as an Albany photographer.

Consulting over decades with design firms, art\ndirectors advertising agencies, publications and communications departments\nhas given me the insight into the types of images that companies need and\nwant. I photograph manufacturing, industrial operations, business operations,\neducation topics, healthcare, agriculture and farming in Albany, Saratoga\nSprings, Troy, Hudson Valley, Upstate, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Glens Falls,\nLake Placid, Utica, Syracuse, Cooperstown, Binghamton, Rochester and Buffalo.\nOf course, I also travel nationwide, bringing my brand of corporate and\nbusiness photography anywhere you may need.\n\nAs an award winning photojournalist and news photographer for 2 decades, I\nbring realism into my work, and bringing it to your company in New York, the\nHudson valley and Upstate is my goal. This doesn't mean that I lurk in the\nshadows, hoping the perfect image will happen in front of me. My wide\nexperience has created a repository of experiences and ideas that I can apply\nto your setting, creating the dynamic business photos you need. Additionally,\nmy extensive experience means I can work quickly so that a large entourage\nisn't required on the shoot day. And the disruption to your work day or\noperations is minimized.\n\nVisual communication is the strongest way to reach your potential customers\nand clients, the best way to connect with your employees and staff. You need\nreal photos of your actual staff and operations. Stock photography doesn't\ncommunicate who you are as a company or institutions. Instead, it repels the\nviewer who doesn't get a feel for who you really are. Dynamic, real images of\nyour actual employees, facilities and operations will connect with your\ncustomers as well as your staff, strengthening your message, putting the face\non who you are and what you do.\n\n## Albany NY Business Photographer\n\nWith my home base as a Capital district photographer in Albany NY, I have a\ngeographical advantage allowing me to easily travel to and access other cities\nin New York state very easily.
