So I figured I would\ndedicate a few blogs to breaking down exactly what certain photographers do.\nToday we are going to look at the life of a Dallas corporate photographer, and\nsee what all they are up to day in and day out.\n\nSo what does a corporate photographer in Dallas do? Well, the short answer is\nthat they are specialized in shooting for businesses. Whereas other\nphotographic specialties may be focused on helping to market a product or\nservice, corporate photography usually carries more of an emphasis on the\npeople and places behind these products and services.\n\nContact Jason Today\n\nThough the needs can be fairly broad, I\u2019ve found that most corporate\nphotography needs are focused in three areas:\n\n **Headshots \u2013**\n\nMost of the corporate work that I do ends up on the web. Whether it\u2019s for a\ncompany website, intranet or social media presence, the vast majority of\ncontent that I create is destined for online. Headshots are no exception.\n\nDallas headshot photography is one of the most popular services offered by a\ncorporate photographer, and is arguably the most important.\n\nAfter all, it puts a face to a name when you are looking at people you want to\ndo business for. I\u2019ve had clients tell me about their clients selecting them\nafter looking at their headshot and comparing it to others, so there is a lot\nof power in letting people see your face.\n\n**Portraits \u2013**\n\nFor corporate, I generally keep the portrait category a bit loose. There are\ngenerally two flavors of photography that fall into this area: posed and\ncandid. Some clients want a shot of their CEO, team or combination in a posed\nmanner, either in the office or at a location that speaks to what they do or\nthe area where they are doing business.\n\nOr, they want images that show members of the team collaborating or\ninteracting with customers. This helps to show how a company approaches its\nwork, and what the office dynamics are both amongst its own people and in the\ninteractions with clients. There are a lot of companies that like to get a\ncombination of these flavors so that they can mix it up across the different\npages of their website.\n\n**Interiors \u2013**\n\nThis is the final area that most Dallas corporate photographers handle for\nclients. By documenting their office environment, it can be very helpful for a\ncompany to illustrate what kind of experience their clients will have when\nworking for them. It can go a long way in showing that they are professional,\ntop notch, a place that is calm and relaxing, or whatever specific feeling the\ncompany is trying to evoke. For instance, if you were going to a medical\nfacility, you want to see a place that looks clean, contemporary, but also\nwarm and inviting. A corporate photographer would be the one to show your\nfacility in the best light possible. It is even a differentiating factor if\nyou have a space that has been recently remodeled, very unique, or contain\ncertain modern amenities. Your competition may not be as up to date with their\nofferings, and it can really set you apart.\n\nSo as you can see, a Dallas corporate photographer is focused on helping show\nthe people and places that provide great services and experiences. People like\nto be familiar with the people they are going to do business with, and they\nlike to see the environment they will be working in as well. A Dallas\ncorporate photographer is the one who can bring both of these aspects to\nlight.\n\nJason Kindig\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## What\u2019s the difference between a portrait and a headshot?\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## Why Your Family Photographer Isn't A Commercial Photographer\n\n* * *\n\n#### **PORTFOLIOS** ******COMMISSIONS** ******CLIENTS** ******REVIEWS**\n\n#### CONTACT **** | OVERVIEW | ABOUT | BLOG\n\n\u00a92023 Jason Kindig Photography, LLC.\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n",
