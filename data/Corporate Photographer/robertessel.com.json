Follow on Instagram\n\n2023 Robert Essel Photography / All Rights Reserved\n\nInstagram\n\nPage load link\n\nAs one of the leading\n\n# NYC Corporate and Medical Photographer\n\nRobert Essel works in Manhattan photographing for leading hospitals and\ncorporations.  \n  \n\n## Corporate Portrait Photographers\n\n| Robert Essel is a professional corporate photographer who specializes in\nphotographing executive portraits, professional headshots, corporate meetings,\ngroup shots at any business location. Robert photographs for editorial,\nadvertising and business clients for various Fortune 500 corporations. His\nphotos have appeared in various business publications, brochures, annual\nreports, websites and advertising campaigns. His imagery is a blend of\ncarefully crafted photo lighting techniques supported by latest up to date\ncutting edge photographic equipment. He understands his subjects sometimes\nhave a limited amount time in a photography session but works under tight\ndeadlines to deliver quality finished digital images.  \n  \n\n## 3: NYC Portrait Photographers\n\n| Robert is a portrait photographer located in New York City. He has been a\nresident of The Big Apple for about 30 plus years and loves photographing the\npeople and multiracial community. One block away from his location is Central\nPark, his backyard. The park has a lot of great photo locations like\nStrawberry Fields, Bethesda Fountain, Sheep Meadow, Bow Bridge, The Lake, The\nBoathouse, etc. These iconic photographic locations make great backgrounds for\nenvironmental portraits, business portraits, personal portraits, group\nportraits and family portraits. The special iconic locations here in NY add\nanother dimension of realism and value to the photos.  \n  \n\nHealthcare Photographer | Robert has documented in many medical institutions.\nHis camera lens has recorded many doctors, nurses, patients, researchers,\ntechnicians and support staff in a variety of hospitals, clinics, operating\nrooms and labs. Robert has donated his time to local and overseas charitable\nhospital programs in his recent travels to Africa. Mission in Tanzania is a\nprogram associated with Weill Cornell in which Robert gave of his time to\nhelping the people of that African nation.. Capturing unique imagery has\nalways been the number one goal to pleasing clients. He is great collaborator\nand enjoys the team spirit of listening and helping people solve creative\nphotographic problems and to turn them into creative solutions.  \n  \n\n## People Photographer NYC\n\n| Successful corporate portrait photography sometimes requires pre-planning in\norder to get great digital image captures. How a business professional dresses\nis very important for a portrait sitting. Business attire that is tailored\nsays a lot about the person. The color of a guy\u2019s tie or the color of a\nwoman\u2019s dress, say something from a psychological point of view. By wearing\nred you are implying that you mean business. Blue conveys trust, stability and\nconfidence. Green is about practicality, reliability and implies being down to\nEarth. Business headshot photography is valuable asset for any professional to\nbe noticed and respected.  \n  \n\n6: Corporate People Photographer | When doing a photo shoot for clients they\nask what should I wear for my professional portrait session. I recommend\ncomfortable fitting clothes that are solid in color, pastel and or simple in\ndesign. The idea is to dress for success but not have the fashion of your\nclothes overpower your face. As one of the NYC corporate portrait\nphotographers here in New York business people time is valuable, so being\nefficient in the preparation is a must.. Corporate people photographers need\nto help business professionals and entrepreneurs elevate their stature\npictorially through the universal language of photography. The photo assistant\nis always on hand to help style an executive portrait, apply makeup when\nneeded and keep a watchful eye on any hair that may become out of place. Our\ngoal is to promote a supportive environment so subjects feel relaxed and they\nknow they are well looked after.  \n  \n\n## New York Executive Portrait Headshot Photographers\n\n| As a corporate people photographer, business clients often ask how many\nphotos do you take during a corporate photography session. There is no limit\non how many photos will be taken for photo shoot for corporate headshots, just\nthe amount of images that are required. Some people warm to the camera quickly\nand other business professionals need more time to relax and so we are happy\naccommodate them during their corporate portraits. As a NYC corporate portrait\nphotographer we love helping people achieve their greatness by empowering them\nin conversation and capturing great images. As a professional photographer we\nhave photographed business professionals in the photographic studio. We also\nset up lighting and sometimes backgrounds on location in businessman\u2019s office,\nconference room or just utilizing the office environment. Our forte is\nphotographing execs on location for industry, in boardrooms and other places\nof business. The staff bring in our own camera gear when taking photos and on\noccasion we will shoot with available light, depending on the lighting\nconditions at a location and or if there is a time limit to complete the\nphotography.  \n  \n\n## Corporate Industrial Photographer NYC\n\n| As an industrial photographer we have traveled internationally for a diverse\nlist of blue chip corporations. Photographing industrial sites are like the\nbright lights of self-contained little cities with an endless array of pipes,\nwires and metal structures. The key in my opinion to capturing dynamic images\nin this industrial manufacturing environment is to focus on the simplicity of\ndesign and shapes. Industry that focuses on assembly line production,\ncarefully crafted products or are service based companies each require their\nown special creative solutions from a visual standpoint. The use of\nphotographic lighting can help further enhance and define industry elements\nand help strengthen the photographic message.  \n  \n\nRobert Essel serves New Jersey, Manhattan, New York City, Newark.  \n  \n\n19|168|bjd  \n  \n---  \n  \nGo to Top\n\n",
