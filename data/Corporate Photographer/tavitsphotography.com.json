Since that time, I have sought out like\nminded individuals that never settle for less and strive to become better in\ntheir craft. Headshots, corporate events, and parties would be my primary\nphotography specialties\u2019. Besides taking pictures, I enjoy hiking, going to\ncomedy shows, attending music festivals, and being with my wife, daughter and\n2 dogs. I\u2019m still searching for the perfect cup of coffee which corresponds\nwith my passion to travel.\n\nGwendolynPhotographer\n\nIt was dusk on the edge of the Grand Canyon\u2019s north rim. Summer of 2000. I\u2019d\njust earned my bachelor\u2019s in photography from ASU. Sitting on the rock ledge,\nan event producer friend turned to me and asked \u201cGwendolyn, would you shoot a\nsales meeting next month in Boca Raton?\u201d That\u2019s how it all began for me. Fast\nforward 22 years, and I\u2019m still hooked on creating compelling imagery for\ncorporate clients.

The photos he showed us, we so full\nof life, color and beauty and that was exactly what we wanted for our day. We\nhad booked him right away knowing he would be the perfect person, I\u2019d prefer\nto call him an artist, to help capture our wedding day! We took him to our\nvenue and we could see his excitement and the wheels spinning in his head for\nfun and unique photo ideas that are definitely outside the cookie cutter\nwedding box which in the end, had no idea he would actually bring those ideas\nto life. He is professional, patient, creative, encouraging and very\ncomfortable to work with. If something didn\u2019t work, he would make a change and\npoof\u2026magic!!

I could not have imagined how PERFECT our\nwedding album is\u2026every picture was more beautiful than the next that they\nhonestly bring tears to my eyes, seriously. When you think of capturing your\nwedding day, knowing you won\u2019t see every moment happening, it was so great to\nsee that Tavit took the time to photograph every single guest and all the\ndetails that you tend to forget because as the couple you are wrapped up in\nthe day. I could not be more thankful for him.\n\nRyan Schmidt - Event Photography\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 2 years ago\n\nTavit took photos at my bridal shower and I loved everyone of them!
