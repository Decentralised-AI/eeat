If\npeople don\u2019t see you, they won\u2019t know you and all of that hard work goes down\nthe drain. Corporate photography helps you establish a visual brand and pulls\nback the curtain to showcase your people and your process.\n\nThrough a diverse library of images, you can place your brand in front of the\nright audience and create buzz about your products and services. While it may\nseem easy to cut corners and try DIY iPhone photography, hiring a professional\nphotographer provides countless benefits.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll discuss the definition of corporate photography, cover\nthe different types and elaborate on why it\u2019s so important to invest in a\nprofessional.\n\n## Defining Corporate Photography\n\nCorporate photography is the practice of capturing authentic images for a\nbusiness that will be used to promote the organization and market its products\nand/or services. In doing so, the image library helps create an organizational\nbrand and image for the company.\n\nA professional corporate photographer specializes in shooting for businesses\nwith an emphasis on the people and places that drive the company\u2019s products,\nservices and brand. Businesses of all sizes and industries can benefit from\nthe skills and experience of a trained corporate photographer.\n\n## Types of Corporate Photography\n\nTo compile enough marketing assets to fuel an ad campaign across all mediums,\nyou need a variety of different shots and image styles. From your company\nwebsite to printed brochures, a diverse library ensures that your brand image\nis cohesive and consistent.\n\nCorporate photography is an umbrella term for several different types of\nphotography within a business setting. In the sections below, I\u2019ll explain the\ndifferent types of corporate photography.\n\n### Portraits and Headshots\n\nPortraits and headshots are one of the most, if not the most common types of\ncorporate photography. Professional headshots help put a face to a name and\ngive your staff a sense of reliability.\n\nThe quality of your professional portraits can make a difference and lead\nclients to select your business over the competition.\n\n### Office Environment Photos\n\nOffice environment photos encapsulate the energy and values of your\norganization, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the real people who drive\nthe business. These images can be helpful in attracting customers _and_\npotential employees.\n\nA group of employees smiling as they collaborate on a project tells customers\nthat they\u2019re supporting a company that keeps its employees happy. It also\nconvinces quality talent to apply and become a part of your thriving\norganization.\n\nAlong with candid shots, office environment photos highlight the workplace of\nyour day-to-day operations. Proper lighting and framing emphasize the specific\nvibe and aesthetic of your brand. A tech startup with a sleek, modern design\nshows a company at the forefront of innovation.\n\n### Corporate Event Photos\n\nAlong with shots of the office environment, corporate event photos capture the\ncompany and your people in action. Whether it\u2019s volunteering at a charity or\nspeaking at an industry conference, event photography doubles down on your\nbrand image.\n\nCorporate event photos allow you to visualize your mission, values, culture\nand authority within your industry. A form of commercial lifestyle\nphotography, event photos draw your target audience of customers and\nprospective staff to your organization.\n\n### Product and Advertising Photos\n\nOutside of your people, strategic shots of products and services are another\ntype of corporate photography. Product and advertising photography help create\nmarketing campaigns and enhance your online listings.\n\nUsing appropriate lighting, location, framing and positioning, a professional\nphotographer crafts an aesthetic that draws the appropriate target market to\nyour products and services. In doing so, they keep images on-brand so your\nonline profile is cohesive across all platforms.\n\n## Why Is Corporate Photography Important?\n\nSo, now you understand the different types of photography that go into a\ncorporate session. But why is it important for your company to have a diverse\nlibrary of images? At the top of the list, corporate photography is extremely\nimportant \u2013 if not essential \u2013 to spread your brand image and advertise your\norganization.\n\nOne corporate session can supply your business with enough photos to cover a\nvariety of marketing and promotional materials, including:\n\n  * Company website \n  * Digital and print ads \n  * Online marketing \n  * Social media \n  * Annual reports\n  * Recruitment materials \n  * Product listings\n\nA professional corporate photographer helps to display your company in a way\nthat makes it easy for people to recognize and remember your brand and\nproducts. Authentic images can also speak about your staff and company\nculture, as well as showcase the quality of your products and services.\n\n## Hiring a Professional Corporate Photographer\n\nThe benefits are clear, but why should you spend your hard-earned profits on a\nphotographer? Can\u2019t you just grab your assistant and have them use a few\niPhone photography tricks to get some pictures? _No._ Just because you have a\nprofessional camera doesn\u2019t mean you have the skills to capture images that\nhighlight and enhance your company\u2019s brand and values.\n\nA professional corporate photographer is more than just a person with a nice\ncamera.
