Public adjusters understand the claims process and are\nlicensed by TDI. If you hire a public adjuster, your insurance company may no\nlonger be allowed to talk to you about your claim. See a sample contract\n(PDF).\n\n  2. ## The adjuster\u2019s cost\n\nPublic adjusters charge up to 10% of your final settlement amount. If your\ninsurance company doesn\u2019t increase its offer after you hire the public\nadjuster, you\u2019ll still have to pay the adjuster. And you still have to pay\nyour deductible.\n\n  3. ## Before you sign a contract\n\n    * Call our Help Line at 800-252-3439 to see if a public adjuster is licensed.\n    * Ask the public adjuster how much they charge. You can try to negotiate a lower fee.\n    * Make sure the contract answers these questions: \n      * Will you inspect my damaged property?\n      * Will you talk to my insurance company and ask for a larger amount?\n      * How long will it take you to settle my claim?\n\nIf you change your mind, you have 72 hours after you\u2019ve signed a contract to\ncancel it.\n\nUnder Texas law, public adjusters who work on your claim can\u2019t act as your\ncontractor, and contractors can\u2019t advertise that they\u2019ll handle your insurance\nclaim.\n\n  4. ## Still not happy with your claim?\n\nLearn more about your options if you\u2019re not happy with the outcome of your\nclaim.\n\nIf you\u2019re having issues with your public adjuster, you have the right to sue.\nYou can use these resources to find legal help.\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Working with an insurance adjuster\n  * Steps to getting your home or car insurance claim paid\n  * Will my premium go up if I file a claim?\n\n\n\nQuestions?
