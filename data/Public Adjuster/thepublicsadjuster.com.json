As a policyholder, you have little to lose: We, at The Public\u2019s\nAdjuster will visit your property loss free of charge to help you (the\npolicyholder) determine the severity of damage and whether you should file an\ninsurance claim. Even if you are confident in the dollar value of your\nproperty loss, it is good practice to get a second opinion. Frequently, we\nvisit a home or business and find that your loss estimate is far below what it\nshould be. We are professionals and it\u2019s unlikely we will leave out costs in\nour calculations that you might forget or not know about. Submitting an\naccurate, detailed claim is crucial to getting the right amount of money from\nyour insurance company to cover the full property loss. Remember, even the\nbest homeowners insurance companies will never voluntarily pay more than an\namount claimed. You, as the policyholder need to be conscious you are claiming\nthe correct amount and hiring The Public\u2019s Adjuster will help you ensure that.\n\nView All Our Services __\n\n### Testimonials\n\nTodd at The Public's Adjuster handled our case with care, professionalism and\ntact.
