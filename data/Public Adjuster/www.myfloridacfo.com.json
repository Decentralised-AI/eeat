Public Adjusters\n\n## Public Adjusters\n\n* * *\n\n### Important Things to Remember After a Disaster\n\nIf an adjuster asks you to sign a contract for a fee or a percentage of your\nclaim payment to adjust your claim, you\u2019ve probably been approached by a\npublic adjuster. A public adjuster does not work for nor represents your\ninsurance company. Public adjusters will represent you by adjusting your claim\nand presenting it to your insurance company for a fee.\n\nA public adjuster must be licensed by DFS; ask for their license number, which\nyou may compare to their government-issued photo ID (such as a driver\nlicense).  ****\n\n  * Solicitation by public adjusters is limited to Mon. - Sat., 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n  * For claims caused by a disaster that results in a declaration of a state of emergency by the Governor, the fees public adjusters can charge are limited to 10 percent of the claim payment for one year after the declaration of an emergency, thereafter the fee limit is 20 percent.\n  * Public adjusters cannot charge fees for claim payments paid to you before the date they enter into a contract with you or for services not performed.\n  * An insured or claimant may cancel a contract with a public adjuster within ten (10) business days after it is executed. If the contract was entered into based on an event that is the subject of a declaration of state of emergency by the Governor, then an insured may cancel the contract without any penalty or obligation within 30 days after the date of loss or 10 days after the date on which the contract is executed, whichever is longer.\n\n **Entering into a contract with a public adjuster legally obligates the\ninsurance company to add the public adjuster as an additional payee on the\nclaim check.**\n\nIf you suspect an adjuster is working without a license, or if they urge you\nto overstate an insurance claim, or if you otherwise suspect fraud, call the\nInsurance Fraud Hotline at 1-800-378-0445.\n\nA public adjuster must put fair and honest treatment of the claimant above\ntheir own interests. For more information, read the Public Adjuster Code of\nEthics, Public Adjuster Contract Checklist.  \n\nFor more information download the Disaster Assistance Insurance Helpline\nbrochure.\n\n\n\nGet Insurance Help  \nPurchasing Insurance  \nUnderstanding Insurance  \nMediation/Neutral Evaluation  \nDisaster Preparedness  \nInsurance FAQS\n\nHolocaust Victims Assistance  \nCivil Remedy/Litigation Notices  \nConsumer Protections  \nConsumer Guides  \nFinancial Literacy  \nMedical Providers\n\nCompany Search  \nLicensee Search  \nCareer Opportunities  \nSign up for Consumer Alerts  \nContact Us  \nGet Lean\n\n__\n\nFLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nOur department manages the financial responsibilities for the State of\nFlorida.\n\n__  200 East Gaines Street, Tallahassee, FL 32399\n\nSend Us a Message: ASK FLDFS\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n  * Fraud Free Florida\n  * Prepare Florida\n  * Unclaimed Property\n  * Consumer Helpline\n  * Press Releases\n  * Public Records Request\n\nEMPLOYEE RESOURCES\n\n  * Search Career Opportunities\n  * Employee' Information Center\n  * Florida Deferred Compensation\n  * Employee Emergency Notifications\n\n  * Long-Range Program\n  * Rule Making Regulatory Plans\n  * Legal Notices/Accessibility\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright 2023 Florida Department of Financial Services\n\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  * __\n  * __\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n",
