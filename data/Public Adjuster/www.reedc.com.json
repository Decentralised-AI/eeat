Other responsibilities include appraising\ndamages, preparing an estimate and other claim documentation, and potentially\nre-opening a claim to negotiate for more money if a discrepancy is found after\nthe claim has been settled.\n\nClose\n\n\u00d7\n\n###\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Public Adjusters are different from other insurance professionals and\nalthough they have many of the same requirements, there are some variations.\nTo become a licensed Public Adjuster in New York, you must:**\n\n  * be at least 18 years old\n  * have never committed a felony or possess a criminal history\n  * take and pass the State exam within 2 years of application\n  * submit all required fees and forms as required by the New York State Department of Insurance\n\nDue to the nature of this job, Public Adjusters have some additional\nrequirements imposed upon them that other insurance professionals do not have.\nIn addition, Public Adjusters must also:\n\n  * provide 5 certificates of character for each licensee\n  * provide a $1,000 bond to cover the licensing period\n  * be fingerprinted\n  * have proof of required filing of a partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or trade name\n\nOnce obtained, your license is valid for two years and there is no continuing\neducation requirement. New York is not reciprocal with any other state for\nlicensing adjusters. This means that you may only perform Public Adjuster\nduties in the State of New York with this license. For more information about\nthe application process, see our Insurance Resources page.\n\nClose\n\n\u00d7\n\n###\n\n## Opportunity\n\n**Public Adjusters are trained professionals who are only concerned with their\nclients\u2019 interests. They tend to feel they have a fulfilling job because their\nwork directly helps clients obtain financial support for damages** incurred\nfrom a disaster or unfortunate event, such as fire, vandalism, and weather-\nrelated catastrophes. Public Adjusters in New York charge their clients a\npercentage of the settlement (with the percentage being capped at 12.5% but\nsubject to negotiation)1.\n\nClose\n\n",
