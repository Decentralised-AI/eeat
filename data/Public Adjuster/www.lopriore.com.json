But it is a necessity for a\nhomeowner. The insurance provides the needed financial protection when\nsomething unexpected or catastrophic happens to your home.  \nWhen those unfortunate events happen, for example, water damage from an\noverflowing toilet or storm damage to the roof, you need to call your\ninsurance agent. 6% of homeowners made claims to their insurance company in\n2017 for things like floods, lightning damage, or home fires.\n\nYou have insurance to help cover the damages associated with those home\ndisasters. But how do you, as the property owner, make a claim and come to an\nagreement on the amount you should be paid for the damage?\n\nThis is where claim adjusters come into the picture and help you handle your\nclaim. You know the insurance company has adjusters. Have you heard of a\npublic adjuster that you could hire for a claim to your insurance? What\nreasons would there be to hire a public adjuster?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the public adjuster\u2019s pros and cons. Read on to\nlearn all about making an insurance claim and using a public adjuster vs the\ninsurance adjuster.\n\n## The Claim Process\n\nLet\u2019s use the water damage example to look at the claim\u2019s process. A pipe\nbursts in your bathroom while you\u2019re not home\u2014the bathroom floods with water.\nUnfortunately, the bathroom is on the upper floor of your home.\n\nGravity takes over, and water starts coming through the ceiling to your\nkitchen and landing on your new hardwood flooring. The burst pipe is causing\nsignificant property damage, and you decide to file an insurance claim with\nyour homeowner\u2019s insurance to get repairs taken care of with insurance money.\n\nTo file a claim, you call your insurance company and report the incident. They\nsend out their adjuster to survey the damages and come up with the cost\nestimates.\n\nYou are given money for repairs from the insurance company once the two of you\nagree on the amount proposed by the adjuster.\n\nWhat happens if you cannot come to an agreement on the amount? This is often\nwhen homeowners choose to hire a public adjuster.\n\n## Difference Between a Public Insurance Adjuster and an Insurance Adjuster\n\nSo, what is the difference between an insurance company adjuster and a public\nadjuster?\n\nThe insurance adjuster works for the insurance company. He works on their\nbehalf to get information about claims and come up with the proposed repairs\nand what they would cost for the repairs. The public adjuster would be hired\nand paid by the homeowner.\n\nBoth do the same tasks of evaluating and assessing the damage. Both will write\nup proposals for repairs and their costs. The key difference is who employs\nthem to do that task.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the pros and cons of both kinds of adjusters.\n\n## Insurance Adjuster\n\nThe insurance company employs an adjuster to go to homes and survey damage.\nThey are typically very knowledgeable about the trades of building or\nrepairing a house. Often, they have a contractor\u2019s license or have worked in\nthe field in the past.\n\nThey need to be highly knowledgeable about home construction as they evaluate\ndamages and propose what it will cost to make the necessary repairs.\n\n### Positive of an Insurance Adjuster\n\nThere are a few positives to consider when thinking about using the insurance\ncompany\u2019s adjuster.\n\nThe insurance company can afford to hire adjusters who have a vast range of\nexperience in the field. The adjuster needs to know everything from plumbing,\nheating, cooling, and electrical to finish work like drywall and paint.\n\nThe insurance adjuster\u2019s big bonus is that he or she comes at no additional\ncost to you as the homeowner.\n\nMost people have stayed with the same insurance company for the life of their\nhomeownership. There is no reason to suspect that this adjuster would not want\nto fix the problem and skimp to save the insurance company money.\n\n### Negatives of an Insurance Adjuster\n\nThe truth is, though, they are employed by the insurance company. The work\nthey do is on behalf of the insurance company, not the homeowner.\n\nIf you have had a big loss, like from a fire, the damages will be extensive.\nThere might be some insurance companies who will want to save some money in\nthe payout process. Ultimately, the insurance adjuster answers to the\ninsurance company and needs to satisfy them.\n\nHaving said that, many insurance adjusters have professional reputations.\nTheir goal is not to fix something on the cheap but instead to propose a plan\nthat would get repairs done right.\n\n## Public Insurance Adjusters Work\n\nMany homeowners don\u2019t even know about public insurance adjusters. They assume\nthe work done by the insurance adjuster is done on their behalf.\n\nA public insurance adjuster is employed by the homeowner. The homeowner also\npays them, typically a percentage of the claim amount. A homeowner might\ndecide to hire a public adjuster if they have a potentially large claim and\nare worried about getting everything covered.\n\nIf you hire a public adjuster, the sooner in the claim process, the better. It\nis best if they can take over to speak on your behalf and work with the\ninsurance adjuster right from the onset of the claim.\n\nYou might be wondering how to find a reputable public adjuster. Not all of\nthem have good reputations and can have the reputation of being \u201cambulance\nchasers\u201d looking for a disaster to make some money from.  \nIf you want to hire a public adjuster, start by looking at their credentials.\n\n  * How are they skilled in assessing damages?\n  * What experience do they have in working alongside the insurance company toward a settlement?\n  * How are their communication skills to work with all parties involved to get a settlement?\n\nYou might also look to see if they are members of the National Association of\nPublic Insurance Adjusters. The NAPAI promotes standards for public adjusters.\n\n## Pro of Hiring a Public Adjuster\n\nIf you find yourself in the process of making a claim with your insurance\ncompany, you might find it worthwhile to hire a public adjuster. This might be\nespecially true if you feel like the insurance adjuster does not include all\nthe necessary costs for repairs from your claim.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the positives of hiring a public adjuster.\n\n### Knowledge and Professional Standards\n\nMost states have strict standards for public adjusters. They can\u2019t just decide\nthis is a job; they want to make money. The state requires careful training\nand knowledge to be licensed as a public adjuster. Often public adjusters are\nmembers of their professional organization, which requires certain skill\nstandards.  \nPublic adjusters also must be:\n\n  * Bonded\n  * Fingerprinted\n  * Pass a background check\n\nYou should also expect them to know the ins and out of insurance claims for\nhome and business claims. They should also have some negotiation skills as\nthey will be working closely with the insurance company adjuster to reach a\nmutually agreed-upon settlement.\n\nFacing a catastrophic loss can involve some real stressors. You are faced with\ndamage, loss, and future repairs. There can also be an emotional toll on\nlosing things in your home or business.\n\nFor many, hiring a public adjuster means they have someone to do the thinking\nand negotiating on their behalf. The public adjuster becomes your advocate,\nacting on your behalf.\n\nThis is especially important if you have experienced a huge loss like a home\nfire. It will be hard for you to think about all the things that were once\npart of your home and will need replacing. That becomes the task of the public\nadjuster to guide you through the process.\n\n### Possibility of Missing Part of the Claim\n\nIf you have a big claim, there could be things that need fixing you can\u2019t see\non the surface. Because of their experience and determination to find every\npossible thing, the public adjuster can help to make sure nothing is missed in\nthe claim and claim settlement.\n\nFor example, if you had water damage on your wood floors from the upper-level\nbathroom. It might seem obvious that wood floors need to be replaced. But the\nwater may have run down the inside of walls where mold could form or drywall\ndamage could occur. This could impact how secure the cabinets are on the\nwalls.\n\n### More Claim Settlement Money\n\nA public adjuster can sometimes land larger settlement claims for their\nclients. As a homeowner, you might not feel it\u2019s your place or even confident\nto go back to the insurance adjuster and negotiate with them about the claim.\n\nCertainly, you might not even recognize the possibility that something has\nbeen missed, so you don\u2019t know to ask for more. Because of their experience, a\npublic adjuster does know to ask. They will then negotiate on your behalf with\nthe insurance company adjuster.\n\n## Cons of Hiring a Public Adjuster\n\nThere are some negatives to consider, and many are associated with the\nreputation of public adjusters. Public adjusters, in some cases, have gained a\nreputation for chasing the money.  \nWhile they will advocate for you as the homeowner, and there is some value to\nthis, there are also some possible negatives to consider.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the negatives associated with public adjusters.\n\n### Many Only Do Major Claims\n\nOne negative of the public adjuster sector is the type of claims they are\nwilling to work with. Many only want to work on large-scale claims like a\ntotal loss house fire, for example. Since they make their money based on the\nfinal settlement amount, they want to work on only the big cases where there\nwould be a big payday for them.\n\nIt might be harder to get a public adjuster involved in a claim worth only a\nfew thousand dollars versus a claim for $20,000 or $200,000. For the\npercentage they get, they might figure the smaller claims aren\u2019t worth it.\nBefore hiring a public adjuster, research the kind of work they do. Ask for\nreferences\n\n### Paying the Public Adjuster\n\nIn theory, you don\u2019t pay the public adjuster out of pocket. They work on a\ncontingency and get paid from the settlement amount they can get for you. The\namount varies from area to area across the country. It also varies depending\non the size of the claim.\n\nIt seems the average is around a 10% fee from the claim settlement. Some\nadjusters will lower their percentage for large cases, knowing the settlement\namount is likely to be big. While some adjusters increase the percentage for\nclaims on the smaller size, hinting they prefer to take those large settlement\ncases instead.\n\n### Time It Takes to Settle\n\nIn some cases, having a public adjuster involved helps move the claim along\nmore quickly. They know the process and work with insurance companies all the\ntime.  \nBut like anything, the more people involved can sometimes slow down the\nprocess. There is likely to be more negotiation back and forth between the\npublic adjuster and the insurance adjuster.\n\nSometimes when a claim can\u2019t be settled, the courts must get involved too.\nWhile they act as your advocate, sometimes, in their effort to raise the claim\namount, the insurance company resists, slowing down the process. The more\nnegotiation there is back and forth, the more time it is likely to take to get\na settlement.\n\n### **Top 10 Questions About Working with a Public Adjuster to File Your\nClaim**\n\n### How do I know if I need a public adjuster to file my claim?\n\nIt\u2019s true that your insurance company has an insurance adjuster to assess the\ndamage from your claim. However, in certain situations, you may want a\nprofessional to advocate for you. Many homeowners decide to hire a public\nadjuster if the damage is extensive or if it\u2019s difficult to determine how much\ndamage has occurred. If you disagree about the cost estimate from your\ncompany\u2019s insurance adjuster.\n\n### When should I hire a public adjuster?\n\nThe claims and repair process can take a significant amount of time. You can\nhire a public adjuster at any time during the process. For instance, if the\nclaim is settled and additional damage is discovered during repairs, you may\nwish to hire a public adjuster to assess the total cost.\n\n### What qualities should I look for in a public adjuster?\n\nIt would be best if you had the same professionalism from a public adjuster as\nany other service. Seek out a reputable company that has been in business for\nseveral years. Your adjuster must be licensed and bonded. He or she should be\nresponsive to your needs and answer any questions you have.\n\n### When is it time to pay the adjuster?\n\nYour public insurance adjuster is paid on contingency. Instead of paying\nupfront, you\u2019ll pay a percentage of the settlement after an agreement is\nreached. After you accept your insurance company\u2019s final payment offer, your\nadjuster will collect a pre-arranged amount. This is usually between 5% and\n15% of your claim.\n\n### What should I expect from my public adjuster?\n\nYour public adjuster should help you with every part of the claim. Your public\nadjuster will assess the damage, determine a cost estimate, and even negotiate\nwith your insurance company on your behalf. It\u2019s your insurance adjuster\u2019s\ngoal to maximize your claim.\n\n### Can my insurance company cancel my policy if I hire a public adjuster?\n\nNo, your insurance company can only cancel your policy for non-payment or\nanother way that you break the terms of your contract. Your insurance company\nwill likely be eager to work with you to reach an agreeable resolution to your\nclaim. Typically, insurance agencies understand the desire to hire an\nadditional advocate and respond professionally when hiring a public adjuster.\n\n### Should I hire a public adjuster before I contact my insurance company\nabout filing my claim?\n\nNo, your insurance policy is designed to provide coverage for damages to your\nhome, and the terms of your policy require you to contact the agency first.\nYou can choose to hire a public adjuster after you contact your insurance\ncompany, or you can wait until you receive a cost estimate from your insurer\u2019s\nadjuster.\n\n### Why should I hire a public adjuster instead of an attorney?\n\nA claims adjuster is trained to assess the damage, provide a cost estimate,\nand negotiate with your insurance company. If you go straight to an attorney,\nyour lawyer will likely hire a public adjuster to investigate the claim.\nYou\u2019ll likely end up paying the cost for both professionals and possibly\nincrease the amount of time it takes to complete the claims process.\n\n### When is it too late to hire a public adjuster to assist with my claim?\n\nOccasionally, after a claim is settled, additional damage is discovered. You\nmay still be able to hire a public adjuster at this time. It\u2019s likely too late\nto involve a public adjuster if you signed a final release or your claim\nperiod has extended beyond the statute of limitations.\n\n### Will hiring a public adjuster help speed up the claims process?\n\nPossibly. Public adjusters are professionals who are required to have a\ncertain amount of knowledge and training. Since they\u2019re already familiar with\nthe process, the necessary steps can be completed quickly.\n\nyou\u2019d like me to focus on, please let me know.

Comparing fees among different adjusters can help you find a fair\nrate.\n\n#### 4\\. **Assess Communication and Availability**\n\nYour public adjuster should be readily available to answer your questions and\nkeep you informed.

Brian was super helpful and easy to\ncommunicate with. I'd definitely recommend him to anyone trying to navigate\nthe insurance marketplace!\n\nMadeline Line\n\n1698691773\n\nI did some hunting online to obtain an auto insurance quote and I couldn't be\nhappier with what Maria did for me. First, I loved that LoPriore had an option\nwhere I could simply upload my existing policy to obtain a quote. Next, Maria\nwas so efficient in getting back to me. Then with her knowledge of insurance\nand her companies to choose from, and this is NOT an exaggeration: saved me\nthousands!! Maria had such sincere empathy for the high premiums we were\nfacing, she went above and beyond to find us a great solution. This experience\nhas truly renewed my faith that there IS indeed personalized customer service\nstill alive and thriving out there. I am so pleased to have found a new\ninsurance agency that I had only online reviews to go by at the start, and\nthat I can without hesitation fully recommend! Do not give it a second\nthought. Move your policies here.\n\nKathy I\n\n1698119096\n\nJohn was extremely responsive and helpful in searching for insurance for our\nthree family condo association. He went above and beyond answering the call on\nthe weekend, looking through our current policy in detail, educating us on\ndifferent options. I highly recommend John and his team.\n\nAlisha Candela\n\n1696361074\n\nRichard was excellent - very helpful in helping us find the best possible BOP\nfor our Condo with Quincy Insurance. Thank you!\n\nIra Lanik\n\n1695934615\n\nBrian Burgess was super easy to work with, and I was able to get a great\npolicy without too much of a change in my premium, even though I went from a\n13 year old car to a brand new car.\n\nTithi Dutta Roy\n\n1690206403\n\nMaria was a professional, courteous, and efficient agent. Within a week of\ninitially contacting her, I received quotes, had all my questions answered,\nhad my policies written, and she notified my previous carrier of cancelation.\nIt was a pleasure working with her.\n\nChad Laliberte\n\n1689254503\n\nFast, accurate, responsive, and knowledgeable!\n\nLynn Thomas\n\n1687787112\n\nHonest, straightforward service for commercial and personal insurance lines.\nI\u2019m a satisfied , long time customer\n\nRamana Lagemann\n\n1685988192\n\nThey have always treated us well and do a great job with our policies.

I was looking for a company\nthat provides master insurance. The prices are much more reasonable than the\ncompany we used to work with.Quick responses. I\u2019m happy I found them.\n\nNina Fine\n\n1683825783\n\nI am so relived I was referred to this insurance company. It is true . . . . .\nyou get what you pay for. I tried all the internet companies first and was\nbombarded by scams and wasted almost a week with ZERO results. I called and\nhad the pleasure of being paired with an excellent agent Brian Burgess. By\nthis time, I was in a complete panic because I couldn't pick up my new car\nfrom the dealership until was insured. I have always had an out-of-state West\nCoast license that was expired. He was so personable, patient, and very\nfriendly. The most important is that he was professional and new exactly how\nto solve the insurance issue. He had my car insured within two hours! He has\ncontinued to follow-up with me through the process. I am going to refer him to\nmy clients and friends.

Got a better price from previous\nagency. Seems like better coverage so far so good\n\nStan Mills\n\n1678895614\n\nFrom the moment I was in contact with LoPriore agent I felt comfortable and\nsecure that I been connected to someone I felt secure speaking with. Made my\ntransition smooth and easy. Thank you!\n\nElizabeth Hardnett\n\n1678464925\n\nIt has been absolute pleasure working with Richard M. and the team at LoPriore\nInsurance. For years we did the direct route with homeowners and auto\ninsurance thinking it would be easier and save us money. In beginning of 2022\nwe converted our multifamily home into condos and couldn't find any agent or\ncompanies willing to work with such a small HOA. I contacted Richard in a\nstate of frustration and confusion and within a couple of hours he provided me\nwith options and pricing. I was shocked at his ability to make the process\nlook so easy compared to others I had been in contact with. Since then, we've\nalso switched our primary residence and auto over their agency and Richard was\nable to get us better policies at a cheaper price! Our days of trying to go\ndirect are behind us - I'm so relieved to have a dependable contact who can\neliminate the confusion on such an important topic. Thank you, Richard, for\nyour guidance and expertise!\n\nJohanna Teahan\n\n1670772058\n\nAmazing service especially during these trying times! Made the process\nseamless and quick! John and Danielle were both great to work with! I highly\nrecommend.\n\nJordan Alexander\n\n1598489201\n\nIt's all about the service baby!  \nLopriore Insurance is the type of agency that shops around for you (the\nclient) getting the best rate and most important, they get you the right\ncoverage.  \nRecently, I had my families commercial property switched over from another\nlocal agency, saving us over 3k with a bunch of extra bells & whistles we\ndidn't even ask for (who does that). This kind of service has me telling my\nfamily and friends to support them because of all they do.\n\nMike Moccia\n\n1556196383\n\nI have appreciated all the help I\u2019ve gotten, especially from Danielle! She\nalways answered my phone calls and emails promptly and streamlined the process\nof getting multiple policies in place for us!\n\nWendy Vaughan\n\n1540557208\n\nWe have been working with LoPriore Insurance Agency for many years for our\nauto, personal and business insurance policies. Being a small business owner,\nit's nice to know that if any issues arise, it only takes a quick phone call\nto have someone help address it. We always feel that we are in good hands with\nJohn and his amazing team!\n\nJudy Hagerty Halloran\n\n1540408200\n\nAdam Griffith is our main man at lopriore insurance. Very efficient and\nhonest! Not just an agent but a trusted advisor. Try and find someone to\nfigure out how to insure a tattoo shop within a barber shop?? You would think\nit\u2019s not possible, but Adam made it happen.\n\nRobert Dello Russo\n\n1540405447\n\nJohn and his team are the best.  \nI use them for all my insurance needs, auto, home and business.  \nCompanies that I work with are always impressed on how quickly they respond to\nall our insurance needs.  \n  \nTry LoPriore insurance, you will not be disappointed\n\nJohn R. Micieli\n\n1540331621\n\nI send all my clients to LoPriore Insurance, I have received nothing but\npositive feedback both on price and service ! Keep up the great work\nJohn,Maria and Co.\n\nPeter Camplin\n\n1539883859\n\nI couldnt imagine doing my insurance anywhere else! Theyre the best!\n\nMarina Perez Lanza\n\n1539209640\n\nI got into an accident a little over a month ago. My agent Danielle was very\nhelpful. She was always able to answer my questions, if I couldn't reach\nanyone from safety she was able to contact them and have them get back to me\nright away. When I had to go to the office and do paperwork work all of the\nemployees were very nice and helpful. I highly recommend this agency.\n\nKristy Marie\n\n1538484673\n\nI have met many people in the Insurance industry, over my career of\ntransacting Real Estate, and as a Broker/Owner of a firm. None, have made\nthemselves so invaluable that I call them first without question, except for\nLopriore. They offer consistently great service and rates, and help my clients\nwith timely advice.  \n  \nI trust them with my most valuable assets -- my clients, and my reputation.  \n  \nThank you for helping my clients, and my business!  \n  \nSean Callahan - Broker/Owner Callahan Real Estate\n\nSean Callahan\n\n1526074049\n\n5 stars!! A family member of mine suggested that I call there insurance guy\nJohn at LoPriore Insurance to get a better quote on my current insurance. When\nI called John he was very easy to work with and extremely helpful. I couldn't\nbe happier with how easy and fast it was to get a quote of my current policy\nwhich included a renters policy and it was all offered for $1200 less per\nyear. After years of being insured by another insurance agency I always\nthought all prices were the same buying from insurance agencies.  \nTo my surprise this wasn't the case and I can't be happier I was referred to\nthe insurance guy!! I Also want to thank Maria at insurance office that made\nit simple to transfer and sign up with my new insurance. I literally did this\nall thru my iPhone and signed my paperwork via my phone which made the change\nso simple. I highly recommend you contacting them and seeing what they offer\nyou!\n\nAngela Bognanno\n\n1520269176\n\n\u2039\n\n\u203a\n\n## Ready to Get Started?\n\nGet Top Rated Insurance Coverage at the Best Price!\n\nContact One of Our Agents!\n\nNeed Immediate Help?\n\n### CALL US TODAY\n\n### 781-438-1375\n\nContact Lopriore insurance and save\n\nWE MAKE INSURANCE EASY\n\nSTART A QUOTE\n\nTALK TO AN AGENT\n\nAbout LoPriore Insurance\n\nLoPriore Insurance Agency is a proud Trusted Choice agent dedicated to\nproviding competitive insurance products and personalized service to our\nvaluable clients.
