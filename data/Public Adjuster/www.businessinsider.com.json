They help shield you from the economic risks associated with\neverything from floods, earthquakes, and wildfires to arson, theft, and\nvandalism. Insurance policies are legal agreements describing what losses are\ncovered and at what amounts.\n\nInsurers rely on staff or independently-contracted adjusters to evaluate each\nclaim. But as a policyholder, you have the right to use a public adjuster,\nsomeone who is unaffiliated with the insurance company and therefore free to\nfully work on your behalf.\n\nCompare Auto Insurance Policies\n\nAnswer a few simple questions, and Insure.com will match you with companies in\nyour area.\n\nPlease enter a valid zipcode.\n\nGo Get Quotes\n\nPowered by :  \n\nWhat is a public adjuster?  Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or\nmenu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n\nA public adjuster is an insurance professional hired directly by a\npolicyholder. They have the same skills and training as other claims adjusters\nbut are free from any loyalty to insurance companies. If insurance companies\ndon't use an adjuster from their staff, they'll likely use an independent\nadjuster. But don't be misled by that title. Independent adjusters are simply\ncontractors hired by and working for the insurance company.  \n\nPublic adjusters work for individual policyholders. They are state-\ncredentialed professionals trained to interpret policies, document and\nevaluate losses, and in many states can help negotiate a settlement. They can\ntake over for you when you're overwhelmed or simply don't have the time or\nenergy to deal with filing a claim. They work exclusively for you to get the\nmoney you are rightfully owed.\n\nWhat does a public adjuster do?  Chevron icon It indicates an expandable\nsection or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n\nPublic adjusters can assist you with any of the three main phases of an\ninsurance claim: itemizing the loss, figuring out how much money it will take\nto do repairs or rebuild, and negotiating a settlement.\n\nThe technical terminology of policies and the math involved in the claims\nprocess can befuddle already distraught and drained policyholders. Public\nadjusters can help read your policy for you, explain it in layman's terms,\norganize the process, and document your losses and needs.\n\n\"Many people describe the claim process after a serious loss, a wildfire or a\nhurricane, as a second disaster,\" says Amy Bach, co-founder and executive\ndirector of United Policyholders, a California-based nonprofit organization.\n\n\"A good public adjuster takes the burden off of the loss victim to value their\nloss, and to obtain every dollar that they are entitled to from their\ninsurance company,\" Bach says.\n\nPublic adjusters can be especially useful when a claim is very large or very\ncomplex, as is common with natural disasters like wildfires, earthquakes or\nfloods. While they generally cannot negotiate a settlement greater than your\npolicy limits, there are exceptions.\n\n **\"** Often times there are additional coverages hidden in the language of\nthe policy that you have to understand the policy and understand what's\nnecessary in order to collect the amount over and above the policy limits,\"\nsays Anita Taff, owner of Georgia-based Taff Claims Services and president of\nthe National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters.\n\n##  **Insurance claims adjusters vs. public adjusters**\n\nInsurance claims adjusters are paid and trained by the insurance company.\nTheir loyalty is to the insurer, not the policyholder. Because public\nadjusters work for the policyholder, they don't have the same conflicts of\ninterest. Instead of trying to keep a payout low, they work to achieve the\nbest settlement possible.\n\n **\"** We have a fiduciary responsibility to protect the interest of the\npolicyholder. The other two adjusters protect the interests of the insurance\ncompany,\" Taff says.\n\n  \n\n#\n\nZIP Code:\n\nAge: 35-44\n\n18-20\n\n21-24\n\n25-34\n\n35-44\n\n45-54\n\n55-64\n\n65+\n\nCurrent Insurer: Other\n\nNot Currently Insured\n\n21st Century\n\nAAA Insurance\n\nAllstate\n\nEsurance\n\nFarmers Insurance\n\nGeico\n\nHartford Insurance\n\nLiberty Mutual\n\nNationwide\n\nProgressive\n\nState Farm\n\nTravelers Insurance\n\nMetLife\n\nSAFECO\n\nUSAA\n\nOther\n\nGood Credit\n\nSubmit\n\nUpdating...\n\nCompany\n\nInfo\n\nGet Quote\n\n  \n\nCheapest Home Insurance in Santa Clara, CA\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn AgileRates's site\n\nHome Insurance in Santa Clara, CA - Save $569/Year\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn QuotesMatch's site\n\nGet the Best Home Insurance Rates in California\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn DMS Insurance's site\n\nCompare Renters Insurance\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn Peklava LLC's site\n\nLowest Rates in CA\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn Blue Sky Coverage's site\n\nCompare Multiple Rates in Seconds\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn Insurance.io (SmartFinancial)'s site\n\nSeeking the Perfect Home Insurance?\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn SmartFinancial Insurance's site\n\nHow much does a public adjuster cost?  Chevron icon It indicates an expandable\nsection or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n\nInsurance claims adjusters come at no extra cost to the policyholder. They are\npaid by the insurance company. Public adjusters, on the other hand, are paid\non a contingency basis, earning a pre-agreed upon percentage of the\npolicyholder's settlement.  \n\nPublic adjusters may charge between 5% to 20% of your final settlement,\ndepending on the amount of work involved and the complexity of the claim. Some\nstates limit how much a public adjuster may charge.\n\nWhat are the benefits of working with a public adjuster?  Chevron icon It\nindicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next\nnavigation options.\n\nPublic adjusters \"speak the language and they can take a burden off of you\nbecause the process is time consuming and there's a lot of technical\nterminology that can be tricky to navigate,\" says Bach, an attorney who co-\nfounded United Policyholders in 1991 after an urban wildfire in Northern\nCalifornia.\n\nMore recently, United Policyholders has been helping people through the\naftermath of the Marshall wildfire in Boulder, Colorado. The organization\nseeks to level the playing field between insurers and the insured.\n\nIn addition to streamlining the process for policyholders, public adjusters\ncan help net larger settlements.  \n\n\"We are always getting a higher settlement than what individuals or business\nowners typically get when they negotiate their own insurance claims _,\"_ says\nTaff, who works to ensure policyholders understand their rights and\nobligations and the nuances of each section of their policy.\n\nFor example, they may not know that their policy has additional limits\navailable for getting rid of damaged material, say, after a fire. \"If you need\nall the money to rebuild your structure and you don't have enough money in\nyour policy limits for the debris removal, there is an additional amount of\nmoney available for that,\" Taff says.\n\nAccording to a January 2010 report from Florida's Office of Program Policy\nAnalysis and Government Accountability, policyholders who hired public\nadjusters to settle claims after hurricanes in 2005 received payments that\nwere 747% higher than those who didn't. Those who used public adjusters for\nnon-catastrophic claims received settlements that were 584% higher, according\nto the report. The amount ultimately received by a policyholder would be less,\nas the data doesn't adjust reflect the public adjusters' fees.\n\nHow do I hire a public adjuster?  Chevron icon It indicates an expandable\nsection or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\n\nTo hire a public adjuster, you can start by doing a directory search for your\nstate through the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters.\n\nOnce you have a name, do your due diligence. Verify that the public adjuster\nis a member of their state's trade association, which will have ethics codes.\nCheck your state's division of insurance for any disciplinary actions or\nreports. Ask for references, and ask friends and colleagues for\nrecommendations.\n\nAlso ask the adjuster how many clients they have. If they are too busy, they\nwon't invest as much time on your behalf. Also, research your state's\nregulations to find out if there are limits to how much a public adjuster can\ncharge.\n\nFinally, be wary of an adjuster who shows up uninvited, or who uses high\npressure tactics.\n\n##  **The bottom line**\n\nIf you have the time, energy, and ability to evaluate and catalog your losses,\nevaluate the cost of returning your property to the condition it was in before\nthe loss, and can closely read your policy to understand your rights and\nobligations, you may not need a public adjuster. But if you are worn out,\noverwhelmed or unsure of what you're owed, a public adjuster can do the work\nfor you and may be able to negotiate a higher settlement.\n\nJill Burke\n\nJill Burke\n\nJill Burke is an Edward R.
