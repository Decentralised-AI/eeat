They\nare not employed by the insurance company; they work on the homeowner\u2019s\nbehalf. A claims adjuster negotiates with the insurance company in order to\nobtain a fair settlement to get the property back to its prior condition\nbefore the property loss took place.\n\nFrom the moment you call until the very last claim check has been sent out, a\npublic adjuster is there to handle the _entire_ claims process. They are\nlicensed professionals who will work on your behalf and handle any and all\ncommunications with the insurance carrier, conduct inspections of the\nproperty, and advise you on what should or shouldn\u2019t be done to fix your\nproperty.\n\n## What Kind Of Claims Can A Public Adjuster Handle?\n\nA public adjuster can handle all property damage insurance claims. This means\nthey work with homeowners, investment property owners, and business owners\nwhen there is damage to the building or contents inside of it. Public\nadjusters advocate for the insured to ensure they receive proper compensation\nfor their insurance claim. At Performance Adjusting we help with:\n\n  * __ Fire Damage\n  * __ Soot & Smoke Damage\n  * __ Water Damage\n  * __ Mold Damage\n  * __ Wind & Storm Damage\n  * __ Roof Leak Damage\n  * __ Vandalism\n  * __ Business Interruption\n  * __ Vehicle Strike/Collision Damage\n  * __ Ice Dam Damage\n  * __ Plumbing Leak Damage\n\nPublic adjusters can be hired right after the damage occurs or even after a\nhomeowner has filed a claim. Hiring a claims adjuster will ensure that an\ninsured will receive a fair settlement from their insurance company.\n\n## What's The Difference Between A Public Adjuster, A Company Adjuster, and An\nIndependent Adjuster?\n\nAlthough these three titles sound very similar and self-explanatory, there is\na huge difference between leaving it up to your company or independent\nadjuster and using a public adjuster when you have property damage.\n\n### What Is A Company Adjuster?\n\nCompany adjusters work directly for a particular insurance company. A company\nadjuster will visit your home to assess all damages and losses from any peril\nthat may have occurred. A company adjuster will come after your claim has been\ncalled in and will provide an estimate to the insurance company they work for.\nGiven that a company adjuster works for the insurance company, they do not go\nthe extra mile to ensure the insured has enough money to repair their\nproperty. The payout of a claim may be _extremely different_ depending on\nwhether you use the adjuster provided by insurance carriers or a public\nadjusting firm.\n\n### What Is An Independent Insurance Adjuster?\n\nAn independent insurance adjuster is an adjuster who works for an insurance\ncompany to settle claims. Unlike a company adjuster, they are subcontractors\nand are hired on a per claim basis. Given that an independent adjuster is\nhired by the insurance company, they do not have the insured in mind when\nconducting their assessment. Independent adjusters do not detail a claim as a\npublic adjuster would, which may lead to an insufficient settlement.\n\n## When Should I Hire A Public Adjuster?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t go to court without a lawyer, so don\u2019t file a property insurance\nclaim without a public adjuster. Regardless of the size of the damage, a\npublic adjuster will be able to help you with your claim. You have homeowners\ninsurance for a reason, so you shouldn\u2019t leave it up to your insurance\ncompany\u2019s adjuster.\n\nEven what seems like a small amount of damage, can be a lot larger than you\nwould think. Like this picture to the right, it may look like a small leak\ncoming through the ceiling from a burst pipe. But what about replacing the\nceiling? Or the contents (personal property) the water has damaged? Or maybe\nthat water yields secondary damage such as mold?\n\nPublic adjusters will not take more than the agreed-upon fee so that you can\nuse the total cost of the damage to fix your property. You will forget about\nthe small fee once you receive your insurance settlement check!\n\nIt is _important_ to know the extent of your property damage. What may seem\nsmall could be a fairly large claim in the end. A public adjuster can assess\nthis for you, look at your insurance policy, and determine if you should file\na claim.\n\n## What If I Already Filed A Claim?\n\nEven if you\u2019ve already filed a claim, _you can still hire a public adjuster to\nrepresent you_. It\u2019s almost never too late to get the help you need from\npublic adjusters to obtain a proper settlement from your insurance company.\n\nMany public adjusters offer a free assessment of your property damage, so you\ncan get an idea of what to expect from the claim and how much it will payout.\n\n## Should I Use A Public Adjuster If I Already Got Paid? (And Didn't Get\nEnough Money)\n\nThe _final_ settlement check doesn\u2019t actually mean _final!_ Depending on how\nlong ago your date of loss was (the day you had the property damage) and the\nstatute of limitations in your state, you can still reopen your claim by using\npublic insurance adjusters. By doing so, you\u2019ll be able to retrieve the money\nyou need to fix your damages even after you\u2019ve been paid by your insurance\ncompany.\n\nHiring a public insurance adjuster is the best way to make sure you get all of\nyour money from insurance claims. Insurance companies aren\u2019t always on your\nside, but public insurance adjusters will be!\n\n## How Much Does A Public Adjuster Cost?\n\nNot only are public adjusters hired to get you the most money to benefit you,\nbut it also benefits the adjuster. Public adjusters take on average 10% of the\nfinal settlement. Although sometimes you\u2019ll see higher fees, up to 20%!\nNothing comes out of pocket and nothing gets taken away from the money you\nneed to fix your home or business back to pre-loss conditions. It makes sense\nto hire a public adjuster even though they cost a small percentage because\npublic adjusters can often get you more money than an insurance company.\n\nPublic adjusters are there to help you every step of the way, and they should\nbe able to tell you if it\u2019s worth filing an insurance claim or not.\n\n## How Do Public Adjusters Determine Damage?\n\nPublic insurance adjusters use high-quality technology and proven techniques\nto uncover even the smallest damage for smaller claims. They\u2019ll use tools like\nmoisture meters, laser tapes, soot sponges, and more to find everything that\nyour insurance company should pay out for your claim.\n\nWhen claim adjusters go through a property, they make sure to look at every\ndetail. They\u2019ll be looking for things like fire damage, smoke stains, water\ndamage from burst pipes or flooding, wind damage from storms with high winds\nthat may have torn roofs off homes or ripped trees out of the ground, and\nother signs of damage.\n\nFrom taking pictures to going through the entire property room by room, public\nadjusters will make sure that your insurance company knows exactly what\nhappened and how much it\u2019s going to take to fix everything.\n\n## When Should I Use A Lawyer To Fight My Insurance Company?\n\nWhen dealing with property damage, sometimes a policyholder hires an attorney\nor a lawyer to fight their claim instead of a licensed public adjuster. Most\nof the time it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know that they have the option to hire a\npublic insurance adjuster.\n\nThe only reasonable time to hire a lawyer for your insurance claim is if it is\ndenied or you believe the insurance carrier has demonstrated _bad faith_. If\nyour claim is denied, we as public adjusters can\u2019t do anything about it. A\nlawyer can help you with this. If your claim is not denied, hiring a public\nadjuster is your best bet. It is more cost-effective and generally a better\nidea than the hassle and a higher fee associated with hiring a lawyer.\n\n## What Should You Expect When Hiring A Public Adjuster?\n\nWhen you choose to hire a public adjuster, they will work on the claim\npersonally, comparing cost estimates with the insurance company\u2019s insurance\nclaims adjusters. Here is our process:\n\n### Insurance Claim Process\n\n  * __\n\n#### Insurance Policy Review\n\nOur licensed public adjusters will look at your insurance policy to determine\nhow we can help you recover financially.\n\n  * __\n\n#### Temporary Relocation\n\nIf you need a place to stay, we will find one.

Seriously. You\nwon\u2019t get a phone call, text, or email (Unless we need to reach you).\n\n  * __\n\n#### Fight\n\nInsurance companies can be pesky when you try to get them to pay for your\ndamages, but we won\u2019t back down. We will fight for every aspect of your claim,\nincluding dwelling (the physical structure of your home), other structures on\nyour property (fences, sheds, garages), damaged contents, business income, and\nloss of use (additional living expenses, business interruption, etc.).\n\n## How To Pick A Public Adjuster?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to find a public adjuster near you.
