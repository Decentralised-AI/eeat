Public Adjusters\n\n###  Commercial Property\n\n  * Definitions\n\n  * Public Adjusters\n\n  * Vandalism and Looting Damage\n\n#  Commercial Property Insurance Public Adjusters\n\nFires and natural disasters are unforeseen and unpredictable, and the recovery\nprocess can be overwhelming. If your property or home was insured you will\nhave to work through your company\u2019s claims process, and you may be approached\nby an \u201cinsurance adjuster\u201d who claims he or she can obtain a more favorable\nsettlement from your insurance company. You should always be suspicious of any\nindividual offering a service or benefit that sounds or appears \u201ctoo good to\nbe true\u201d and contact the Department before entering into a contract or formal\nagreement that raises questions or suspicion.\n\nThis fact sheet provides information about public adjusters and answers some\nfrequently asked questions.\n\n  * What is an adjuster?\n  * Do I have to hire a public adjuster to deal with my insurance company?\n  * Is a public adjuster\u2019s fee covered in my insurance policy?\n  * How does a public adjuster get paid?\n  * Are public adjuster fees negotiable?\n  * Who will my insurance company work with after I hire a public adjuster?\n  * Do I have to sign a contract with a public adjuster?\n  * Are there restrictions on when a public adjuster can solicit me?\n  * Are there standards of conduct that a public adjuster must follow?\n  * Does a public adjuster have to be licensed?\n  * Where can I find more information?\n\n### What is an adjuster?\n\nThere are three types of insurance adjusters:\n\n\n\n  * A \u201ccompany adjuster\" is an employee of your insurance company. They represent the interest of the insurance company and are paid by the insurance company. They will not charge you a fee.\n  * An \u201cindependent adjuster\" is hired on a contract basis by your insurance company to represent the insurance company's interest in the settlement of your claim. They are paid by your insurance company. They will not charge you a fee.\n  * A \u201cpublic adjuster\" does not work for any insurance company, is not a public employee, and does not work on behalf of the State of Illinois, Department of Insurance, or any other public agency. They work for you to assist in the preparation, presentation and settlement of your claim. You hire a public adjuster by signing a contract agreeing to pay a fee or commission based on a percentage of your settlement, or other method of compensation.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Do I have to hire a public adjuster to deal with my insurance company?\n\nNo. Many consumer find that the services offered by public adjusters can be\nperformed, for free, by trained insurance company staff. You may wish to speak\nwith Department staff before engaging the services of a public adjuster.\n\n\n\nYour insurance company also has knowledgeable claim adjusters who are\navailable to assist you with the claim process.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Is a public adjuster\u2019s fee covered in my insurance policy?\n\nNo. Insurance policies do not cover the fees of a public adjuster.\n\nback to top __\n\n### How does a public adjuster get paid?\n\nYou must pay for the services provided by a public adjuster. Typically, public\nadjuster\u2019s charge a fee equal to a certain percentage of the claim paid by\nyour insurance company. In other words, after your insurance company settles\nyour insurance claim, the public adjuster could take a percentage of that\nsettlement.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Are public adjuster fees negotiable?\n\nYes. All fees charged by the public adjuster can and should be negotiated.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Who will my insurance company work with after I hire a public adjuster?\n\nOnce you sign a contract with a public adjuster, the public adjuster will\nnotify your insurance company, who will then send all correspondence to your\npublic adjuster. You should ask the public adjuster to routinely update you on\nthe progress of your claim. The insurance proceeds will be sent to you and you\nmust then give the adjuster the fee that you agreed to on the contract with\nhim.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Do I have to sign a contract with a public adjuster?\n\nYes. Illinois law requires the public adjuster to provide you with a written\ncontract which has been approved by the Director of Insurance.The contract\nshould specify the services the public adjuster will provide for you and any\nsalary, fee, commission, compensation or other consideration he or she will\nreceive for those services. The contract you sign with the public adjuster is\nbinding and can only be canceled by certified mail within 5 business days\nafter the date the contract was signed.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Are there restrictions on when a public adjuster can solicit me?\n\nYes. A public adjuster cannot solicit you while a \u201closs-producing occurrence,\u201d\nsuch as a fire, is continuing or while the fire department or its\nrepresentatives are engaged at your property. A public adjuster is also\nprohibited from soliciting your business between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and\n8:00 a.m. If a public adjuster approaches you during these times you should\nreport him or her to the Department.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Are there standards of conduct that a public adjuster must follow?\n\nYes. A public adjuster is required to serve with objectivity and complete\nloyalty for your interests alone and to render to you such information,\ncounsel, and service as will best serve your insurance claim needs and\ninterests.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Does a public adjuster have to be licensed?\n\nYes. Illinois law requires public adjusters to be licensed with the Department\nof Insurance. Contact the Department at (866) 445-5364 to verify that the\npublic adjuster is licensed and in good standing before signing any contract.\n\nback to top __\n\n### Where can I find more information?\n\nUseful information on insurance coverage and how to handle the insurance\nclaims process can be found in the Department\u2019s consumer fact sheet entitled\n\u201cWhen Disaster Strikes \u2013 What to do After an Insured Homeowners Loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrained insurance professionals are also available to assist you for free at\nthe Department of Insurance, which can be reached toll-free at (866) 445-5364.\n\n## Footer\n\nBack to top __\n\n### Offices\n\nIllinois Department of Insurance  \n122 S.
