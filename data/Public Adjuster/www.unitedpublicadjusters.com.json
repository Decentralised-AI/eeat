My home in Mount Sinai suffered a significant water damage loss and Michael and his team worked tirelessly in representing me. They had excellent communication skills, responding very quickly to my frequent inquiries. They know the industry very well and will fiercely negotiate on your behalf to get what you are entitled to. I now understand how important it is to work with someone who is knowledgeable in this area because the average person or contractor could easily miss so many details Michael and his team caught. I don\u2019t know how I would have gotten through this nightmare without them! AMAZING job!\n\nKarina Jockers\n\n  * United Public Adjusters are absolutely fantastic! A++. Michael Maltaghati and James Southard guided us step by step and had expeditious communication throughout the entire process! United Public Adjusters, Michael and James proved to be reliable, thorough, fierce negotiators and highly knowledgeable. They helped us through a water damage loss and we are immensely appreciative. 100% recommend their services. Thank you!!!\n\nCollier Castaway\n\n  * Wonderful. They are worth every penny by taking the nerve wracking interactions with your insurance company off your list of things to do \u2013 they do it. And they get you more than if you went it alone. They know the business, the issues, and the people. Highly recommended!!!!\n\nDoug Russell\n\n  * They helped me a lot and they are profesional..definitely advised.\n\nKuddusi Sevimli\n\n  * Mike Maltagati went above and beyond for me and my family during a very trying time. He will get you what you deserve. The insurance adjusters are difficult but Mike made the claims process much easier dealing with the insurance company on your behalf. Thank you Mike.\n\nC Paolucci\n\n  * Delorenzo was beyond helpful to us and did above and beyond our expectations. He listened to our concerns and addressed everything plus things we never even thought of. I would highly recommend him to my friends, family and anyone who\u2019s suffered a loss. His due diligence as far as timing went was impeccable, we are now more than happily continuing to live our best lives \u2013 luckily still in our forever home.\n\nBlake James\n\n  * When my home in Jamaica, Queens caught on fire, Michael and his team arrived on-site within only an hour after the incident. Obviously being our first time dealing with said situation it was extremely confusing and stressful, but my family and I knew we were in good hands. Michael took the time to thoroughly explain next steps including claim submission, restoration and mitigation, and even temporary relocation. I would strongly recommend!\n\nThad Mangar\n\n  * I was extremely lucky to have someone refer me to Michael Maltaghati from United Public Adjusters. Back in June, driving home from my son\u2019s baseball game, I returned home to find the side of my house in smoke, tons of firefighters and all my neighbors standing outside. Because of water damage, my house was almost entirely gutted. Thanks to Michael and his experience, reliability and most importantly, his insurance knowledge, I was left with little to no stress. I am in the process of rebuilding a beautiful new house and I owe it to Michael and his team!\n\nJudith Friedman\n\n  * True experts \u2013 they gave my family great advice and handled a claim and it lead to a much better outcome than if we handled the stressful situation alone. I highly recommend them.\n\nBrad Caracciola\n\n  * I would recommend this company to anyone who needs to put in an home owners claim. We had a house fire July 2018. The whole house had to be rebuild except the frame. It was an extremely traumatic experience, however having United Public adjusters on our side made it so much easier. We put everything to do with the insurance company in their hands. They were outstanding. They handled everything from helping us to housing, restoration, but most importantly reassuring us that we will get everything to get back into our home. Fast forward 7 months I\u2019m sitting back in my home after the whole house was redone and I never had to deal with the insurance company. They were able to get me everything I needed from my claim, from the rebuild and my contents.\n\nDonna McCay\n\n  * United Public Adjusters handled my claim when I had a fridge line fail. My house was flooded and I did not know the proper steps to get my home back to a normal living standard in a timely manner. Mike, Anthony, and James from United were there every step of the way to make sure all of my contents were properly documented and hand held me through the process to ensure the insurance carrier gave me the proper amount to bring my home back to the way it was. They answered all my calls and questions with professionalism and allowed me to get back into my home.\n\nChris Occhipinti\n\n  * Last year my family suffered a major house fire. We were recommended to Anthony DeLorenzo. Anthony made sure we had a place to stay and walked us throughout the whole process from day one. What amazed me most was how he accounted for literally every toothpick of personal items in the home. With his help, we were able to navigate through the claims process quickly and efficiently. Anthony\u2019s ability to constantly communicate even on nights and weekends always gave my family peace of mind as the claim moved forward. The insurance company adjusters are not your advocates. People need to realize having your own private adjuster is key. Kudos to Anthony and the team at United for getting the job done for my family as our newly constructed home is amazing. Thanks guys!!\n\nMatthew Bicknese\n\n  * Mike of United Public Adjusters was recommended by a contractor friend who had verified results in a timely fashion and with the least amount of Insurance Company run-a-round for the homeowner. He made all the calls and set up the inspections. He pointed out to the company adjuster many, many things that they would have overlooked. Mike knows how Insurance Companies think! Yes, I would highly recommend the team at United Public Adjusters for any large claim. Thanks again, Mike.\n\nJ B\n\n  * On August 4, 2020, during the storm Isiais an 80 foot tall oak tree was blown over from it\u2019s roots and crashed through my home in Manhasset. It did very significant damage to the whole house and fell with such force that it even cracked the foundation Having no experience in dealing with this type of claim, I turned to United Public Adjusters for their guidance and expertise. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the result. Mike Maltaghati and his team, including James, have been terrific. Their knowledge of the intricacies and details of the construction process and negotiating skill in dealing with the insurance company were invaluable. They are true professionals who walked us through the process and kept us fully informed every step of the way. They were also always available to answer any questions we may have had in a complete and understandable way. I am convinced they obtained the best possible settlement we could have received from the insurance company. I would never think of using anyone else in this type of situation and give them my highest recommendation to anyone who may require the services of a Public Adjuster.\n\nJoseph Bzezinski\n\nFor Immediate Help: 1-800-718-LOSS\n\nOr Click Here for a Free Consultation\n\n  \nPhone:  \n1-800-718-5677  \n  \nEmail:  \nhelp@unitedpublicadjusters.com\n\n### Locations\n\nHeadquarters:  \n150 Broadhollow Road, Suite 213  \nMelville, NY 11747\n\nQueens Office:  \n134-02 Cross Bay Boulevard, Second Floor  \nOzone Park, NY 11417\n\n### Sitemap\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Claims\n  * Industries\n  * Resources\n  * Service Areas\n  * Referral Program\n  * Contact Us\n\n________\n\n\u00a9 2023 United Public Adjusters & Appraisers, Inc. | Florida License #W364451 |\nSitemap | Designed by Long Island SEO\n\n __\n\nWe are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.\n\nYou can find out more about which cookies we are using or switch them off in\nsettings.\n\nAccept\n\nClose GDPR Cookie Settings\n\n  * Privacy Overview\n  * Strictly Necessary Cookies\n\nPowered by  GDPR Cookie Compliance\n\nPrivacy Overview\n\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user\nexperience possible.
