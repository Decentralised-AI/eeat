Ask for recommendations from family and associates. Make sure the adjuster is licensed in the state where your loss has occurred, and call the Better Business Bureau and/or your state insurance department to check up on his or her record.\n  * **Avoid any public adjuster who pressures you** and, as always, read your contract carefully to make sure you understand it all before you sign.\n  * **Know the facts after a major disaster.** Your state\u2019s insurance department may set the percentage that public adjusters are permitted charge. Be wary of public adjusters who go from door-to-door after a catastrophe.  \n\n\n**Next steps:  Learn how to file a homeowners claim**\n\nBack to top\n\n## You May Also Like\n\n     Homeowners + Renters Insurance  \nHow is the settlement amount determined?\n\n     Publications  \nSettling insurance claims after a disaster\n\nConnect With Us\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  * Main\n  * Insurance: The Basics\n  * Research + Data\n  * Resource Center\n\n  * En Espa\u00f1ol\n  * Conceptos B\u00e1sicos de Seguros\n\n  * Blogs\n  * Resilience Accelerator\n  * The Triple-I Blog\n\n  * Membership\n  * Learn More About Membership\n  * Register for a Member Account\n\n  * Amplify\n  * Learn More About Amplify\n\n  * More\n  * About the I.I.I.\n  * Advertising Opportunities\n  * Industry Directory\n  * Permissions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Copyright Policy\n  * Site Map\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023, Insurance Information Institute, Inc.  \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n  Close\n\n## Sign In\n\nPlease sign in to access member exclusive content.\n\nEmail Address *\n\nEnter your username (email)\n\nPassword *\n\nEnter your password.\n\nForgot Password?\n\n### Don't Have an Account?  \nRegister Now\n\nLearn more about membership\n\n* * *\n\n",
