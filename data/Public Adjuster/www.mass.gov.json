Public Insurance Adjusters\n\n  * This page, Public Insurance Adjusters, is  offered by \n  * Division of Insurance\n  * show  more\n  * Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation\n\n#  Public Insurance Adjusters\n\nFollowing a disaster, an insurance adjuster can help homeowners in navigating\nthe claims process and obtaining the maximum claim for damaged property.\n\nAn insurance company may have its own adjusters or hire independent ones and\ntheir services are performed free of charge. In Massachusetts, consumers also\nhave the choice of hiring a public insurance adjuster. Public insurance\nadjusters are licensed by the Division of Insurance (DOI). They are not\naffiliated with any particular insurer and charge a fee for their services,\nwhich may be up to 10% of the final recovery from the insurer.\n\nWhen filing a property claim after a disaster, it is rarely a bad idea to\nemploy a public insurance adjuster. However, it\u2019s important that consumers\nremember scammers may pose as licensed professionals to take advantage of them\nin the aftermath of a disaster, when emotions and stress are typically\nheightened. They may charge an upfront fee and disappear without handling the\nclaim, refer repairs to dishonest contractors for a kickback which may result\nin poor quality repairs, or file false or inflated claims against the policy.\n\nMinimize your risk of getting scammed by a fake or unscrupulous public\nadjuster by:\n\n  * Checking that they hold a current public insurance adjuster\u2019s license with the DOI.\n  * Checking their reputation. Are there any complaints on file about the adjuster or their services with the DOI? It\u2019s also wise to check online review sites and forums, such as the Better Business Bureau, to see if there are any reviews or complaints.\n  * Asking around. Have your friends and neighbors needed a public insurance adjuster in the past? Is there someone they recommend? Does the adjuster you intend to hire have references who might be willing to speak with you?\n  * Having a signed and dated contract that outlines the services provided and the adjuster\u2019s fee. And keep in mind that if you hire a licensed public adjuster to handle your claim and then change your mind, state law allows cancel your contract within 3 days, subject to any emergency expenses paid by the adjuster during those three days (this language should also be in your contract, in bold type!)\n  * Hiring a registered contractor for repairs. If your adjuster recommends a contractor they\u2019ve worked with, check their registration status and complaint, arbitration, and guaranty fund histories with the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation. Never hire a contractor who isn\u2019t registered and be sure their registration is current at the time you sign your contract with them.\n\n\n\n## Related\n\n  * Check a home improvement contractor registration \n\n## Related\n\n  * Check a home improvement contractor registration \n\n## Help Us Improve Mass.gov with your feedback\n\nDid you find what you were looking for on this webpage?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nIf you have any suggestions for the website, please let us know.
