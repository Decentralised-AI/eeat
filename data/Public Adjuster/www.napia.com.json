A public\nadjuster inspects the loss site immediately, analyzes the damages, assembles\nclaim support data, reviews the insured's coverage, determines current\nreplacement costs and exclusively serves the client, not the insurance\ncompany.  \n  \nMany NAPIA public adjusting firms have a long history of service to insureds\nand are very experienced in handling first party property insurance claims.\nMembers are guided by a strict code of ethics and rules of professional\nconduct.\n\n  \n\n  * What is a Public Adjuster \n    * Claims a Public Adjuster Can Help With\n    * Why Use a Public Adjuster?\n  * NAPIA Leadership \n  * FAQ's \n\n## Important Links\n\n**See schedule for upcoming events  \n  \nLearn about membership  \n  \nDo you have your SPPA?  \n  \nDonate to the Legislative Fund  \n  \nState Insurance Departments  \n  \nDisaster Assistance**\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  * NAPIA  \n1400 Village Square Blvd, Suite 3, #187  \nTallahassee, FL 32312-1231\n\n  * Tel: (703) 433-9217\n  * E-Mail: info@napia.com\n\n  \n  \n\nNaylor Association Management Software\n\n",
