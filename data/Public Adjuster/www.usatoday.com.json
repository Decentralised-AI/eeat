Public adjusters differ\nfrom adjusters employed by insurance companies in that they are independent\nprofessionals who advocate for policyholders.\n\nNot all policyholders need to hire a public adjuster when filing a claim, but\nunderstanding the role this type of professional plays can help you make an\ninformed decision.\n\n## What does a public adjuster do?\n\nPublic adjusters assist you with the claims process, providing expertise and\nhelping to get a fair payout amount based on damages and your home insurance\ncoverage.\n\nSome tasks these professionals commonly perform include:\n\n  * Review your home insurance policy to determine which types of coverage apply and whether you can file a claim based on those coverages.\n  * Evaluate and detail all damages to your property, including estimates for repairs or replacements and the timeline for necessary work.\n  * Research claim deadlines and file all required paperwork and documentation on time.\n  * Liaise between you, your insurance company and any others involved, such as lawyers.\n  * Update you on the process and track your claim as it moves through the insurance company\u2019s system.\n  * Negotiate the claim settlement with the insurance company on your behalf.\n\n> **Tip:** Keep in mind that a public adjuster cannot get you more money than\n> is outlined in your insurance policy. For example, if your dwelling coverage\n> limit is $250,000 and the damage to the structure of your house is more than\n> $400,000, your public adjuster cannot negotiate past the limit.\n\n  \n\n#\n\nZIP Code:\n\nAge: 35-44\n\n18-20\n\n21-24\n\n25-34\n\n35-44\n\n45-54\n\n55-64\n\n65+\n\nCurrent Insurer: Other\n\nNot Currently Insured\n\n21st Century\n\nAAA Insurance\n\nAllstate\n\nEsurance\n\nFarmers Insurance\n\nGeico\n\nHartford Insurance\n\nLiberty Mutual\n\nNationwide\n\nProgressive\n\nState Farm\n\nTravelers Insurance\n\nMetLife\n\nSAFECO\n\nUSAA\n\nOther\n\nGood Credit\n\nCompare Rates\n\nUpdating...\n\nCompany\n\nInfo\n\nGet Quote\n\n  \n\nCompare Renters Insurance\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn Peklava LLC's site\n\nGet the Best Home Insurance Rates in California\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn DMS Insurance's site\n\nHome Insurance in Santa Clara, CA - Save $569/Year\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn QuotesMatch's site\n\nCheapest Home Insurance in Santa Clara, CA\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn AgileRates's site\n\nLowest Rates in CA\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn Blue Sky Coverage's site\n\nAffordable Home Insurance Quotes in CA\n\nSee Rates\n\nOn National Home Quotes's site\n\n## When you might need a public adjuster\n\nTypically when you file a property damage claim with your home insurance, your\ninsurance company will provide an insurance adjuster to review the damages to\nyour property, determine if your home insurance covers it and assign a\nvaluation to repairs. You do not need to pay for the insurance company\u2019s\nadjuster.\n\nWhile these individuals are qualified to perform their roles and you may have\nno issues, if your claim is denied or your payout is lower than you expected,\nyou may want to hire a public adjuster to get a second opinion. A public\nadjuster is paid by you and works for your interests.\n\nSome reasons to consider hiring a public adjuster may include:\n\n  * You want professional guidance to make sure you receive a large enough claim payout.\n  * You don\u2019t understand the claims process and want an experienced insurance expert to handle the process.\n  * Your insurer sent out an adjuster, but you\u2019re not sure they captured the full scope of damage in their report.\n  * You worry the payout offered by your insurer is too low and will not adequately cover all the expenses related to repair or replacement.\n\n## Where to get a public adjuster\n\nIf you find yourself in need of a public adjuster, you can reach out to the\nNational Association of Public Insurance Adjusters or the American Association\nof Public Insurance Adjusters and ask for a list of professionals in your\narea. Regional associations may also exist depending on where you live, so\nlook for those as well.\n\nYou can also ask friends and family if they have any recommendations. Before\ndeciding to work with any public adjuster, it\u2019s important to ask for\nreferences from former clients and to review their qualifications. You can\ncontact your state\u2019s insurance department to ensure a public adjuster is\nlicensed and to get a sample contract.\n\nMake sure you understand an adjuster\u2019s fees and qualifications before signing\na contract with one.\n\n## How much a public adjuster costs\n\nCosts vary among public adjusters, with most charging a percentage of your\nclaim payout. According to the Insurance Information Institute, public\nadjusters charge a fee of up to 15%.\n\nFor example, if you hire a public adjuster who charges 10% and you receive a\nclaim payout of $150,000, you will pay the adjuster $15,000.\n\nOther public adjusters may charge an hourly rate or use a flat fee structure.\nBe sure to factor in the cut of your payout to see if it makes sense with your\nbudget.\n\n\u201cWhen considering whether to engage a public adjuster, the insured should\nweigh the proposed fee or proposed percentage the insured will have to pay to\nthe public adjuster from any potential claim settlement,\u201d said Ricki\nGardenhire, information officer for the Kentucky Public Protection Cabinet.\n\n> **Tip:** If you hire a public adjuster and your insurance company does not\n> increase its offer, you still have to pay the adjuster.\n\n## How to choose a public adjuster\n\nTake your time when choosing a public adjuster as scams do exist. Consider\ninterviewing at least two public adjusters before making a decision and don\u2019t\nfeel pressured to sign a contract before reviewing all your options.\n\nFinding a public adjuster who maintains membership in a regional or national\nassociation for professional public adjusters is a good place to start, but\nyou should also check with your state\u2019s insurance board to verify their\nlicensure status.\n\nWhen natural disasters occur, some public adjusters will come from out of\nstate to find clients. When interviewing candidates, ask if their permanent\naddress is in your state of residence. Training and licensure requirements for\npublic adjusters vary across states.\n\nOther questions to ask include:\n\n  * How long they have worked as a public adjuster?\n  * Have any complaints been filed against them? \n  * Can they provide a list of local referrals you can contact?\n\nCarefully review the contract before signing with a public adjuster. Consider:\n\n  * Does the public adjuster charge a deposit?\n  * How much do they charge for their services?\n  * Are there any additional fees?\n  * Do they charge a penalty for canceling the contract? \n\nIf you can\u2019t find these details in the contract, ask for more information\nbefore signing.\n\n## Public adjuster vs. independent adjuster\n\nAs you research the process of hiring someone to help you manage the insurance\nclaims process, you may come across independent adjusters as well as public\nadjusters. Understanding the different types of insurance claims adjusters is\nimportant when navigating the claims process.\n\n**Independent adjusters work on behalf of insurance companies** in a\ncontractor position. They perform the same tasks as in-house adjusters and may\nwork for several insurance companies simultaneously.\n\n**Public adjusters work for you as the policyholder** to ensure you receive a\nfair and reasonable claim settlement.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nIs using a public adjuster a good idea?\n\nYou might consider hiring a public adjuster if you feel your home insurance\ncompany is not offering a reasonable payout. However, you should consider the\namount you will need to pay a public adjuster, which could be up to 15% of\nyour claim payout. If you sign a contract with a public adjuster, you will\nneed to pay them even if they are unable to get you a larger payout.\n\nWho pays the public adjuster?\n\nIf you hire a public adjuster, you will pay them. After receiving the claim\npayout from your insurer, you will pay the public adjuster the amount stated\nin your contract.\n\nSome public adjusters charge a percentage of the claim payout, while others\nmay use an hourly or flat fee pay structure. Make sure you understand the\nterms and conditions of payment before signing a contract.\n\nAre public adjuster fees tax deductible?\n\nIf you hire a public adjuster to handle a home insurance claim related to\npersonal property, such as damage to your house or belongings, their fees\ntypically cannot be deducted from your taxes.\n\nIs a public adjuster the same as an appraiser?\n\nNo. Appraisers complete their tasks before disaster strikes, determining the\ninsurable value of your home when you buy a policy. Public adjusters are\navailable to hire following a disaster, to ascertain the amount of damage done\nto your property and to advocate on your behalf for a fair claims payout from\nyour home insurance company.\n\nBlueprint is an independent publisher and comparison service, not an\ninvestment advisor.
