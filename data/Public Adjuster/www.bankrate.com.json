Your custom quotes are just minutes away.\n\nReturn to form\n\n## What is a public adjuster?\n\nWhen you file a claim, your homeowners insurance company will assign a claims\nadjuster to you. The adjuster\u2019s job is to evaluate your property damage and\ndetermine a fair payout amount based on the levels of coverage you carry on\nyour policy.\n\nRather than using the insurance company\u2019s adjuster, some policyholders choose\nto hire a public adjuster instead. Like a claims adjuster, a public adjuster\nwill assess the damage to your property, help determine the scope of repairs\nand estimate the replacement value for those repairs. The big difference is\nthat instead of working on behalf of the insurance company like an insurance\nclaims adjuster does, a public claims adjuster works for you.\n\nAfter your homeowners insurance company issues the settlement, the adjuster\nreceives a percentage of the payout amount as payment for their services. It\nis important to note that insurers do not consider the payment amount owed to\nthe adjuster when determining the claims payout amount. This payment would\ncome from the homeowner who hired the adjuster instead.\n\n## When should you hire a public adjuster?\n\nA public adjuster will handle your claim and communicate with your insurance\ncompany on your behalf. Some people feel that the extra expense of hiring a\npublic adjuster is worth it, if only for the peace of mind that they won\u2019t\nhave to handle the claims process themselves. Additionally, the public\nadjuster will look closely at your claim and help ensure that no damage is\noverlooked. Depending on what they find, you might get a larger insurance\nsettlement to repair the identified damage.\n\nA public adjuster might be right for you if:\n\n  * Your claim is large or damage is severe\n  * If you find working with insurance companies to be stressful\n  * If you\u2019ve had a poor claims experience in the past\n  * You are too busy to correspond with your insurance company\n  * If you feel that claim settlement is too low\n\n## How do you find a public adjuster?\n\nFinding a public insurance adjuster is relatively easy. Start by searching the\nNational Association of Public Insurance Adjusters (NAPIA) website. The NAPIA\nDirectory lists every public adjusting firm required to be licensed in their\nstate of operation. You can enter your city and state or ZIP code to see a\nlist of adjusters in your area.\n\nThe other way to find a public insurance adjuster is to get a recommendation\nfrom friends or family members. Ideally, you want to hire someone reputable\nand effective. Reading online customer reviews can also be helpful.\n\nOnce you find a few contenders, find out how much they charge. Most public\nadjusters keep a percentage of the final claim payout. It could be as little\nas 5 percent and as much as 20 percent. If you are facing a large claim with a\npotentially high payout, factor in the price before choosing to hire a public\nadjuster.\n\n## What should you expect from hiring a public adjuster?\n\nWhen you hire a public adjuster, they will handle the entire claim process on\nyour behalf. They will visit your home to survey the damage, do a\ncomprehensive review of your claim, calculate their recommended payout and\ncoordinate with your insurance company to process your payout.\n\nBefore settling the claim, you have the opportunity to negotiate with the\ninsurance company to get a higher payout. If you choose to do this, your\npublic adjuster will act as the liaison so you never have to speak with a\nrepresentative or negotiate yourself.\n\nAs mentioned, working with a public adjuster could lead to a higher payout. A\nreport from the Florida Association of Public Insurance Adjusters (FAPIA)\nreported that homeowners who hired their own insurance claims adjuster\nreceived a higher payout from their insurers. According to the study, the\ntypical settlement for homeowners with a public adjuster was about $22,266,\ncompared to $18,659 without a public adjuster.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that you will get more money by hiring a public\ninsurance adjuster. Your insurance company will consider the public adjuster\u2019s\nfindings, but they may not agree with their recommended payout.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n  *     *   \n\n###### When should I hire a public adjuster?\n\nCaret Down\n\nIt may seem counter-intuitive, but you will want to hire this person at the\nbeginning of the claim process. If your insurance company\u2019s adjuster provides\na recommended claim payout much lower than what you expect, you may want to\nhire a public adjuster. However, waiting until this stage of the process can\ndelay your claims handling process even further. If your property has\nsustained significant damage, it\u2019s best to hire a public adjuster early on.\n\n    *   \n\n###### Can I hire a contractor instead of a public adjuster?\n\nCaret Down\n\nIn short, no. A contractor and a public adjuster have separate\nresponsibilities. While a contractor is qualified to survey damage and\nestimate repair costs, they cannot handle insurance claims. A public adjuster\nmay consult a contractor for a second opinion, but generally a public adjuster\nis needed to navigate the insurance claim process.\n\n**SHARE:**\n\n  * Share this article on Facebook Facebook\n  * Share this article on Twitter Twitter\n  * Share this article on LinkedIn Linkedin\n  * Share this article via email Email\n\nWritten by ** Elizabeth RivelliArrow Right ** Contributor, Insurance\n\n  * Connect with Elizabeth Rivelli on LinkedIn Linkedin\n  * Get in contact with Elizabeth Rivelli via Email Email\n\nRead more from Elizabeth\n\nElizabeth Rivelli is a contributing insurance writer for Bankrate and has\nyears of experience writing for insurance domains such as The Simple Dollar,\nCoverage.com and NextAdvisor, among others\n\nEdited by **\n\nMaggie Kempken\n\nEdited by ** Maggie KempkenArrow Right ** Senior Editor, Insurance\n\nMaggie Kempken is an insurance editor for Bankrate.
