Use the Division's Title\nInsurance Rate Comparison Tool to view and compare custom title insurance and\nescrow rates.\n\nCLICK HERE  \n  \nWhen you take out a mortgage to buy a home, your lender is going to require\nyou to purchase title insurance in order to protect their interest. Title\ninsurance protects you and your lender financially from any unknown claims or\ndefects in the title of the property you are buying.\n\nThere are two types of title insurance policies: The owner\u2019s policy which\nprotects you for as long as you own the property and the lender\u2019s policy,\nwhich protects the lender until the loan is paid off. The lender only requires\nthe purchase of a lender\u2019s policy, but only the owner\u2019s policy will protect\nyour interests. In Nevada, the buyer will traditionally purchase the insurance\nfor the lender, and the seller will purchase the insurance for the buyer, but\nthis can be negotiated.\n\nThe cost of title insurance can vary significantly between companies. You do\nnot have to use the company recommended to you.\n\nThe Nevada Division of Insurance provides a guide to title insurance and a\nrate comparison tool to help you as you shop. Prices for both an owner\u2019s and\nlender\u2019s policy combined can range from $1,046 to $1,407 for $150,000 worth of\ncoverage in Clark County.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to shop around to find title insurance that fits\nyour needs and budget. Click here to search for and compare title insurance\nand escrow rates.\n\n## **How does title insurance work?**\n\nWhen you purchase title insurance, the agent or company will search public\nrecords to document the chain of ownership of a property. If any liens or\ndefects are found, the title company will either cure them before issuing a\ntitle policy, or exclude them from coverage.\n\nOnce the company believes that the property title is clean, they will issue\nyou and your lender title insurance policies. These insurance policies protect\nyou and your lender financially from any unknown claims or defects existing at\nthe time of purchase.\n\nFor more information about title insurance read the Nevada Consumer's Guide to\nTitle Insurance.\n\n## Filing a Complaint\n\nThose with questions or complaints about a title insurance company can file a\ncomplaint here.\n\n  * Consumers\n  * Health Insurance Rates\n  * Healthcare Reform\n  * Licensing\n  * News & Notices\n  * About Us\n  * Self-Insured\n  * Contact Us\n  * Careers\n\n  * \u00a92013 Nevada Division of Insurance\n  * Site Map\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Search\n\n"
