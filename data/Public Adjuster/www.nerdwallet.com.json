But filing a claim can be a grueling experience, with\nhours of painstaking paperwork \u2014 and if you make any omissions, you could get\na lower payout. That\u2019s where public insurance adjusters can help.\n\n## What is a public adjuster?\n\nA public adjuster is an insurance expert you can hire to manage your claim for\nyou. While insurance company adjusters represent the insurer\u2019s interests,\npublic insurance adjusters represent you. Their job is to get you every dollar\nyou\u2019re entitled to.\n\n## What does a public adjuster do?\n\nA public adjuster will inspect and assess the damage to your home and\ndetermine how much coverage you\u2019re eligible for under your policy. They\u2019ll\nalso estimate the cost of fixing the damage and document what you\u2019ve lost. An\nadjuster will communicate with the insurance company on your behalf to\nnegotiate a settlement.\n\nPublic adjusters generally work on large, complex claims. For example,\nrecovering after a hurricane can be especially challenging because it often\nmeans filing claims on different policies. If the wind ripped your roof off as\nfloodwaters rose, you\u2019d file a homeowners or windstorm insurance claim plus a\nflood insurance claim.\n\nYou could also face tricky questions like this: How much of the water damage\nwas due to rain coming in through the torn-up roof and how much was due to\nflooding? The water damage related to the roof would fall under a homeowners\nor windstorm policy. The flood damage would fall under a flood insurance\npolicy.\n\nA public adjuster can help you figure out the answers and get the most from\neach available policy.\n\n\u00bb MORE: How to get money if you don\u2019t have flood insurance\n\n## Pros and cons of hiring a public adjuster\n\nEnlisting the help of a public adjuster isn\u2019t the right choice for every\nclaim. Here are some pros and cons to consider.\n\n### Pros\n\nThey may be able to get you a larger settlement. The main advantage of hiring\na public adjuster is to have an experienced professional negotiating for the\nmost generous possible claims payout. They can help you document everything\nyou\u2019ve lost and spot potential damage the insurance company\u2019s adjuster might\nhave missed.\n\nThey can save you time. Filing a large insurance claim requires significant\ntime and energy, between filling out forms and communicating with the insurer.\nIf you already have a demanding full-time job, are busy caring for kids or\nsimply don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle, hiring a public adjuster may be\nwell worth the money.\n\nThey can guide you through the claims process. Insurance policies are full of\nlegalese and nitty-gritty details, which can be difficult for the average\nperson to understand. An experienced public adjuster can help you better\nunderstand your coverage and how the claims process works.\n\nThey can help you dispute a settlement. If you initially filed your own claim\nand are unhappy with your insurer\u2019s settlement offer, you can hire a public\nadjuster to review the case and negotiate for a higher payout.\n\n\u00bb MORE: 6 key terms to understand in your homeowners policy\n\n### Cons\n\nThey\u2019re not suitable for every claim. For small, straightforward claims, you\nmay be better off filing on your own and saving yourself the adjuster\u2019s fee.\n(Some adjusters won\u2019t even work on certain claims if the potential payoff is\ntoo low.)\n\nPayouts are constrained by your policy limits. The best public adjusters are\nknowledgeable and good at what they do, but they aren\u2019t miracle workers. A\npublic adjuster can\u2019t get you more money from the insurer than you\u2019re entitled\nto receive under the policy.\n\nSay your home burns down in a fire and all your belongings are destroyed. If\nit\u2019ll cost you $200,000 to replace everything, but your personal property\nlimit is only $150,000, a public adjuster probably can\u2019t get you that extra\n$50,000 in coverage.\n\nTheir fee will reduce your payout. Public adjusters usually charge anywhere\nfrom 5% to 20% of the total settlement. However, in some cases you\u2019ll pay a\nflat or hourly rate. Some states cap the fees, and they may be negotiable \u2014\nbut one way or another, you\u2019ll have to pay for the adjuster\u2019s time and\nexpertise.\n\nThey\u2019re not available in all states. There are certain parts of the U.S. where\npublic adjusters can\u2019t assist with home insurance claims. For example, public\nadjusters in Kansas can work only on commercial claims, while public adjusters\naren\u2019t permitted at all in Arkansas.\n\nThey\u2019re not all legitimate. Disasters bring out scam artists: unqualified\npeople who pose as public adjusters and take advantage of vulnerable people.\nFollow the tips below to avoid this type of scenario.\n\n\u00bb MORE: How to make a home inventory for insurance claims\n\n## How to find a good public adjuster\n\nNot all public adjusters are equally qualified and experienced, so it\u2019s\nimportant to do your research before hiring one. Follow these tips:\n\n  * Get referrals. You can find adjusters in your area through the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters.\n\n  * Check whether the adjuster is licensed in your state. Many state insurance departments, which regulate public insurance adjusters, let you verify licenses online. (Note that certain states, such as Alaska and Alabama, don\u2019t provide licenses for public adjusters.)\n\n  * Check if any complaints have been filed with the Better Business Bureau.\n\n  * Ask for references and check at least three if possible.\n\n  * Read the contract and understand the fees before hiring the adjuster.\n\n  * Stay away from anyone who comes to your door unsolicited, demands an upfront fee or pressures you to sign a contract.\n\n\u00bb MORE: How to make a storm damage insurance claim\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nAre public adjusters legitimate?\n\nA reputable public adjuster understands the insurance industry, is licensed in\ntheir state and can help you navigate the claims process.
