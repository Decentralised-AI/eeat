Transformation\n\n######\n\n## What Is Data Transformation?\n\nData transformation is the process of converting data from one format to\nanother. The most common data transformations are converting raw data into a\nclean and usable form, converting data types, removing duplicate data, and\nenriching the data to benefit an organization. During the process of data\ntransformation, an analyst will determine the structure, perform data mapping,\nextract the data from the original source, execute the transformation, and\nfinally store the data in an appropriate database.\n\nTransformed data is usable, accessible, and secure to benefit a variety of\npurposes. Organizations may transform data to make it compatible with other\ntypes of data, move it into the appropriate database, or combine it with other\ncrucial information. Organizations benefit from transforming data by gaining\ninsights into vital operational and informational internal and external\nfunctions. In addition, data transformation makes it possible for\norganizations to transform data from a storage database to the cloud to keep\ninformation moving.\n\n## Benefits and Challenges of Data Transformation\n\nBenefits:\n\n  * Data is easier to digest and manage: Refined metadata\n  * Improved data quality and protection\n  * Compatibility between applications and types of data\n  * Maximum value from data: standardize data to improve accessibility and usability.\n\nChallenges:\n\n  * Expensive process : cost of licensing, resources and hiring.\n  * Resource intensive: Can slow down other operations\n  * Needs expertise\n  * Businesses can perform unnecessary data transformation\n\n## Data Transformation Process\n\nData discovery: The first step involves identifying and understanding the data\nin its source format. This helps establish what the desired data format is and\nhow to achieve it.\n\nData mapping: In this phase, the actual transformation process is planned.\n\nGenerating Code: A code is created to run the actual transformation process.\nThese codes are often generated with a data transformation tool.\n\nExecuting the code. The panned data transformation process is put into motion\nusing the generated code. The data is converted to its desired format.\n\nReview. This is the process of checking if the transformed data has been\ncorrectly formatted.\n\n###  A Look at Data Transformation Tools\n\nThis data transformation process of converting sets of data values from a\nsource format to a format consistent for a destination data system often\nrequires tools. Data element to element mapping can be complicated and\nrequires complex transformations that require lots of rules, which is why\nsuccessful analysts use these tools to help simplify the process. This on-\ngoing process of shaping, standardizing and enriching data to conform to the\nright analytic outputs, has long been considered tedious, time-consuming,\n\u201cjanitorial\u201d work. Worse yet, when it comes to complex or large volumes of\ndata, the work is relegated to the small number of valuable resources with\nadvanced data science skills, regardless of whether they have the business\ncontext or not. In short, the data transformation process has historically\nbeen fraught with roadblocks and frustrations, often consuming way more time\nthan the actual analysis. Until recently there haven\u2019t been a lot of data\ntransformation tools available to help solve the challenges of IT\norganizations.\n\n### Predictive Data Transformation\n\nAt Alteryx our goal is to radically accelerate the process of transforming\ndata and reduce the time it takes to analyze information and get the most out\nof your data. We are focused on fundamentally changing the experience of\ntransforming data and providing delightful experiences with data. This means\nmore than transforming data. It means creating shareable, reusable processes\nto help technical and non-technical users get to know the shape and structure\nof their data. When done well, this process lays the foundation for successful\nand repeatable analyzes.\n\n**Alteryx Designer Cloud Data Transformation Tools**\n\nTo extend transformation capabilities to non-technical business users, the\nAlteryx Designer Cloud data wrangling experience includes predictive data\ntransformation. Users can click, drag or select over the specifics of the data\nthey would like to transform and, with every interaction, Designer Cloud\ngenerates a ranked list of suggested transformations for the user to evaluate\nor edit. This iterative feedback loop is always occurring throughout the use\nof Designer Cloud, constantly taking inputs from the data and the user to\nintelligently recommend new options.\n\n### A New Look at Data Transformation\n\nAs a key player in modern data transformation tools, Designer Cloud\u2019s\npredictive data transformation allows analysts to work more intelligently with\ntheir data without having to learn new skills. By using Designer Cloud the\ntransforming of data is not only easier, but faster and more fun, too.\n\nTry a new way to transform your data, try out Designer Cloud today.\n\n##### Next Term\n\nData Pipeline\n\n##### Related Resources\n\n\n\n###### Customer Story\n\n##### Saving Over 75 Hours Day with Automated Forecasting\n\nFinancial services company, Brookson gave their customers better digital\nexperiences by elevating and scaling their internal team.\n\n  * Data Prep and Analytics\n  * Data Science and Machine Learning\n  * Process Automation\n\nRead Now\n\n\n\n###### Customer Story\n\n##### Nippon Caterpillar Japan Streamlines Analysis Operations\n\nLearn how Nippon Caterpillar Japan transformed their data to accelerate\noperational efficiencies.\n\n  * Data Prep and Analytics\n  * Marketing\n  * Asia Pacific\n\nRead Now\n\n## Transform Your Analytics\n\nGet ready to unlock hidden insights in your data\n\nStart Free Trial\n\nAlteryx provides the leading Analytics Cloud Platform.
