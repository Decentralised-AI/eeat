We tested every single one. **We looked at features, pricing, and we\npicked Rivery.** Over the years, we\u2019ve redone that shopping and confirmed our\nchoice \u2013 **Rivery is exactly what we want.\u201d**\n\nDaniel Rimon\n\nDirector of Data Engineering\n\n\u201cWith a simple onboarding, you can save your business money in terms of\ndevelopment, maintenance & monitoring resources and get your data in a smooth\nand reliable way.\u201d\n\n### Rivery Pricing FAQs\n\nWhat is a RPU credit?\n\nRPU credit = Rivery Pricing Unit credit:\n\n  * Database, file storage and webhook sources are charged only on the amount of data transferred down to the byte.\n  * Most application (API) based sources are charged for each execution of a data pipeline.\n  * Applications (APIs) with high-frequency replications can be charged on the amount of data transferred similar to databases.\n\nWe charge you based on actual usage, not number of rows, allowing you to scale\nin a flexible and transparent way.\n\nWhy are Database and file storage sources priced differently than API sources?\n\nData replication from database and file sources consume less compute time and\ntherefore costs less for Rivery, so we\u2019re passing these savings onto our\ncustomers.\n\nCan I estimate costs based on number of rows?\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how many GB per month you\u2019ll need, and want an estimate\nbased on the number of rows, we usually use 1,000,000 rows = 87.4 MB of data\nas a **very rough** estimate. This means 1 GB = about 11.4 million rows.\n\nPlease note: For database replication, Rivery charges based only on the amount\nof data transferred, regardless of the number of rows. This means transferring\n2,000 rows of 60 bytes each, costs exactly the same as 12,000 rows of 10 bytes\neach (120,000 bytes).\n\nHow is RPU credit usage calculated?\n\nCredit usage is based on data source and pipeline type:\n\n **Data Source/Pipeline Type**|  **Credit Usage**  \n---|---  \n **Application (API) Based Sources  **| You\u2019re charged 1 credit every time you\ningest data from a single endpoint.  \n **Database Replication**\n\n **File Storage Sources**\n\n|  You\u2019re charged 1 credit per 100MB of data transferred (pro-rata),\nregardless of execution frequency.  \n **Orchestration & Advanced Workflows** (Logic and Transformations)| You\u2019re\ncharged 1 credit for every execution of an entire workflow.  \n  \nHere are some examples:\n\n **Scenario**|  **Credit Usage**  \n---|---  \nIngesting deal information from your CRM once every 24 hours.| 1 credit a day  \nIngesting both deal info & contact data (which have different endpoints) from\nyour CRM every 8 hours, but just Mon-Fri.| 30 credits a week  \n2 endpoints * 3 times a day * 5 times a week = 30  \nRunning an orchestration workflow that pulls data from 5 different API\nsources, once day.| 6 credits a day  \n5 API pulls + 1 advanced workflow = 6  \nYou transfer 1,725MB of data per month between your Postgres database and your\ndata warehouse.| 17.25 credits  \n1,725MB / 100MB = 17.25  \nYou transfer 280MB of data per month from files on SFTP servers to your data\nwarehouse.| 2.8 credits  \n280MB / 100MB = 2.8  \n  \n _Please note:_\n\n  * Simple \u201csource to target\u201d pipelines do not require setting up a workflow to execute.\n  * For application (API) based sources, pipelines that transfer more than 100MB of data per execution, one credit will be charged per 100MB of data. If no data is detected in the execution, the charge will be 0.5 credit.\n\n **Python**\n\nPython pricing is based on script execution time, server instance size, and\nnetwork bandwidth.\n\nFor complete Python details and Python examples, please see our **Python\ndocumentation** for more.\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the Free Trial?\n\nRivery\u2019s free trial includes access to all of the professional plan features,\nfor 14 days or 1,000 free credits (worth $1,200) of usage, whichever expires\nfirst.\n\nWhen your trial period ends, you can continue using Rivery by registering for\nany on-demand plan, or by **contacting us** to explore our annual and\nEnterprise plans.\n\nDoes Rivery charge per Connector?\n\nNo, Rivery does not charge per connector and there is no minimum or maximum on\nthe number of connectors you can use. We believe in providing you with the\nbest single source to efficiently align your data from internal databases and\nthird-party platforms.\n\nDoes Rivery charge per User?\n\nNo, Rivery does not charge per user.  \nThe Starter plan is limited to 2 users.  \nThe Professional and Enterprise plans includes unlimited users.\n\nDoes Rivery charge per Environment?\n\nNo, Rivery does not charge per environment.  \nThe Starter plan is limited to 1 environment  \nThe Professional plan is limited to 3 environments.  \nThe Enterprise plan includes unlimited environments.\n\nIs there a minimum number of API integrations required?\n\nNo, there is no minimum on the number of API integrations required for an\naccount.\n\nIs every data source available on every plan?\n\nYes \u2013 every data source we offer is available on all plans.\n\nCan Rivery connect to custom sources?\n\nYes! You have multiple options for connecting to practically any source, in\naddition to Rivery\u2019s managed sources.
