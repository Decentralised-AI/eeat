What are the benefits of data transformation?\nWhat are the processes? Learn all this and more!\n\n  * \n\n#### Matt Palmer\n\nOct 1, 2022 \u2022 8 min read\n\nThe last few decades have seen a renaissance in data collection and\nprocessing\u2014 today\u2019s data teams have more information at their disposal than\never before. While this has led to a proliferation of data analytics &\nscience, it\u2019s presented a number of problems for engineers and business teams.\n\nRaw data can be challenging to work with and difficult to filter. Often, the\nproblem isn\u2019t how to collect _more_ data, but which data to store and analyze.\nTo curate appropriate, meaningful data and make it usable across multiple\nsystems, businesses must leverage **data transformation.**\n\n##  **What is Data Transformation?**\n\nData transformation is the mutation of data characteristics to improve access\nor storage. Transformation may occur on the format, structure, or values of\ndata. With regard to data analytics, transformation usually occurs after data\nis _extracted_ or _loaded_ (E **T** L/EL **T** ).\n\nData transformation increases the efficiency of analytic processes and enables\ndata-driven decisions. Raw data is often difficult to analyze and too vast in\nquantity to derive meaningful insight, hence the need for clean, usable data.\n\nDuring the transformation process, an analyst or engineer will determine the\ndata structure. The most common types of data transformation are:\n\n  *  **Constructive:** The data transformation process adds, copies, or replicates data.\n  *  **Destructive:** The system deletes fields or records.\n  *  **Aesthetic:** The transformation standardizes the data to meet requirements or parameters.\n  *  **Structural:** The database is reorganized by renaming, moving, or combining columns.\n\nIn addition, a practitioner might also perform **data mapping** and store data\nwithin the ******appropriate database technology**.\n\nWhat is Data Preparation? | Zuar\n\nThis article discusses what data preparation entails and how it is done.\n\nZuar | BlogTeam Zuar\n\n##  **The Data Transformation Process**\n\nIn a cloud data warehouse, the data transformation process most typically\ntakes the form of ELT (Extract Load Transform) or ETL (Extract Transform\nLoad). With cloud storage costs becoming cheaper by the year, many teams opt\nfor ELT\u2014 the difference being that _all_ data is loaded in cloud storage,\n_then_ transformed and added to a warehouse.\n\nThe transformation process generally follows 6 stages:\n\n  1.  **Data Discovery:** During the first stage, data teams work to understand and identify applicable raw data. By _profiling_ data, analysts/engineers can better understand the transformations that need to occur.\n  2.  **Data Mapping:** During this phase, analysts determine how individual fields are modified, matched, filtered, joined, and aggregated.\n  3.  **Data Extraction:** During this phase, data is moved from a source system to a target system. Extraction may include structured (databases) _or_ unstructured (event streaming, log files) sources.\n  4.  **Code Generation and Execution:** Once extracted and loaded, transformation needs to occur on the raw data to store it in a format appropriate for BI and analytic use. This is frequently accomplished by analytics engineers, who write SQL/Python to programmatically transform data. This code is executed daily/hourly to provide timely and appropriate analytic data.\n  5.  **Review:** Once implemented, code needs to be reviewed and checked to ensure a correct and appropriate implementation.\n  6.  **Sending:** The final step involves sending data to its target destination. The target might be a data warehouse or other database in a structured format.\n\nThese steps are meant to illustrate patterns of data transformation\u2014 no single\n\u201ccorrect\u201d transformation process exists. The right process is the one that\nworks for your data team. That is to say, other bespoke operations might occur\nin a transformation.\n\nFor example, analysts may filter data by loading certain columns.\nAlternatively, they might enrich the data with names, geo-properties, etc. or\ndedupe and join data from multiple sources.\n\n _ **Want to automate your ETL processes to enable all of your data to flow\ninto a single destination? Learn more about Zuar\u2019sRunner platform that allows\nyou to transform, model, report, and manage your data more effectively.**_\n\n##  **Data Transformation Types**\n\nThere are two common approaches to data transformation in the cloud:\nscripting-/code-based tools and low-/no-code tools. Scripting tools are the\nde-facto standard, with the greatest amount of customization, flexibility, and\ncontrol over how data is transformed. Nonetheless, low-code solutions have\ncome a long way, specifically in the last few years. We\u2019ll briefly discuss\nboth options.\n\n###  **Scripting Tools**\n\nThe most common data transformations occur using SQL or Python. At the\nsimplest, these transformations might be stored in a repository and executed\nusing some orchestrator. More commonly, platforms like dbt are used to\norchestrate and order transformations using a combination of SQL/Python. These\ntools or systems often boil down to programmatically creating tables or\ntransformations using some scripting language.\n\nThe Python Runner SDK is also useful for scripting and automation. Enabling\nremote interactions with schedules, jobs, and business functions has never\nbeen easier. Want to see Runner in action? Schedule a demo of the Python\nRunner SDK.\n\n###  **Low-/No-Code Tools**\n\nThese data transformation tools are the easiest for non-technical users to\nutilize. They allow you to collect data from any cloud source and load it into\nyour data warehouse using an interactive GUI. Over the past decade, many low-\ncode solutions have proliferated.\n\nZuar Runner is an example of a product that has ETL/ELT capabilities, but also\nhelps you manage data at every step in its journey. Runner can be hosted\neither on-premise or in the cloud and has code and no code options.\n\nData Cleaning: Benefits, Steps & Using Clean Data | Zuar\n\nThis article discusses data cleaning, its benefits, and how to create and use\nclean data.\n\nZuar | BlogTeam Zuar\n\n##  **Data Transformation Techniques**\n\nThere are several data transformation techniques that can help structure and\nclean up the data before analysis or storage in a data warehouse. Here are\nsome of the more common methods:\n\n  *  **Smoothing:** This is the data transformation process of removing distorted or meaningless data from the dataset. It also detects minor modifications to the data to identify specific patterns or trends.\n  *  **Aggregation:** Data aggregation collects raw data from multiple sources and stores it in a single format for accurate analysis and reports. This technique is necessary when your business collects high volumes of data.\n  *  **Discretization:** This data transformation technique creates interval labels in continuous data to improve efficiency and easier analysis. The process utilizes decision tree algorithms to transform a large dataset into compact categorical data.\n  *  **Generalization:** Utilizing concept hierarchies, generalization converts low-level attributes to high-level, creating a clear data snapshot.\n  *  **Attribute Construction:** This technique allows a dataset to be organized by creating new attributes from an existing set.\n  *  **Normalization:** Normalization transforms the data so that the attributes stay within a specified range for more efficient extraction and data mining applications.\n  *  **Manipulation:** Manipulation is the process of changing or altering data to make it more readable and organized. Data manipulation tools help identify patterns in the data and transform it into a usable form to generate insight.\n\n##  **Data Transformation: Benefits**\n\nTransforming data can help businesses in a variety of ways. Here are some of\nthe biggest benefits:\n\n  *  **Better Organization:** Transformed data is easier for both humans and computers to use. The process of transformation involves assessing and altering data to optimize storage and discoverability.\n  *  **Improved Data Quality:** Bad data poses a number of risks. Data transformation can help your organization eliminate quality issues and reduce the possibility of misinterpretation.\n  *  **Faster Queries:** By standardizing data and storing it properly in a warehouse, query speed and BI tooling can be optimized\u2014 resulting in lower friction to analysis.\n  *  **Simpler Data Management:** A large part of data transformation is metadata and lineage tracking. By implementing these techniques, teams can drastically simplify data management. This is especially important as organizations grow and demand data from a large number of sources.\n  *  **Broader Use:** Transformation makes it easier to get the most out of your data by standardizing and making it more usable.\n\nWhile the methods of data transformation come with numerous benefits, it\u2019s\nimportant to understand that a few potential drawbacks exist.\n\n  *  **Transformation can beexpensive and resource-intensive:** While processing and compute costs have fallen in recent years, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear stories of extreme AWS, GCP, or Databricks bills. Furthermore, the resource cost from a man-hour/salary perspective is hefty: most companies require a team of data analysts/engineers/scientists to extract value from data.\n  *  ** ** **Contextual awareness is crucial:****** If analysts/engineers transforming data lack business context or understanding, extreme errors are possible. While data observability tooling continues to improve, there are some errors that are almost undetectable and could lead to misinterpreting data or making an incorrect business decision.\n\nNonetheless, data transformation is an essential part of any data driven\norganization. Implementing tests and following the best-practices of software\ndevelopment will help to minimize errors and improve confidence in data.\nWithout experienced data analysts with the right subject matter expertise,\nproblems may occur during the data transformation process. While the benefits\nof data transformation outweigh the drawbacks, it's necessary to take\nappropriate caution to ensure sound transformation.\n\n##  **Data Transformation Implementation**\n\nOrganizing, transforming, and structuring data can be an overwhelming task for\nmany organizations, but with the right research and planning it's possible to\nintegrate a data-driven culture into your business. But first, it\u2019s crucial to\nhave a long-term strategy for analysis and transformation.\n\nZuar offers several products (e.g. our data pipeline tool Zuar Runner) and\nservices that can enable more efficient and accurate data management, by\nautomating many steps in the process!\n\n###  **Next Steps: Learn about...**\n\n  *  **Zuar's Products**\n  *  **Zuar\u2019s Services**\n  *  **Schedule a Free Data Strategy Assessment**\n\nWhat is Data Integration? | Zuar\n\nData integration systems bundle together your data from all of your different\nprograms into cohesive information that helps your business intelligence.\n\nZuar | BlogTeam Zuar\n\nEverything You Need To Know About Data Mapping | Zuar\n\nEmploy data mapping to combine/migrate all of your desperate data into a\nsingle destination.
