It is an imperative step in feature engineering that\nfacilitates discovering insights. This article will cover techniques of\nnumeric data transformation: log transformation, clipping methods, and data\nscaling.\n\n **Why need data transformation?**\n\n  * the algorithm is more likely to be biased when the data distribution is skewed\n  * transforming data into the same scale allows the algorithm to compare the relative relationship between data points better\n\n **When to apply data transformation**\n\nWhen implementing supervised algorithms, training data and testing data need\nto be transformed in the same way. This is usually achieved by feeding the\ntraining dataset to building the data transformation algorithm and then apply\nthat algorithm to the test set.\n\n# Basic Feature Engineering and EDA\n\nFor this exercise, I am using the Marketing Analytics dataset from Kaggle.\n\nIf you would like to access the full code, please visit my website.\n\nFirstly I performed some basic feature engineering to make data tidier and\nmore insightful.\n\n    \n    \n    # 1. Transform Year_Birth into Age  \n    from datetime import date  \n    df['Age'] = date.today().year - df['Year_Birth']# 2. Transform Dt_Customer into Enrollment_Length  \n    df['Year'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['Dt_Customer']). year  \n    df['Enrollment_Length'] = date.today().year - df['Year']# 3. Transform Currency format into numbers  \n    df['Income$'] = df[' Income '].str.replace(',', '').str.replace('$', '').str.replace('.', '').fillna(0).astype(int)  \n    df['Income_M$'] = df['Income$'].apply(lambda x: round(x/1000000, 2))  \n    print(df[['Income_M$', 'Income$']])\n\n **1.Transform year of birth to \u201cAge\u201d**\n\nSubtract current year from Year_Birth.\n\n **2\\. Transform the date customer enrolled (\u201cDt_Customer\u201d) into\n\u201cEnrollment_Length\u201d**\n\n\\--\n\n\\--\n\n2\n\nFollow\n\n## Written by Destin Gong\n\n2.8K Followers\n\n\u00b7Writer for\n\nTowards Data Science\n\nOn my way to become a data storyteller | Website: www.visual-design.net\n\nFollow\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\nTeams\n\n",
