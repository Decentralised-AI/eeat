Aggregating and structuring data coming\nfrom different sources has become a much less laborious job thanks to the ETL\ndata transformation process.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll tell you all you need to know about ETL \u2014 what it contains, what\ntypes of data transformation exist, and how to choose the right data\ntransformation tool.  \n\n\nNikola Gemes\n\nFeb 14 2023 \u25cf 6 min read\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n  * What is the ETL data transformation process? \n  * Extraction \n  * Transformation\n  * Loading\n  * ETL vs. ELT\n  * 10 common types of data transformation\n  * Choose the right data transformation type in 3 steps\n  * Let\u2019s get that data prepared\n\n## What is the ETL data transformation process?\n\nThe data transformation process is part of an ETL process (extract, transform,\nload) that prepares data for analysis. This includes cleaning the data, such\nas removing duplicates, filling in NULL values, and reshaping and computing\nnew dimensions and metrics.\n\nIn a typical ETL workflow, data transformation is the stage that follows data\nextraction \u2014 a process where raw data is extracted from various data sources\nto the staging area.\n\nAfter data is transformed, it is loaded into its data store. This can be a\ntarget database, data warehouse, data lake, or even multiple destinations.\n\nCleaned data is often loaded into business intelligence (BI) tools for\nvisualization and analysis by users who don\u2019t need any tech skills.\n\nThe transformed data can also be used as a source for machine learning\nworkflows or other data analytics uses.  \n\nWhen designing Whatagraph, we wanted to achieve two things:\n\n  * Offer a hassle data transfer service\n  * Provide effortless reporting on stored data\n\nWe simplified both processes to the point-and-click level so anyone can\ncomplete them.\n\nWhatagraph not only saves the time needed to load data from multiple sources\nto Google BigQuery, but also allows you to generate beautiful interactive\nreports with only a few clicks.  \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an easy-to-use solution to connect data from various\nmarketing sources, keep your marketing data safe, or want to visualize your\nBigQuery data, book a demo call and find out how Whatagraph can help.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s explain how the ETL process works.\n\n### Extraction\n\nBefore data can be moved to a new destination, it must be extracted from\nvarious sources and data analysis tools. In the first step of the ETL process,\nstructured and unstructured data is consolidated into a single data\nrepository. Data sets can be extracted from a range of sources, including the\nfollowing:  \n\n\n  * Existing databases and legacy systems\n  * Cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments\n  * Sales and marketing apps\n  * Mobile apps\n  * CRM systems\n  * Relational databases\n\nThis stage was traditionally performed manually by data engineers and was\ntime-intensive and prone to errors. ETL tools now automate the entire process,\ngiving way to more reliable data management.\n\n### Transformation\n\nIn this stage of the ETL process, data is subjected to a matrix of rules and\nregulations that ensure data quality and accessibility. The data\ntransformation process consists of several sub-processes like cleansing and\ndeduplication, which we\u2019ll cover in more detail below.  \n\n\nTransformation is probably the most important part of the ETL process. It\nimproves data integrity, removes duplicates, and standardizes the data so it\narrives at its new destination fully compatible and ready to use.\n\n### Loading\n\nThe final step in the ETL process is to load the newly transformed data into a\nnew destination, for example, a cloud-based data warehouse like Google\nBigQuery, Snowflake, or Amazon Redshift.  \n\nData can be loaded to a data warehouse at once \u2014 full load or at scheduled\nintervals incremental load.\n\nYou can make the load process smoother and more efficient by using a data\npipeline. In these systems, different datasets can be extracted, transformed,\nand loaded at the same time.\n\nFor example, an incoming data set is transformed, and during that time, new\ndata is extracted. As the transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse,\nthe extracted data is transformed in real-time.\n\nWhatagraph is an automated data pipeline that helps business users load data\nfrom multiple marketing data sources to BigQuery.\n\nOur data transfer service eliminates much of the manual work, allowing you to\ncomplete the data transfer in just four steps:\n\n  1. Connect the destination\n  2. Choose the integration\n  3. Set the schema\n  4. Schedule the transfer\n\nIn the last stage, you can also set the schedule \u2014 when and how often you want\nyour data to move to BigQuery.\n\nWhatagraph is a tool that grows with your business needs.\n\nFor the moment, you might be content with insights you draw from your\nInstagram business account or Twitter Ads, but when you need more connectors,\nWhatagraph scales up to deliver.\n\nWhen you need a report on your BigQuery data, Whatagraph helps you create\ndrag-and-drop dashboards that you can fully customize with different graphs,\ntables, and color schemes.\n\n## ETL vs. ELT\n\nAs we\u2019ve just seen ETL tools extract and transform large volumes of data from\ndifferent sources before loading it into a data warehouse.\n\nHowever, with the advent of powerful cloud data warehouses, there\u2019s less need\nfor data cleanup before loading it.\n\nThe cloud has enabled an ETL architecture that has two steps different from\nthe ETL pipeline.\n\n  *  **Extract** : Extract data from multiple sources and connectors. \n  *  **Load** : Load data into the data warehouse.\n  *  **Transform** : Transform it using the power and scalability of the target cloud platform as needed. \n\nIn ELT pipelines, raw data is extracted from the source system and loaded into\nthe warehouse. Data loading takes place before transformation, which speeds up\nthe process.\n\nHowever, both architectures have their advantages and disadvantages, but\ngenerally:\n\n  *  **ETL** is better suited for smaller data pipelines when you need structured data that is suitable for analysis and visualization.  \n\n\n  *  **ELT** is better suited for big data operations where data scientists need to access raw data and prepare it for further assessment. \n\n## 10 common types of data transformation\n\nThere are many ways to cleanse source data before you can load it into a data\nwarehouse. These are the ones most commonly used.\n\n **1\\. Data filtering** : The simplest of all transformations. This process\nfilters rows and columns before saving or inserting data into the data\nstorage.\n\n **2.** **Data mapping**: Another common type of data transformation that\ntakes one data input and changes it to its equivalent in a unified format. It\ncan unify capitalizations, convert strings to the same encoding standards,\nsync date, and time values, etc.\n\nSource\n\n **3\\. Data deduplication** : Deduplication is a data processing step that\nremoves duplicate data before inserting it into the data warehouse.\n\n **4\\. Derived variables** : Derived variables compute attributes from other\ndata points and variables. For example, a column may compute entries from\nother rows and columns.\n\n **5\\. Data sorting** : Before loading data, you can sort it by date or other\ncriteria, so it\u2019s easier to find via search.\n\n **6\\. Data joining** : This step merges related data elements that are\ncollected from multiple data sources. For example, you can join spend data\nfrom Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Ads into a single table.\nWhatagraph allows you to instantly pull data from most popular marketing data\nsources using pre-built connectors.\n\n **7\\. Data aggregating** : Aggregation picks a relevant dimension and groups\nmetrics across that dimension. For example, it can compute the total number of\nnew customers (group metrics) on each date (dimension).\n\nSource\n\n **8\\. Data splitting** : When working with unstructured and semi-structured\ntarget data like strings, JSON, XML, or flat files, you need to split the data\nbefore saving it into a table. For example, when you get a customer address in\nthe form of a string, before you save it into the customer table, you split it\ninto columns for the street, city, zip code, etc.\n\n **9\\. Data validation** : They can be either simple or complex. For example,\nif the first three columns in a row are empty, you can reject the row from\nprocessing.\n\n **10\\. Data integration** : This step gives each unique data element one\nstandard name with a standard definition. Integrating data from different\nsystems allow teams to access and use it.  \n\n\n## Choose the right data transformation type in 3 steps\n\nThe choice of transformation type depends on your business rules and needs.\n\nHere are three steps to get you on the right track:\n\n **1\\. Identify the target tables schema**\n\nGet a list of tables and their schemas (columns, possible values, etc) of how\nthe data would ideally look once it\u2019s cleaned and loaded into the data\nwarehouse.\n\n **2\\. Record the gap between target and incoming data**\n\nCompare and contrast the ideal target state with the raw data you collected in\nthe extraction step. Try to spot out what transformation types you\u2019d need to\nconvert the raw data into the structured data.\n\n **3\\. Implement the changes**\n\nValidate the transformations before putting them on autopilot with your ETL\ntool of choice.\n\n## Let\u2019s get that data prepared\n\nThe ETL process is an essential part of data warehousing, and the \u201cT\u201d for\n\u201ctransformation\u201d in its name is by all means the most important step.\n\nBut with huge amounts of data pouring in from all sides, you need a tool that\nwill load this data to a data warehouse quickly and effortlessly.\n\nBut why stop there? Why not automate the whole process?\n\nWhatagraph allows you to set up data transfers to BigQuery in just three steps\nand then schedule the task so you can write it off your list.\n\nPublished on Feb 14 2023\n\nWRITTEN BY\n\nNikola Gemes\n\nNikola is a content marketer at Whatagraph with extensive writing experience\nin SaaS and tech niches.
