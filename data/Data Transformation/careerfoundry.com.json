Sometimes the data sources are\nstored in different formats or technologies. For example, the company I work\nfor uses both SQL and NoSQL solutions making it difficult to join the raw data\ntogether.\n\nUsing data transformation techniques, it\u2019s possible to bring the data out of\ntheir silos, reformat them and store them in a central location called a data\nwarehouse.\n\nIn this data transformation tutorial, we will simulate working with SQL and\nNoSQL data by walking through the steps of transforming JSON data into tabular\ndata in SQL Server. By the end of this article you\u2019ll have learned the\nfollowing about data transformation:\n\n  1. **What is data transformation?**\n  2. **How does data transformation work?**\n  3. **How to perform a data transformation**\n  4. **The benefits of data transformation**\n  5. **The challenges of data transformation**\n  6. **Summary**\n\nFeel free to use the clickable menu to skip ahead to any section. With that\nsaid, let\u2019s get started!\n\n## 1\\. What is data transformation?\n\nAt a high level, data transformation is the operations by which source data\nare formatted or reshaped to fit the constraints of downstream systems or\nprocesses. Data transformation is often considered a data engineering or data\ngovernance task, typically occurring in extract, transform, load or extract,\nload, transform (ETL/ELT) pipelines designed to process raw data.\n\nThese data transformation processes take extracted source data and add to it,\ndelete from it, or format it before storing it. In large scale systems, data\ntransformation is usually automated by software used for creating data\nwarehouses and data lakes. However, on smaller scales, data analysts and data\nscientists oftentimes will need to perform data transformations manually so\nthey can model the data to assist with data-driven decision making.\n\nAn explosion in the Internet of Things (IoT) or \u201csmart\u201d devices has resulted\nin an age of big data. The massive increase in data means it is more important\nthan ever to efficiently process and store data in ways that make it easy to\nanalyze. By creating pipelines and processes to transform their data,\norganizations ensure they\u2019re able to extract insights.\n\nTo help illustrate data transformation in the ETL/ELT processes, we\u2019re going\nto work through an example. Imagine you\u2019re an analyst at a company that stores\nstructured data via rows and columns in one database and unstructured data via\nJSON in another database.\n\nIn order to perform an analysis, you need to format the unstructured data so\nit can be joined with the structured data. Whether your process is based\naround ETL or ELT concepts, the transformation needs to take place so the raw,\nunstructured data ends up being compatible with the structured data.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at how data transformation works.\n\n## 2\\. How does data transformation work?\n\nData transformation is a process that involves understanding the data, mapping\nthe data to a destination system, and running the processes to perform the\ntransformation. Before performing data transformation,  pre-processing the\ndata might be required. Preprocessing data includes tasks like de-duplicating\nrecords, managing outliers, and imputing missing values. Preprocessing\nfunctions can be included in a data transformation pipeline.\n\n### The data transformation process\n\nTo better understand how data transformation works, let\u2019s review the data\ntransformation process by breaking it down into four steps:\n\n  1. **Discovering**\n  2. **Planning**\n  3. **Performing  **\n  4. **Reviewing  **\n\nWe\u2019ll go over each step in more detail now.\n\n### 1\\. Discovering variables in the source data\n\nThrough data discovery, you need to identify variables of interest within the\nsource data and figure out what pre-processing actions need to be performed to\nfacilitate the data transformation.\n\n### 2\\. Planning the data transformation\n\nTo map the source data to its landing system, you need to determine the\nstructure it needs to be in. In our example, we\u2019ll convert our JSON data to a\ntabular format of rows and columns. In addition to structure, in this step\nyou\u2019ll decide whether fields need to be renamed, dropped, or aggregated.\n\n### 3\\. Performing the data transformation\n\nSeveral tools or programming languages can be used to perform the data\ntransformation. For example, Microsoft Excel remains one of the most popular\ntools in data analytics and has several functions and features that can\ntransform data within the spreadsheet. When working with big data, Python and\nSQL are popular programming languages for data transformation. In our example,\nwe\u2019ll use SQL.\n\n **Related watching:** What are the key languages data analysts use?\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\n\n### 4\\. Reviewing the data transformation\n\nOnce the data transformation has occurred, evaluate it to make sure the\nresults are as expected. For example, use tools to count records or verify\nduplicates have been removed, or that data aggregations have been performed\ncorrectly.\n\nNow that you know all of the steps involved in data transformation, let\u2019s get\non with a short tutorial!\n\n## 3\\. How to perform a data transformation: An example using SQL\n\nNow that we\u2019ve reviewed how to transform data using the 4-step process, let\u2019s\napply the steps using real data, transforming JSON data into tabular data\nusing SQL. Databases relying on SQL have remained some of the most important\ntools for data management over the last 40 years, so understanding SQL is very\nimportant in the field of data analytics.\n\nIn this example, I\u2019ll be using Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Management\nStudio. Both can be downloaded for free. If you\u2019re new to SQL, check out this\nbeginner tutorial .\n\n### Step 1: Create the source JSON data\n\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is one of the most popular data interchange\nformats, so there is a good chance you\u2019ll encounter it when working with data\nand APIs. The JSON format supports hierarchical data structures, making use of\nobjects and arrays. An object is a key/value pair contained within curly\nbrackets {}. For example:\n\n _{\u201ckey1\u201d : \u201cvalue1\u201d, \u201ckey2\u201d:\u201dvalue2\u2033}_\n\nAn array is a list of values contained within brackets []:\n\n _[\u201cvalue1\u201d, \u201cvalue2\u201d, \u201cvalue3\u201d]_\n\nTo keep things simple, we\u2019ll save some JSON data within the same database as\nour destination table. In the real world, the JSON data could be in a\ndifferent database or streaming from a completely different system.\n\nCreate a database named **dataTransformation** using the following code:\n\n    \n    \n    create database dataTransformation\n\nCreate a new table that stores the source JSON data named **sourceJSONTable**.\n\n    \n    \n    use dataTransformation\n    create table sourceJSONTable (\n     [jsonID] [int] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,\n     [jsonData] nvarchar(MAX) NOT NULL,\n    ) ON [PRIMARY]\n\nThen, populate **sourceJSONTable** using the following INSERT script:\n\n    \n    \n    insert into sourceJSONTable(jsonData)\n    select '{\n    \t\t\"country\":\"United States\",\n    \t\t\"states\":[\"California\", \"Minnesota\", \"Washington\"],\n    \t\t\"cities\":[\n    \t\t\t{\"CA\":\"San Diego\"},\n    \t\t\t{\"MN\":\"Minneapolis\"},\n    \t\t\t{\"WA\":\"Seattle\"}\n    \t\t  ]\n    \t}'\n\nNext, you\u2019ll verify the JSON data has been inserted into the sourceJSONTable.\n\n### Step 2. Create the destination table\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got JSON data in sourceJSONTable, let\u2019s create our destination\ntable. After creating the table, we\u2019ll go through the four steps for how to\ntransform data (discovering, planning, performing, reviewing).\n\nCreate the destination table using the following INSERT script:\n\n    \n    \n    use dataTransformation\n    create table destinationTable  (\n    [tableID] [int] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,\n    [country] nvarchar(50),\n    [state] nvarchar(50),\n    [abbreviation] varchar(3),\n    [city] nvarchar(50)\n    )\n\n### Step 3. Discover data\n\nIn the first step of data transformation, we inspect our source data to\nidentify the variables of interest. Comparing the source data to the\ndestination table, we see our variables of interest are _country_ , _state_ ,\n_abbreviation_ , and _city_. Looking at the JSON data, we can see our\nvariables of interest are stored in key:value pairs, along with a nested JSON\narray.\n\n### Step 4. Plan data transformation\n\nIn the discovery step we identified our variables of interest, now let\u2019s put\ntogether a plan to transform the data. We need to pull out each object in the\nJSON and insert it into a separate column in the destination table.\n\nThis is a data transformation technique called **flattening** since we\u2019re\ntransforming the hierarchical JSON data into a non-hierarchical structure. SQL\nServer has a function called OPENJSON that can be used to flatten JSON. A real\ndata transformation plan might look something like this:\n\n **Requirement #**|  **Business Logic**  \n---|---  \n1| Insert data from sourceJSONTable into destinationTable  \n2| Select the following objects:\n\n  * Country\n  * State\n  * Abbreviation\n  * City\n\n  \n3| Flatten JSON using OPENJSON functionality  \n4| De-duplicate records leaving only distinct records  \n  \n### Step 5. Perform the data transformation\n\nWe can write a simple SQL script that utilizes the OPENJSON function in SQL\nServer to perform the data transformation. The OPENJSON function flattens each\nof the JSON hierarchies in our source data.\n\n    \n    \n    insert into destinationTable(country, [state], abbreviation, city)\n    select country,\n    t.value as [state],\n    c.[key] as abbreviation,\n    c.value as city\n    from sourceJSONTable st\n    cross apply OPENJSON(st.jsonData)\n    with (country varchar(20), states nvarchar(max) as JSON, cities nvarchar(max) as JSON) s\n    cross apply OPENJSON(s.states) t\n    cross apply OPENJSON(s.cities) a\n    cross apply openJSON(a.value) c\n    where (t.value = 'Minnesota' and c.[key] = 'MN')\n    or (t.value = 'California' and c.[key] = 'CA')\n    or (t.value = 'Washington' and c.[key] = 'WA')\n\nNotice the **WHERE** clause filters the data based on the state and\nabbreviation relationship. That\u2019s because the cross apply causes the records\nto join all the other records in a many-to- many relationship, duplicating our\n**state** data. For example, without filtering in the WHERE clause, our data\nwould look like this:\n\n  \nWe would be inserting a bunch of incorrect data into the destination table if\nwe didn\u2019t include filtering in our data transformation. Filtering, removing\nduplicates, joining data, or feature engineering can all be a part of\nperforming the data transformation before loading it into storage.\n\n### 6\\. Review the data transformation\n\nAfter executing the INSERT script, select data from the destination table to\nverify the records look correct.\n\n    \n    \n    select * from destinationTable\n\nAs expected, we see our three rows in the destination table. And there you\nhave it\u2014that\u2019s how to transform data using the 4-step process we outlined\nearlier: **discovering, planning, performing, reviewing**.\n\n## 4\\. Benefits of data transformation\n\nThe biggest benefit of transforming data is that it makes data easier to work\nwith by improving consistency and data quality. In general, data plays an\nimportant role in organizations, allowing them to understand their users,\naudit financials, revise internal processes, identify trends, and make\nforecasts and predictions.\n\nEven with all of their data, unless they utilize data transformations to join,\naggregate, consolidate, or enrich their data, gaining insight from it could be\nimpossible. Consider the following ways data transformation benefits\norganizations:\n\n### Improved data quality\n\nThe data transformation pipeline cleans up things like duplicates, null\nvalues, and outliers. We also make sure the structure of the data is\ntransformed to match the destination system so it can be queried and accessed\nthe same way. Beyond cleaning and restructuring, data transformation can also\ninclude aggregating and feature engineering. Ultimately, improving data\nquality through  data transformation makes modeling the data much easier.\n\n### Better data accessibility\n\nTransforming data so it can be stored in the same place overcomes one of the\nbiggest obstacles in data analytics: Breaking down data silos. Organizations\ntend to keep data in silos. For example, customer data could be in one\ndatabase while product event logs are in another, and sales data in yet\nanother. Data transformation makes it possible to store all the records in one\nplace, in the same format.\n\n### Simpler data governance\n\nSince data can be generated from many sources and stored in many silos,\nmanaging data can be very challenging. Data transformation can be used to\ngenerate metadata to help organizations keep track of which data are sensitive\nand need to be regulated. Good metadata makes data easier to manage.\n\n## 5\\. Challenges of data transformation\n\nThere are many challenges that come with trying to transform data. Working\nwith big data can be very resource intensive and expensive because it takes a\nlot of processing power and computation to transform billions of records. Data\ntransformation also requires both a lot of domain knowledge, and a lot of\nexpertise with the underlying technologies used in the ETL/ELT pipelines.\n\n### Compute-resource intensive\n\nBig data means powerful resources are required to transform it. If you don\u2019t\nhave powerful hardware handling the data transformation pipeline, the systems\ncan run out of memory or be too inefficient to keep up with all of the data.\nFor example, I was running a data transformation on millions of records,\njoining data from one table with another.\n\nThe server I was using didn\u2019t have enough RAM to complete the operation, so my\nprocess kept running into Out Of Memory errors. When these types of errors\nhappen, it takes a lot of time and effort to re-plan and retry the data\ntransformation.\n\n### Expensive\n\nData transformation can be an expensive endeavor since it can require a lot of\nstorage and a lot of expertise. ETL/ELT pipelines need to store the\ntransformed data so it can be used for analysis. That means an organization\nneeds a data warehouse in addition to the databases that store the raw data.\n\nBeyond the costs of additional storage, Data engineers, analysts, and data\nscientists are well-paying, in-demand jobs. Organizations might not be able to\nafford many of them, leaving a small team with the burden of managing big data\noperations.\n\n### Requires domain knowledge\n\nAs an experienced product analyst working in education technology for the past\n10 years, I\u2019m all too familiar with the challenges of transforming education\ndata. For example, there are multiple calculations used to aggregate\nattendance data, or generate GPAs, or score standardized tests.\n\nWithout the domain knowledge, data transformation can result in errors and\ninconsistencies that lead to bad analysis and incorrect predictions. It can\ntake a lot of time and effort to develop the domain knowledge necessary for\neffective data transformation.\n\n## 6\\. Summary\n\nAs organizations capture bigger data from more and more sources, efficiently\ntransforming data as a part of an ETL/ELT pipeline becomes necessary for data-\ndriven decision making. Data transformation is the process by which raw data\nis made to work with downstream processes and is done in four steps:\ndiscovering, planning, performing, reviewing.\n\nThere are many benefits to transforming data, such as improving the data\nquality, enabling and empowering data analytics and data modeling processes,\nand improving data governance practices. Although data transformation improves\nan organization\u2019s ability to make data-driven decisions, it can be very\nchallenging to transform big data. Working with big data requires powerful\ncomputer hardware, lots of storage space, and expert-level domain knowledge.\n\nRegardless of the challenges, data transformation remains an important aspect\nof data management, and it helps organizations get the most from their data.\nIf this guide and tutorial to data transformation has piqued your interest in\nthe field of data analytics, why not try out our **free, 5-day introductory\ndata analytics short course**?\n\nYou might also be interested in the following topics:\n\n  * The best SQL certifications for aspiring data analysts\n  * What is linear regression?\n  * A complete guide to time series analysis and forecasting\n\n### What You Should Do Now\n\n  1.

Is it worth getting a data analytics certificate?\n\nIn a word, yes. Data analytics isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it has huge implications\nfor business.\n\nData analytics enables companies like Netflix and Spotify to personalize their\nofferings down to the very last detail. It allows marketers to understand\ncustomer behavior like never before. It\u2019s transforming education, healthcare,\ntravel, and politics\u2014to name just a few.\n\nThose who can work with and leverage data are seen as extremely valuable, and\ncompanies both big and small are turning to data analysts to help them secure\na competitive edge.\n\n### But can\u2019t you just teach yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s true that you can master at least some **data analytics tools** and\ntechniques yourself\u2014in fact, you probably already have. If you use Excel or\nGoogle Analytics, for example, you\u2019ll understand some of the basic concepts.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a big difference between performing very simple analyses and\nbeing able to call yourself a qualified data analyst. With that in mind, there\nare many advantages of completing formal training in the field and obtaining a\ncertification.\n\n### Benefits of a data analytics certification\n\nHere\u2019s just a short roundup of the different advantages having a cert listed\non your data analyst resume.\n\nCredibility\n\nWhen hiring a data analyst, employers are looking for a thorough understanding\nof the key concepts, together with the ability to apply your knowledge to\nreal-world problems. While self-taught analysts may well know their way around\na dataset, a certification demonstrates that you\u2019ve been through extensive,\nhands-on training.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that self-taught analysts aren\u2019t as qualified as those who\nhave completed a program or course, but a certification from a reputable\ninstitution instantly sets you apart as a credible, professionally trained\nanalyst. Employers can see instantly that you\u2019ve mastered the necessary\nskills\u2014immediately putting you in the running for any data analyst role.\n\nIf you\u2019re brand new to the field, a certification program will take you right\nfrom A-Z, leaving you with the skills, confidence, and credentials needed to\nstart your career as a data analyst. Even if you don\u2019t necessarily want the\ndata analyst job title, a certification will undoubtedly prove valuable in\nyour current role.\n\nCurriculum\n\nAs the list of top courses earlier has shown you, data analytics\ncertifications are typically based on a comprehensive curriculum that covers\nall of the essential data analysis skills and tools. This ensures that you are\ngetting a well-rounded education and that you are prepared for the demands of\nthe job.\n\nYour employer might be willing to pay for it\n\nAs more and more companies recognize the value of data analytics, those who\ncan apply it to their jobs are an excellent asset for any team. As a result,\ncompanies are more willing to invest their professional development or\nemployee training budgets in certification courses for their employees. The\nright certification program will allow you to expand your skillset and excel\nin your current position, or transition to another one in the same firm.\n\nMentorship and support\n\nMany data analytics certification programs offer mentorship and support from\nexperienced professionals. This can be invaluable for learning new skills,\ntroubleshooting problems, and getting yourself situated in the data analytics\nworld. For career-changers in particular, the guidance and support provided by\na data mentor can be massively valuable.\n\nNetworking opportunities\n\nSimply put, you won\u2019t be studying alone. Data analytics certification course\ncan also provide you with opportunities to network with other data analysts\nand professionals in the field.\n\nAs well as your fellow learners, your community will also involve those who\u2019ve\ncome before you and are already working in the industry. This can help you to\nlearn about new job opportunities and to build relationships that can benefit\nyour career in the long-run.\n\nIn short, a data analytics certification will equip you with some of the most\nin-demand skills in today\u2019s business world\u2014and provide you with an instantly\nrecognizable qualification.\n\n**However:** Not all data analytics certifications are created equal! Before\nyou invest, it\u2019s important to do your research and ensure you find a course\nthat matches your budget, availability, skill level, and aspirations.\n\n## 3\\.

What skills do you need to become a data analyst?\n\nA high-quality data analytics certification will ideally set you up to succeed\nin most entry-level jobs in the field.\n\nSo what does that mean, exactly? It means you\u2019ll learn about how to deal with\nevery aspect of the data analysis process: from data cleaning to creating\nvisualizations, and everything in between.\n\nWhen working as a data analyst, you\u2019ll need to have some knowledge or\nexperience in the following hard skills/tools:\n\n  * Programming languages, such as Python\n  * Querying languages, such as SQL or SAS\n  * Data visualization tools, such as Tableau\n  * Microsoft Excel (or Google Sheets)\n  * Decision making\n  * Building data sets\n  * Data optimization\n  * Machine learning algorithms\n  * Predictive modeling\n  * Statistical analysis\n  * Data engineering\n  * Regression analysis\n\nSome required skills of a data analyst will be things that you may have\nlearned in other fields of work\u2014such as communication skills or problem-\nsolving skills.
