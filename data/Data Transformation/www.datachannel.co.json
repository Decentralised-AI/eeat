Uses of Data Transformation in Analytics\n\nData transformations typically involve converting a raw data source into a\ncleansed, validated and ready-to-use format.\n\nDataChannel Research\n\n7 mins to read\n\n\"Big data\u201d isn\u2019t just a word but a challenge that every data-driven\norganization is facing in the present time. The variety and volume of data are\ngrowing at a tremendous rate, making it difficult for organizations to break\nthe complex data silos and drive insights.Data has become a thing, that if\ntransformed correctly, can become a game-changer for all-size organizations.\nThis factor alone calls for the need to incorporate the best data\ntransformation practices to speed up your analytics process. But before moving\non to the uses of data transformation in analytics, we must first learn what\ndata transformation is.\n\n##  **What is Data Transformation?**\n\nData transformation is a process of converting raw data into a single and\neasy-to-read format to facilitate easy analysis. To turn your data into\nsomething meaningful, you must have the right data transformation tool by your\nside.\n\nData transformation is also known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which\nsums up the steps involved in transforming data. As per ETL, the data is first\nextracted from multiple sources, transformed into a required format, and then\nloaded into a data warehouse for powering analysis and reporting processes.\n\n**DataChannel** offers a data integration platform that helps you get relief\nfrom the tiresome and manual process of data transformation. We provide you a\nscalable warehouse with the level of customization you need to transform all\nyour data from different sources into a preferred format. The platform is\ndesigned to work best with any cloud-service provider so that you can access\nyour sensitive business information from anywhere and at any time. With our\nservices at your end, you can easily extract, transform, manage, and utilize\nlarge volumes of data like a pro.\n\nThere are mainly two stages of data transformation, which are as following:\n\n###  **Stage 1 \u2013 Understanding and mapping the data:**\n\nThe first stage of data transformation involves the identification of the data\nsources. Once each data source is identified, the next step is to determine\ntheir structure and what type of data transformation will be required to\nintegrate them. You can connect your data sources based on the kind of\ninformation they contain or how the information of one source is related to\nanother. After combining all your data, the next step is data mapping, in\nwhich you will define how the fields of all data sources are connected and the\nkind of transformation they require.\n\n###  **Stage 2 \u2013 Transforming the data:**\n\nIn this stage, you have to perform the different transformations you mapped to\nthe fields of your data sources. You can use different strategies for\ntransforming the data, such as:\n\n  *  **Hand-Coding ETL Solutions:** Earlier, the ETL process was set up by hand-writing code in Python or SQL. The task can be carried by offsite developers but is time-consuming. Additionally, it often results in unintentional errors and misunderstandings as developers, sometimes, fail to interpret the exact requirements.\n  *  **Onsite Server-Based ETL Solutions:** These solutions work through onsite servers to extract, transform, and load information into an onsite data warehouse. Although big data companies have moved to more advanced cloud-based ETL or data warehousing solutions, onsite ETL still holds its value.\n  *  **Cloud-Based ETL Solutions:** Cloud-based ETL solutions, like DataChannel,  have simplified the process of data transformation. Instead of working on an onsite server, they work through the cloud. With these solutions at your end, you can link your cloud-based SaaS platforms with any cloud-based data warehouse. This will help you access your crucial business information from anywhere and at any time. You can even integrate your onsite business system with the cloud-based data warehouse to control and manage all your data much more efficiently.\n\n##  **Why is it necessary to transform data?**\n\nEvery business generates a good amount of data daily, but the same is not\nuseful until it is transformed into a useful format. To get benefitted from\nraw data, its transformation is necessary. With data transformation, you can\nmake different pieces of data compatible with one another, move them to\nanother system, and join with other data to drive useful business insights.\n\nHere are other few reasons stating why data transformation is necessary:\n\n  * To move your data to a new store like a cloud data warehouse, you first need to change the data types.\n  * To add other information to your data like geolocation, or timestamps.\n  * To combine unstructured data with unstructured one.\n  * To perform aggregations like comparing sales data from different regions.\n\nRaw data is like unrefined gold, precious to businesses, but to derive value\nfrom it, the same needs to be transformed. By getting your data lined up in a\nspecific format, you can have a unified view of your business operations that\nfurther helps you to make result-oriented business decisions.\n\n##  **How to transform data?**\n\nData transformation acts as a power booster for the analytics process and\nhelps you make better data-driven decisions. The process of data\ntransformation begins with extracting the data and flattening the curve of its\ntypes. This is done to make the data compatible with your analytics systems.\nThe further process is carried by data analysts and data scientists that work\non the individual layers of data. Every layer helps in designing or outlining\nspecific sets of tasks that help you meet business goals. The use of data\ntransformation in analytics and how it serves the various functions of your\nanalytics stack.\n\n###  **Extraction and Parsing**\n\nData aggregation starts with extracting the data from multiple source systems\nand copying the same to its destination. The transformation process starts\nwith structuring the data into a single format, so it becomes compatible with\nthe system in which it is copied and the other data available in it. Parsing\nis a process of analyzing data structures and confirming the same with the\nrules of grammar.\n\n###  **Translation and Mapping**\n\nTranslation and mapping are part of the basic steps of data transformation.\nData translation is a process of converting big amounts of data from one\nformat to a preferred one when it is transferred from one system to another.\nAt the same time, data mapping is all about finding matching fields between\ntwo distinct data models.\n\n###  **Filtering, aggregation, and summarization**\n\nData combined from different sources may bring unnecessary columns, fields,\nand records with them. What if we tell you the same can be avoided by applying\nthe necessary filters? Yes, you read it right. Irrelevant data can be omitted\nfrom the extraction process by using data filtering.Data can also be\nsummarized or aggregated by, for example, transforming a time series of\ncustomer transactions to daily or hourly sales count.Business Intelligence\n(BI) tools can help you to perform filtration and aggregation. In case you\nwant a more efficient approach, it\u2019s better to do the transformations before a\nreporting tool accesses the data.\n\n###  **Enrichment and Imputation**\n\nData from diverse sources can be merged to create enriched information. For\nexample, merging the customers\u2019 transactions with their information table can\nmake the process of customer analysis more efficient. The long fields can be\nsplit into multiple columns to fill the missing values, or corrupted values\ncan be removed for enriching the available data. This will boost the process\nof data analysis and provide you relevant and accurate business insights.\n\n###  **Indexing and Ordering**\n\nData must be transformed to become logical and comply with the data storage\nscheme. You can create indexes to optimize the performance of a database. It\nwill also help you to locate and access the required data in a database\nquickly.\n\n###  **Anonymization and encryption**\n\nData anonymization refers to any piece of data that cannot be reversibly\ntransformed. It is done to protect the identification of a particular set of\ninformation or individual. Now, the level of competition among organizations\nhas become tough and calls for the encryption of private data. You can encrypt\ndata at multiple levels, ranging from individual databases to entire records.\n\n###  **Modeling, typecasting, formatting, and renaming**\n\nA whole bunch of transformations that help you reshape your data into the\ndesired format without changing the content. It makes your data compatible by\ncasting and converting data types, renaming columns, tables, and schemas for\nbetter clarity, and adjusting times and dates with format localization.\n\n###  **Refining the data transformation process**\n\nBefore transforming the data, it\u2019s important you replicate it to a data\nwarehouse built for analytics. If you want to make the most out of your ELT\nsolution, it\u2019s better to opt for a cloud data warehouse, like the one provided\nby DataChannel.\n\n##  **Challenges in Data Transformation**\n\nEverything has its pros and cons, and the same goes for data transformation.\nThere are certain challenges in the process of data transformation, which are\nas follows:\n\n  * Slow: The extraction and transformation of large volumes of data are difficult to be processed in one go and can become a burden on your system. Therefore, the same is carried in batches, which means that the next batch has to wait for hours until the first one is entirely transformed. This thing can delay the making of crucial business decisions and result in missing growth opportunities.\n  * Time-consuming: Cleansing of unstructured data can take a lot of time before it becomes ready for a transformation. This is one of the biggest complaints of data scientists or analysts working with unstructured data.\n  * Expensive: The size of your infrastructure will impact your data transformation requirements. With a bigger infrastructure, you will require a team of data experts to manage the data, resulting in more expense.\n\n## DataChannel \u2013 An integrated ETL & Reverse ETL solution\n\n  *  **100+ Data Sources**.

It allows organizations to bring\ntheir data from various locations and formats it into meaningful information.\nThe formatting process not only improves the data quality but protects\napplications from making errors like null values, incorrect indexing,\nunexpected duplicates, and incompatible formats. The right data transformation\npractices will help you ensure compatibility between your systems,\napplications, and types of data. Different types of data have different\ntransformation needs, and by incorporating the best solution, you can turn\nyour data into a fuel that will drive your business towards success.\n\n## Related Posts\n\nData Transformation\n\n##### Announcing DataChannel\u2019s Integration with dbt\n\nDataChannel X dbt\u2122: Access transformed data across business applications to\nbuild end-to-end ELT & Reverse ETL workflows in a few clicks.\n\nArti Gupta\n\n7 min to read\n\nData Transformation\n\n##### Unlocking the power of Data Transformation with dbt (Part III)\n\nIn the final blog on dbt, we'll look at the various use cases of data\ntransformation using dbt and how it can be used to overcome organizational\nbottlenecks.\n\nArti Gupta\n\n6 min to read\n\nData Transformation\n\n##### Unlocking the Power of Data Transformation with dbt (Part II)\n\nIn the second part of our series we discuss how dbt enables modular data\nmodeling, dbt products, and the differentiating features of dbt.\n\nArti Gupta\n\n5 min to read\n\n## Try DataChannel Free for 14 days\n\nNo contracts, no credit card.  \n\nGet started now\n\nWrite to us at info@datachannel.co\n\nThe first 14 days are on us\n\nFree hands-on onboarding & support\n\nSimple usage based pricing\n\ninfo@datachannel.co\n\n###### Platform\n\nOverviewExtract, Load &TransformActivate - Reverse ETLPricingLog In\n\n###### Integrations\n\nData SourcesData WarehousesData Destinations\n\n###### Solutions\n\nDigital Marketing & AnalyticsData Engineers & AnalystsIT, Product Teams &\nEngineering\n\n###### Company\n\nHomeCustomersAbout UsContact UsCareers\n\n###### Resources\n\nBlogCase StudiesHow we compareDocumentationTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyGDPR\nGuidelines\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved.
