Four Steps\n\n# The Data Transformation Process Explained in Four Steps\n\nChristopher Tozzi | November 14, 2022\n\nShare on:\n\nLinkedIn |  Twitter |  Facebook\n\nThese days, understanding the steps involved in the data transformation\nprocess is important, even if data transformation is not a primary part of\nyour job.\n\nBecause we live in a world where data is collected, stored, and analyzed in so\nmany different formats, being able to perform the basic steps required to\ntransform data from one form to another is a common requirement for many of\nus.\n\nThis article explains what those steps are by outlining a typical data\ntransformation process.\n\n## The data transformation process\n\nWhile the exact nature of data transformation will vary from situation to\nsituation, the steps below are the most common parts of the data\ntransformation process.\n\n### Step 1: Data interpretation\n\nThe first step in data transformation is interpreting your data to determine\nwhich type of data you currently have, and what you need to transform it into.\n\nData interpretation can be harder than it looks. As a simple example, consider\nthe fact that many operating systems and applications make assumptions about\nhow data is formatted based on the extension that is appended to a file name.\nThus, your computer is likely to assume that a file name video.avi is a video\nfile, or that text.doc is a Microsoft Word file.\n\nThe problem with these labels is that the actual data inside a given file (or\na directory or database) could be very different from what the file name\nsuggests. Users can add whichever extensions they want to a file name;\nchanging the extension doesn\u2019t actually transform the data.\n\nFor this reason, interpreting data accurately requires tools that can peer\ndeeper inside the structure of a file or database to see what is really\ninside, instead of what a file name or database table name suggests is inside.\nTools like the Linux command-line utility _file_ are useful for this purpose.\n\nOf course, you also need to determine the target format \u2013 in other words, the\nformat that your data should have after transformation is complete. If you do\nnot already know that format, you\u2019ll want to read the documentation for the\ntool or system that will receive your transformed data to determine which\nformats it supports or expects.\n\nRead the Report\n\n## Forbes Insights report - The Data Differentiator \u2013 How Improving Data\nQuality Improves Business\n\nLearn how data quality is the data differentiator, including how to bring\noutside data in and choose a data partner.\n\nRead\n\n### Step 2: Pre-translation data quality check\n\nOnce you (or your data transformation tool) have figured out which kind of\ndata formats you are working with and which forms you will transform data\ninto, you should run a data quality check. A data quality check allows you to\nidentify problems, such as missing or corrupt values within a database, in the\nsource data that could lead to problems during later steps of the data\ntransformation process.\n\n### Step 3: Data translation\n\nAfter the data quality of your source data has been maximized, you can begin\nthe process of actually translating data. Data translation means taking each\npart of your source data and replacing it with data that fits within the\nformatting requirements or your target data format.\n\nFor example, you may be transforming an old HTML file that was written using\nan outdated HTML standard into HTML5, the latest standard, and the one that\nmost modern Web browsers expect. Part of the data translation process, in this\ncase, would involve replacing deprecated HTML tags, such as <dir> (a tag that\nwas used in old versions of HTML to help create lists), with <ul> (the list\ntag supported by modern HTML).\n\nData translation often entails not just replacing individual pieces of data\nwith another piece, but also restructuring the overall file in a significant\nway.\n\nFor example, a CSV file that is formatted as a series of comma-separated words\nwould require considerable restructuring to convert into an XML file, which\norganizes information using cascading hierarchies of tags.\n\n### Step 4: Post-translation data quality check\n\nIn order to ensure that your translated data will be maximally useful, you\nwill also want to perform a data quality check. In this step of the process,\nyou look for inconsistencies, missing information or other errors that may\nhave been introduced during the data translation process.\n\nEven if your data was error-free before translation, there is a decent chance\nthat problems will have been introduced during translation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn most real-world scenarios, the data transformation steps described above\nwould be performed automatically by software tools. So, if these steps sound\nlike work that you are not prepared to perform, then worry not.\n\nStill, it\u2019s valuable for human operators to understand what their data\ntransformation tools are doing at each step of the data transformation\nprocess, and how each action adds up to make data transformation possible.\n\nFor more information about the importance of data quality, read this Forbes\nInsights report: The Data Differentiator \u2013 How Improving Data Quality Improves\nBusiness\n\ndata transformation data transformation steps\n\n## The Data Differentiator - How Improving Data Quality Improves Business\n\nLearn how data quality is the data differentiator, including how to bring\noutside data in and choose a data partner.\n\nRead\n\n### Related posts\n\n###  Streaming Data Pipelines: What Are They and How to Build One\n\nThe concept of streaming data was born of necessity.
