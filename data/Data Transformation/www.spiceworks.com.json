Types, Tools, and Importance\n\nData transformation helps convert data from one format, standard, or structure\nto another to prepare it for usage\n\nChiradeep BasuMallick Technical Writer\n\nOctober 17, 2022\n\n* * *\n\n______\n\n  \n\n**_Data transformation is defined as the technical process of converting data\nfrom one format, standard, or structure to another \u2013 without changing the\ncontent of the datasets \u2013 typically to prepare it for consumption by an app or\na user or to improve the data quality. This article explains the importance of\ndata transformation, its different types and techniques, and the best tools\nyou can use to transform data.  _**\n\n### Table of Contents __\n\n  * What Is Data Transformation?\n  * Types of Data Transformation\n  * Top 6 Data Transformation Tools\n  * Importance of Data Transformation\n\n## What Is Data Transformation?\n\n**Data transformation is the technical process of converting data from one\nformat, standard, or structure to another \u2013 without changing the content of\nthe datasets \u2013 typically to prepare it for consumption by an app or a user or\nto improve the data quality.**\n\nData transformation is known as modifying the format, organization, or values\nof data. Data can be changed at two points in the data pipeline when used for\ndata analytics projects. Companies that utilize on-premises data warehouses\noften apply an ETL (extract, transform, load) methodology, with data\ntransformation functioning as the intermediate step. Cloud-based data\nwarehouses may expand computational and storage capacity with delay estimated\nin seconds or minutes.\n\nUsing ELT (extract, load, transform), organizations may load raw data straight\ninto data warehouses without preload adjustments and convert it when a query\nis received. Data transformation might be used in various operations, such as\ndata migration, warehousing, integration, and wrangling.\n\nIn addition, it is crucial for any organization that seeks to leverage its\ndata to provide timely business insights. Organizations need a reliable method\nfor utilizing data to put it to good use for their operations as the number of\ndata has increased. Data transformation is a component of using this data\nsince, when performed effectively, it ensures that the information is\naccessible, consistent, safe, and eventually acknowledged by the targeted\nbusiness users.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go into the data transformation procedure\u2019s steps:\n\n### 1\\. Discovery of data\n\nIdentifying and interpreting the original data format is the first step.\nTypically, a data profiling tool is used to achieve this. This stage assists\nyou in determining what must be done to the data to transform it into the\nrequired format. Data professionals apply data profiling techniques or scripts\nto grasp the data\u2019s structure and features and determine how users should\nmodify it.\n\n### 2\\. Data mapping\n\nThe actual transformation process is planned during this stage\u2014data\nspecialists\u2019 method of matching or connecting data elements from one resource\nto another.\n\n### 3\\. Code generation\n\nFor the conversion process to be successful, constructing a code to execute\nthe transformation task is essential. Typically, a tool or platform for data\ntransformation is employed to produce these codes. In this process phase, the\ncomputer code needed to transform the data is created through data\ntransformation technologies or by data experts developing scripts.\n\n### 4\\. Code execution\n\nCode execution sets the previously planned and coded data transformation\nprocess into motion, transforming the input data into the desired output. Data\nis collected from the source(s), which may be structured, streaming,\ntelemetry, or log files. The data is then transformed by operations like\naggregation, format conversion, or merging as planned during the mapping\nstage. The data is changed at this point.\n\n### 5\\. Review\n\nThe formatting of transformed data is examined to ensure accuracy. During this\nstep, data professionals or end users check that the data flow fulfills the\npredetermined transformation criteria and, if not, address and correct any\nanomalies or mistakes. Additionally, not all data requires transformation;\nsometimes, it can simply be used as-is.\n\nNotably, the meaning and process of data transformation can vary based on the\ntechniques used. These include:\n\n  * **Revising:** Revising the data necessarily and adequately makes sure that the data supports the intended usage. This is accomplished in several ways. By removing duplications from the data set, dataset normalization improves the data. Data purification guarantees that the data can be formatted.\n  * **Manipulation:** This entails generating new values from old ones or modifying the state of the data through computing. Users can also transform unstructured data into structured data that machine learning algorithms can exploit through manipulation.\n  * **Separating:** Granular analysis entails segmenting the data values into their component pieces. By splitting, you generate separate columns for every one of the values in a column containing multiple values. This enables filtering based on specific values.\n  * **Combining/integrating:** Records from many tables and sources are integrated to get a complete picture of an organization\u2019s operations. It combines data from different tables and databases, including information on couples.\n  * **Data smoothing:** The data set is cleaned up using this method by removing irrelevant, noisy, or corrupted data. Trends are best discovered by eliminating outliers.\n  * **Data aggregation:** This method collects raw data from many sources and transforms it into an analysis-ready summary form. Raw data that provides statistics like averages and sums is an example.\n  * **Discretization:** To increase the effectiveness and make an analysis of continuous data easier, interval labels are constructed using this technique. To convert big data sets into categorical data, decision tree algorithms are used in this process.\n  * **Generalization:** By employing the idea of hierarchies and building layers of sequential summary data, low-level data attributes can be converted into high-level attributes. Clear data snapshots are produced as a result.\n  * **Building attributes:** This approach expedites the mining process by permitting the development of a new collection of characteristics from an existing set.\n\n**See More:** **Top 10 Open Source Artificial Intelligence Software in 2021**\n\n## Types of Data Transformation\n\nDepending on the technique used and the desired outcome, data transformation\nmay be classified into six categories:\n\n### 1\\. Data transformation through scripting\n\nThrough scripting, data can be extracted and transformed by writing code in\nPython or structured query language (SQL). You can automate several processes\nusing scripting languages like Python and SQL in software. In addition, they\nenable data collections to be mined for information. Scripting languages are\nless intensive since less code is needed than in conventional programming\nlanguages.\n\nWith the help of programming languages like Python, one can modify multiple\njobs, allowing the company to manage schedules, jobs, and other business\noperations. Before writing an event to an XML file, transformation scripts are\nused to alter its contents or structure.\n\n### 2\\. The use of on-premises ETL tools\n\nSince on-premise ETL software is deployed internally, you have total control\nover its modification and security. Furthermore, the software enables you to\nconduct hundreds of jobs at once. On-premise software is quicker than cloud\nsoftware since the data is first sent to the manufacturer\u2019s server and then\nrecovered in an alternate format.\n\nIt is favored by businesses that want to keep their data and need a certain\namount of privacy and protection. These businesses, including banking and\ngovernment, hold extra-sensitive information. One can use these tools\nremotely, but they frequently require third-party connectors to interface with\nmobile devices.\n\n### 3\\. The use of cloud-based ETL tools\n\nThe ownership of data in a cloud-based environment is highly ambiguous, a\nproblem many businesses have encountered. Accessing data in an unforeseen\nevent will be challenging because encryption and data keys are stored with a\nthird-party supplier.\n\nHowever, many cloud-based ETL systems make it simple to access them from\nmobile devices, and some of them even include native mobile apps. But with\nincreased accessibility comes higher security concerns, mainly if employees\nuse mobile devices to access company files. Resources are housed and managed\nby the public cloud hosting service provider in cloud-based ETL tools.\n\n### 4\\. Constructive and destructive data transformation\n\nTo fill in the blanks and standardize the data, constructive transformation\ninvolves adding, copying, and replicating raw data. The process may eliminate\nentire fields and records when data is cleaned and made more usable through\ndestructive transformation. Programs are intricate, challenging to comprehend,\nand prone to errors because they have to be effective, according to the core\npremise of the transformation approach to program development. This entails\nstructuring the creation of software as a development process, eventually\nsacrificing clarity for the economy.\n\n### 5\\. Structural data transformation\n\nReorganization is another term to use for structural change. Data can be\ncombined, divided, rearranged, and even generate bespoke data structures.\nColumns may be combined, moved, or given new names to restructure the\ndatabase. Structural transformations can be categorized in four ways based on\nhow they modify a dataset\u2019s geometry, topology, and characteristics.\n\nTransformation can be simple or complicated, depending on the initial and\nfinal target data. Columns may be renamed, moved, or combined as part of\nstructural data transformation. Data transformation, at its most fundamental,\nis the process of transforming unusable data into usable data.\n\n### 6\\. Aesthetic data transformation\n\nStylistic modifications, like standardizing street names or other values, are\na part of aesthetic evolution. However, combining or moving columns is part of\na structural restructuring. Following the aesthetic ideas that have arisen in\nevery era, the way data aesthetics is seen has changed.\n\nTo comply with specifications or parameters, the transformation standardizes\nthe data. Organizations can learn much about operational and informational\ntasks by transforming their data. Data transformation has become a crucial\ntool for businesses because of the enormous amounts of data from many sources\nthey must manage daily.\n\n**See More:** **What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Service? Definition,\nArchitecture, and Trends**\n\n## Top 6 Data Transformation Tools\n\nCompanies may employ robust tools to accomplish the data transformation\ncategories and procedures outlined above. Among the most effective data\ntransformation technologies on the market, today are:\n\n### 1\\. IBM InfoSphere\n\nA straightforward tool for data integration, IBM InfoSphere DataStage can\neasily clean, edit, and convert your data.

SAP Data Services\n\nData integration, transformation, profiling, and text data processing are all\navailable on a single platform using SAP Data Services, an ETL solution.\nThrough both ETL and ELT procedures, SAP Data Services, a product of SAP,\ncombines and processes data from SAP or outside sources.\n\nThe data management platform includes a range of capabilities for data\nintegration, quality assurance, and cleansing. You can create data-\ntransforming applications on the platform. By connecting to new data sources,\nthe software supports database management systems, applications, files, etc.\nIt links to additional external data sources and interfaces with other SAP\nBusiness Suite apps.\n\n### 3\\. Dataform\n\nOne can manage all their processes in cloud data warehouses with Dataform, a\nfree and open-source data transformation tool (including Panoply, Snowflake,\nRedshift, and BigQuery). Someone familiar with SQL could use the command line\nto develop robust data transformation pipelines by utilizing SQLX.\n\nAs a result, data engineers may use the ref function to establish dependencies\nacross tables quickly. They can now focus more on analytics rather than\nmaintaining the data infrastructure. Dataform is a potent data transformation\ntool for data engineers who love SQL.\n\n### 4\\. Azure Data Factory\n\nOne can clean, merge, and format enterprise data at scale with the aid of Data\nFactory by Microsoft Azure. The serverless tool Data Factory enables you to\nintegrate data sources visually. You can therefore choose to construct ETL or\nELT pipelines and allow Data Factory automatically generate the code in\naddition to writing your code.\n\nTop compliance organizations like CSA STAR, HIPAA, and HITECH have accredited\nAzure Data Factory. Your digital transformation initiatives can use the data\ntransformation layer that Data Factory offers. It employs a pay-as-you-go\nstrategy, simplifying it for you to scale up or down to your needs.\n\n### 5\\. Qlik Compose\n\nThanks to Qlik Compose, an agile ETL automation and data transformation tool,\ndata administrators are relieved of onerous and error-prone manual coding.\nQlik Compose significantly cuts down on the time, expense, and risk of data\ntransformation for business intelligence projects by optimizing the design of\ndata warehouses and automatically creating ETL code.\n\nWith Qlik Compose for Data Warehouse, you can easily design, build, manage,\nand update data warehouses like Oracle, Amazon Redshift, and Azure Synapse.\nThe process of sending consistently updated, reliable, and trustworthy data to\nbig data platforms like Apache Hadoop is automated by Qlik Compose for Data\nLakes.\n\n### 6\\. Data Build Tool (dbt)\n\nOne can write code to immediately start data transformation and take command\nof the entire data pipeline. Version control, logging, modularity, and Git\nintegrations are all supported natively. In well-known data warehouses like\nBigQuery, Redshift, and Snowflake, converting SQL queries into tables and\nviews is simple because every data model is a straightforward SELECT\nstatement.\n\nThe \u201cref function,\u201d which enables people to reference one data model within\nanother, is a neat feature of dbt. Additionally, this strategy aids in the\nautomatic generation of dependency graphs. Therefore, their materialized\ntables in the graph are also updated in the proper sequence.\n\n**See More:** **What Is Machine Learning? Definition, Types, Applications, and\nTrends for 2022**\n\n## Importance of Data Transformation\n\nWhy is data transformation so crucial in the age of AI and data-powered\ndecisions? Well, the answer comes down to five key factors:\n\n### 1\\. Analyzing global markets is made simpler by data transformation\n\nOne will probably need to use specific currency changes if a campaign spans\ninternational boundaries or serves customers in various nations. However, it\u2019s\ncritical to be cautious and strategic in this situation. This is one of those\noccasions where one can choose to drift off into the vast, black ocean depths\nor stay cozy by their figurative reef.\n\nWhen dealing with money, it is essential to consider historical versus current\nconversion rates. It could be beneficial to change time zone data to reflect\nthe synchronized global launch when reviewing success metrics in the past.\nThis is just one example of how data transformation can affect financial\nsuccess.\n\n### 2\\. It can deliver altered data to someone\u2019s intended recipient\n\nOne of the most widely used visualization tools available is Google Data\nStudio. It is robust, stable, and free. However, the fact that it can only\ngather information from one source is one of its key drawbacks. Due to this,\npeople frequently observe that clients begin their data journeys by gathering\nall of their data into a sizable Google Sheet and then applying many data\ntransformations to it before integrating it with an app. This is one of the\nkey benefits of data transformation \u2013 i.e., it prepares data for consumption\nby an intended recipient.\n\n### 3\\. Data usage becomes optimized\n\nData transformation can also simplify data used for both people and machines.\nBusinesses are continually producing data from a growing number of human and\nmachine sources. Different data types can be standardized to help firms manage\ntheir data more efficiently. Additionally, as data transformations make it\nsimpler for users to get the data they require, applying this modified data\nfor business results is frequently quicker.\n\nYour data is kept in a source location after being modified and standardized,\nmaking it simple to access and retrieve. This can result in improved customer\nservice, more accessible information sharing, and more precise and effective\ncommunication, to name a few benefits.\n\n### 4\\. Data quality improves, leading to enhanced analytics outcomes\n\nBusinesses must keep an eye on the quality of their data because they\nfrequently base crucial choices on it. Business executives or staff may\noverlook vital information that underpins effective outcomes if some data\ncontains inaccuracies. Poor data comes with a lot of expenses and hazards.\n\nData transformation can assist your company in getting rid of inconsistent\ndata and other quality problems like missing values. Businesses may flag and\neliminate issues like inconsistencies and complete any gaps in the data\nthrough data transformations, ensuring the data\u2019s correctness and quality.\nWhen appropriately utilized, transformation tools can dramatically increase\ndata quality and the efficiency of data analysis.\n\n### 5\\. The scope of data applications increases\n\nMore programs can use the data once you have transformed it. This is due to\nthe particular formatting requirements that apply only to specific programs.\n\nFor instance, a company gathering consumer data in one application might need\nto modify it before analyzing it in another application. As a result, data\ntransformations enable greater data utilization since they make it more\naccessible to other applications. Even though corporations may continually\nacquire data, much of it remains unanalyzed. By standardizing and improving\nthe usability of your data, the transformation makes it simpler to extract the\nmost value from it.\n\n**See More:** **What Is Deep Learning? Definition, Techniques, and Use Cases**\n\n### Takeaway\n\nData transformation is now an essential part of any IT practice. With so many\ndiverse systems and multiple types of datasets at work, you need a degree of\ninteroperability to utilize its full potential. Data transformation makes\ninformation assets workable across systems and platforms. It also enables\ngreater standardization and quality enhancement for enterprise data so you can\nuse it to generate exponential value.\n\n**_Did this article tell you all you were looking to know about data\ntransformation?
