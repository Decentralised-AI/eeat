This is true. A data transformation layer is an important component\nof a modern data stack. It enables a business to automate the validation and\ncleansing of data before it is used downstream, such as with a business\nintelligence tool. In this article, we\u2019ll explain how a data transformation\nlayer works within a modern data stack, the best data transformation tools,\nand how it all comes together within your business\u2019s data strategy.\n\n## What is data transformation, and why is it important?\n\nThe raw data that is stored in the platforms in your tech stack is not\nanalysis-ready. It may contain values that require calculations or\nconcatenations before it can be used in a report or analysis. And it will\ninevitably contain flaws, such as duplicate values, invalid inputs,\ninconsistent formatting, etc. All these issues can be corrected through  _data\ntransformation_.\n\nWithout a data transformation tool in place, the task of transforming data\ntypically falls to either a data scientist or data analyst. This is a time-\nconsuming and error-prone process when completed manually, especially when it\ninvolves multiple data sets from a number of origin sources. The best data\ntransformation tools, such as SQL queries, offer a more efficient and accurate\napproach. The only time a manual intervention would occur is if a spot-check\nerror was discovered. In which case, the SQL query would simply be amended to\ncorrect the issue when running future data transformations.\n\n## How does a data transformation layer work within a modern data stack?\n\nData transformation is typically associated with ETL (extract, transform,\nload). ETL is a process that enables you to select the data you want to be\nextracted from your tech stack, organize it, and then load it into your data\nwarehouse. A data transformation layer, however, is an additional tool that\nsits on top of your data warehouse. It allows you to query the data already\nstored in your data warehouse \u2014 for instance, in order to join values from\nselect tables \u2014 and then validate and cleanse that data before it\u2019s used\ndownstream in a business intelligence tool.\n\nMozart Data\u2019s modern data stack uses a data transformation layer that is built\non a SQL editor, allowing our customers to write SQL queries. While some\npeople prefer R, dbt, or Python, we chose SQL because it\u2019s robust, yet\nrelatively simple to use. This setup allows for automated data transformation\nso you can schedule your transforms in advance. And as your data grows, you\ncan take advantage of  _incremental transforms_  to update just the data you\nneed for your analysis, instead of processing a larger volume of data, which\nwill run slower and increase compute costs.\n\n## How does data transformation fit within a data strategy?\n\nYour business\u2019s tech stack collects a large volume of data. It\u2019s important to\n_develop a data strategy_  that defines the tools, key people, and standard\noperating procedures (SOP) for working with that data. Your data strategy will\nhave clear answers to these questions:\n\n  * What are the components of your modern data stack?\n  * How must the data be handled and processed as it moves from its origin and through the modern data stack, and by whom?\n  * Who defines the rules, oversees these workflows, and owns the SOP?\n\nOnce you create the framework for your data strategy, it\u2019s time to set up your\nmodern data stack. It\u2019s best to think of it as an integrated platform instead\nof having separate parts. We\u2019ve seen businesses do the latter \u2014 starting with\none component and then filling in the gaps as they go \u2014 and it causes them to\nstumble through their data journey. Perhaps they learn about the value of a\ndata warehouse and set up an account with Snowflake. Later they realize they\nneed a good way to get data into their warehouse, so they reach out to\nFivetran. Then they realize they need a transformation layer between their\ndata warehouse and business intelligence tool to improve data quality and\nworkflow efficiency. This piecemeal approach won\u2019t save money and is slower to\nset up than creating an integrated modern data stack at the start.\n\nThe process of setting up a modern data stack doesn\u2019t have to be time-\nconsuming, and you don\u2019t need a team of experts to assemble all of these\nindividual tools. Mozart\u2019s out-of-the-box modern data stack with built-in tech\nintegrations enables you to get started immediately and at a fraction of the\ncost of alternatives.
