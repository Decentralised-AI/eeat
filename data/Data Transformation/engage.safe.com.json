We said it. But, just because this reality is inevitable doesn\u2019t mean\nthere aren\u2019t ways to work around it.\n\nData transformation is the process of applying few or many changes (you\ndecide!) to data to make it valuable to you. Some examples of the types of\nchanges that may take place during data transformation are merging,\naggregating, summarizing, filtering, enriching, splitting, joining, or\nremoving duplicated data.\n\nOften data transformation is a mandatory step needed for further data\nmanagement tasks like data conversion and data integration. Data\ntransformation is a key step in each of these processes because it can help\nshape, standardize, and overall create consistency between various datasets.\nWhether or not you need to convert data into a new file format in addition to\ntransforming it is dependent on what the needs of your organization are. In\nmany cases, transformation without conversion will suffice. Ultimately, data\ntransformation will help you move data into its target destination efficiently\nand effectively.\n\nMore and more businesses and organizations rely on data transformation to\nhandle the tremendous amounts of data being generated from emerging\ntechnologies and new applications. By being able to transform data,\norganizations not only maximize the value of their data but can manage their\ndata in simplistic ways and reduce the dreaded feeling of information\noverload.\n\n## Data Transformation Steps\n\nThere are five basic steps involved in data transformation that are important\nto know whether you are creating, implementing, or making use of the\ntransformation workflow. These steps are necessary to consider no matter how\nsimple or complex the data transformation will be. By following this rough\nguideline, you\u2019ll be able to properly plan and process the data to achieve\nyour data goals.\n\n### 1\\. Data Discovery and Data Profiling\n\n  * Interpret and make sense of the exact data you are working with (so you can turn what you have into what you want).\n  * Note the detailed information contained within the data such as the attributes, structure, and what it is you need to transform _knowing the file extension is not enough!_ )\n  * Here are some example questions you may ask yourself: \n    * _On structure:_ Is my data tabular, a raster (pixelated), or three dimensional?\n    * _On attributes:_ Is there additional metadata? What are the column headers describing? Is there any data missing?\n    * _On transformation:_ What units are measurements recorded in, and do I want to change them? Is all the data recorded in a consistent way?\n  * Identify if the data requires any cleaning before transformation.\n\n### 2\\. Data Mapping\n\n  * Establish a well thought out plan that identifies what elements of the data will be transformed and how that will happen.\n  * If you are transforming data for compatibility reasons (so your chosen applications can access data), determine what parts of the data should be changed and what needs to be left as is.\n  * Ensure that your plan considers whether or not data will be lost during transformation and how to mitigate losses if needed.\n\n### 3\\. Create a Workflow\n\n  * Decide if you will transform data by writing a script or by using a data transformation tool. Consider some of these questions: \n    * What is the current expertise on the team and are there any gaps to fill to successfully complete our data transformation project?\n    * Will the structure of my data and transformation requirements change over time? Will I be able to easily update the workflow to meet these changing needs?\n    * Do I need to consider if others will be using the workflow I create? Do I need to make it easy for others to understand in case I\u2019m not around?\n_FME is an example of an easy to use visual data transformation tool_\n\n  * Identify your input and output data file formats within your workflow. \n  * Identify the needs of the data transformation (compatibility, enriching, etc.) and ensure these requirements are met within your workflow.\n\n### 4\\. Run Your Workflow\n\n  * Connect the input data to your workflow and test what you\u2019ve created. When you run your workflow, it will rebuild the data to match your target format. The workflow is essentially a data restructuring process.\n  * Running the workflow should result in your old data being presented in a new way. Whether or not the data is converted into a new file format is up to you. For example: \n    * A JSON file with new keys and values added to each object\n    * A CSV file with dates updated to be recorded in a consistent way\n    * A Shapefile\u2019s attributes as a KML file with only key landmarks\n\n### 5\\. Review the Data\n\n  * Review the quality and accuracy of the output data.\n  * Create a list or audit of issues if necessary.\n  * Based on your findings, if needed, review the workflow you\u2019ve created, make changes, and try again.\n\n## Data Transformation with FME\n\nOne of the simplest ways to transform data is via data integration software\nplatforms like FME that specialize in data transformation. FME takes away the\nneed for writing scripts so anyone, no matter their technical background, can\neasily create and perform their own data transformation workflows.\n\nTransformers are FME\u2019s standard data transformation tools that are used to\nmodify data any way you\u2019d like. You can think of transformers as packaged\nactions, functions, or pre-written code snippets. There is a variety of\ntransformers for you to choose from, and you can add them to your workflow in\nany logical order that you\u2019d like so that data is transformed exactly for your\nneeds.\n\nIf you\u2019re a developer, no need to worry, FME isn\u2019t here to replace you. Just\nlike no single person can ever know everything, no single software will ever\nbe able to do everything. That\u2019s why you can insert your own pieces of code,\nsuch as Python, R or JavaScript, directly into a workflow so together you and\nFME can build something great. Now, instead of writing an entire data\ntransformation script you can create workflows quickly and simply, giving you\nmore time to work on more important tasks.\n\nOverall, whether you\u2019re a developer or not, FME\u2019s capabilities and built-in\ntransformers give you the flexibility and choice to customize and extend your\nworkflow however you want.\n\n### Here\u2019s How it Works\n\nTransformers are used directly in FME Form. It\u2019s easy for you to add\ntransformers to your workflow to create your own custom data transformation\nprocess. Here\u2019s how:\n\n  1. Add the transformer by typing its name anywhere within the workspace\n  2. Drag-and-drop your transformer where you want it\n  3. Connect transformers together using the input and output ports to link your workflow\n\nEach transformer has parameters that you have control over to give you the\nflexibility to transform data exactly how you want to. If you\u2019re new to data\ntransformation, not to worry. There\u2019s documentation to help you understand how\nthe parameters work. Before you know it, your new visual workflow will be\ncomplete!\n\nNow that you have a completed data transformation workflow, you can easily re-\nuse parts of or all of your workflow for additional data transformation tasks.\nTo make it easier for future you and others to understand your logic behind\nhow you created your original workflow, make use of the Annotations and\nBookmark features to add notes directly into your workspace.\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it! With your own creative skills and data expertise,\nworking with FME can get you where you need to go.\n\n_To learn more about the above data transformation, check out our tutorial\nonconverting CSV to Microsoft Excel._\n\n## What is FME?\n\nFME is recognized as the data integration platform with the best support for\nspatial data worldwide. However, it can handle much more than just spatial\ndata and is easily used by IT and business professionals. FME has a range of\nsupportive data transformation tools called transformers that make is easy to\nintegrate over 450 formats and applications. With FME you have the flexibility\nto transform and integrate exactly the way you want to.\n\nSafe Software, the makers of FME, are leaders in the technology world that\nstrive to stay one step ahead of data integration trends. FME is continuously\nupgraded to ensure it has been adapted to support new data formats, updated\nversions of existing data formats, and large amounts of data. Gone is the idea\nthat individual departments must work in their data silos, with IT structures\nlimiting the company\u2019s potential to truly work as one. Data should be able to\nflow freely no matter where, when, or how it\u2019s needed.\n\n**FME Form** **FME Flow** **FME Flow Hosted**\n\n## Related Resources\n\n**Getting Started With FME: Adding Transformers**\n\nright-arrow\n\n**How to Choose the Right Transformer**\n\nright-arrow\n\n**How to Develop for Data Transformation with FME Flow**\n\nright-arrow\n\n**What is Data Validation?**\n\nright-arrow\n\n**Why You Should Care About Spatial Data**\n\nright-arrow\n\n**What is Application Integration?**\n\nright-arrow\n\nProducts\n\n  * FME Platform\n  * Free Trial Downloads\n  * Customers\n  * Pricing\n  * Training\n  * Knowledge Base\n\nHelp\n\n  * Training\n  * Knowledge Base\n  * Forums\n  * Support\n\nCompany\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * Blog\n  * Forums\n  * Support\n\nSecondary Email\n\nPrimary Address\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list\n\nSend me updates from Safe Software (I can unsubscribe any time - privacy\npolicy)\n\nEmail Address*\n\nIndustry* Select an Industry AEC (Architecture Engineering and Construction)\nAirports & Aviation Commercial Defence/Aerospace Education/Non-Profit Energy\nGovernment (Federal) Government (Local) Government (State/Provincial)\nHealthcare/Health Tech Natural Resources Software/Technology\nTelecommunications Transportation Utilities Subscribe\n\nAn email is required.\n\nAn Industry is required.\n\n* * *\n\n\u00a9 2024 Safe Software Inc | Legal | Privacy Settings\n\n**Land Acknowledgement \u2014** Safe Software respectfully acknowledges that we\nlive, learn and work on the traditional and unceded territories of the\nKwantlen, Katzie, and Semiahmoo First Nations.\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your\ndevice to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our\nmarketing efforts.\n\nCookies Settings Reject All Accept All Cookies\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\n  * ### Your Privacy\n\n  * ### Strictly Necessary Cookies\n\n  * ### Performance Cookies\n\n  * ### Targeting Cookies\n\n  * ### Social Media Cookies\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your\nbrowser, mostly in the form of cookies.
