The initial three methods have\nbeen explained previously in this series.[1] Data transformation also forms\npart of initial preparation of data before statistical analysis.\n\nGo to:\n\n## WHEN TO DO TRANSFORMATION?\n\nThe pattern of values obtained when a variable is measured in large number of\nindividuals is called a distribution.[2] Distribution can be broadly\nclassified as normal and non-normal. The normal distribution is also called\n\u2018Gaussian distribution\u2019 as it was first described by K.F. Gauss. This is\ncalled normal distribution as most of the biological parameters (such as\nweight, height and blood sugar) follow it. There are a very few biological\nparameters which do not follow normal distribution, for example antibody\ntitre, number of episodes of diarrhoea, etc. The beginners should not be\nconfused with the term \u2018normal\u2019 as it does not necessarily imply clinical\nnormality and there is nothing abnormal in the \u2018non-normal\u2019 distributions.\n\nOne of the assumptions of the statistical test used for testing hypothesis is\nthat the data are samples from normal distribution.[3] Hence it becomes\nessential to identify skewed/normal distributions. There are some simple ways\nto detect skewness.[4]\n\n  * If the mean is less than twice the standard deviation, then the distribution is likely to be skewed.\n\n  * If the population follows normal distribution, then the mean and the standard deviation of the samples are independent. This fact can be used for detecting skewness. If the standard deviation increases as the mean increases across groups from a population, then it is a skewed distribution.\n\nApart from these simple methods, normality can be verified by statistical\ntests like Kolmogorov - Smirnov test.\n\nOnce skewness is identified, every attempt should be made to convert it into a\nnormal distribution, so that the robust parametric tests can be applied for\nanalysis. This can be accomplished by transformation.\n\nTransformations can also be done for the ease of comparison and\ninterpretation. The classical example of a variable which is always reported\nafter logarithmic transformation is the hydrogen ion concentration (pH).\nAnother example where transformation helps in the comparison of data is the\nlogarithmic transformation of dose-response curve. When the dose-response\nrelationship is plotted it is curvilinear. When the same response is plotted\nagainst log dose (log dose-response plot) it gives an elongated S-shaped\ncurve. The middle portion of this curve is a straight line and comparing two\nstraight lines (by measuring their slope) is easier than comparing two curves.\nHence transformation can assist in the comparison of data.\n\nIn a nutshell, transformation can be carried out to make the data follow\nnormal distribution or at times for ease of interpretation/comparison.\n\nGo to:\n\n## WHICH TYPE OF TRANSFORMATION TO USE?\n\nMany a times, the transformation which makes the distribution normal also\nmakes the variance equal. Even though there are many transformations like\nlogarithm, square root, reciprocal, cube root, square, the initial three are\nmore commonly used. The following are the guidelines for the selection of a\nmethod of transformation.[5]\n\n  * If the standard deviation is proportional to the mean, the distribution is positively skewed and logarithmic transformation is the ideal one.\n\n  * If the variance is proportional to the mean, square root transformation is preferred. This happens more in case of variables which are measured as counts e.g., number of malignant cells in a microscopic field, number of deaths from swine flu, etc.\n\n  * If the standard deviation is proportional to the mean squared, a reciprocal transformation can be performed. Reciprocal transformation is carried out for highly variable quantities such as serum creatinine.\n\nAmong these three transformations, logarithmic transformation is commonly used\nas it is meaningful on back transformation (antilog).[3,6]\n\n### Caution\n\nA small cautionary note for the beginners performing transformation is that\nall calculations should be done in the transformed scale and back\ntransformation should be done only at the end.\n\nMany researchers think that transformation of data is \u2018data deceiving\u2019. They\nare assured that transformation is a statistically approved method and it is\nuniversally valid.\n\nGo to:\n\n## HOW TO REPORT?\n\nWhile reporting the results, the summary statistics of the raw data should be\nmentioned. The transformation done should be clearly mentioned along with the\nreason for transformation. One should not forget to mention that all the\nstatistical analyses were carried out on the transformed data.[7] Finally the\nback transformation value (especially for 95% confidence interval) should also\nbe mentioned.\n\nGo to:\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n1\\.
