Home\n  2. Wikis\n  3. Data Transformation\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n## What Is Data Transformation?\n\nData transformation is a crucial process that involves converting data from\none format, structure, or type to another. This is necessary when data\nobtained from different sources is not in a standardized or compatible format,\nor when the target system or application requires a different data format or\nstructure. Data transformation is typically performed as part of the ETL\n(extract, transform, and load) process, which involves extracting data from\nsource systems, applying predefined rules and mappings to transform it, and\nloading it into target systems or data warehouses.\n\nData transformation involves a series of operations such as parsing,\nfiltering, sorting, aggregating, joining, splitting, and mapping. These\noperations manipulate the original data to produce a desired output that is\nconsistent, accurate, and usable for analytical or operational purposes. Data\ntransformation can be performed manually using scripting or automated using\nETL tools. They offer a visual interface and a library of connectors and\ncomponents that simplify the process of designing, executing, and monitoring\ndata transformation workflows.\n\n## How Is Data Transformation Used?\n\n**Data integration -** Data transformation integrates data from different\nsources into a single, unified format. For example, a retail company may need\nto integrate data from different point-of-sale systems in order to gain a\ncomprehensive view of its sales performance.\n\n**Data migration -** Data transformation is used to migrate data from one\nsystem to another, especially when moving to a new platform or database. For\nexample, a company may need to migrate data from an on-premises system to a\ncloud-based system.\n\n**Data cleansing -** Data transformation is used to clean and scrub data,\nremoving inconsistencies and errors affecting the analysis. For example, a\nfinancial institution may need to cleanse customer data to ensure compliance\nwith regulations.\n\n**Data warehousing -** Data transformation is used to prepare data for storage\nin a data warehouse, ensuring it is structured and formatted correctly. For\nexample, a healthcare organization may need to transform patient data from\ndifferent sources into a common format for storage in a data warehouse.\n\n**Data analytics -** Data transformation is used to prepare data for analysis,\nensuring it is in a format that can be easily queried and manipulated. For\nexample, a marketing team may need to transform customer data to create\ntargeted marketing campaigns based on demographics or behavior.\n\n## Challenges and Benefits of Data Transformation\n\n### Challenges\n\nOne of the main challenges of data transformation is ensuring data accuracy\nand consistency. As data is transformed from one format or structure to\nanother, there is a risk of data loss or corruption if the transformation is\nnot performed correctly.\n\nAnother challenge of data transformation is dealing with large volumes of\ndata. Transforming large datasets can be time-consuming and resource-\nintensive, and can require specialized tools and techniques. Data\ntransformation can also be complex and difficult to manage. Organizations need\nto have a clear understanding of their data and the goals of their\ntransformation process in order to ensure that the process is effective and\nefficient.\n\n### Benefits\n\nData transformation can help organizations to integrate and unify an\norganization\u2019s data from various sources and formats. This can lead to a more\ncomplete and accurate view of their data, which can drive better decision-\nmaking and insights. By transforming data into a more usable format,\norganizations can make their data more accessible to users and stakeholders.\nThis can enable faster and more informed decision-making across the\norganization.\n\nData transformation can also help organizations to optimize their data for\nanalytics and business intelligence. By transforming data into a format that\nis optimized for analysis, they can gain insights that drive business success\nand competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, data transformation is a critical process for organizations that want\nto unlock the full potential of their data. While it can present challenges,\nsuch as ensuring data accuracy and dealing with large volumes of data, the\nbenefits of data transformation, such as improved data integration,\naccessibility, and analytics, make it a worthwhile investment for\norganizations looking to drive growth and innovation.\n\n## Dremio and Data Transformation\n\nDremio's data transformation capabilities are made possible by its SQL-based\nquery engine, which allows users to manipulate data in real time. Users can\nperform a wide range of transformations on their data, such as filtering,\naggregating, joining, and pivoting, among others. These transformations can be\nperformed on data from various sources, including relational databases, NoSQL\ndatabases, cloud storage, and Hadoop-based data lakes.\n\nIn addition to these basic transformations, Dremio includes more advanced data\ntransformation capabilities, such as machine learning-based data profiling,\ndata cataloging, and automatic schema detection. These capabilities help to\nsimplify the process of data transformation and ensure that data is\ntransformed accurately and efficiently.\n\nOverall, data transformation is a crucial part of Dremio's data lake engine.\nBy providing powerful and flexible data transformation capabilities, Dremio\nallows users to extract maximum value from their data and gain insights that\ndrive business success.\n\n## Data Transformation Resources\n\n  * https://www.dremio.com/announcing-dremios-partnership-with-dbt-labs/\n  * https://docs.dremio.com/software/managing-data/data-curation/#transforming-data \n\n## Ready to Get Started?\n\nBring your users closer to the data with organization-wide self-service\nanalytics and lakehouse flexibility, scalability, and performance at a\nfraction of the cost.
