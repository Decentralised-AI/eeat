But is it\ntime for a data transformation yet?\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer, so let\u2019s explore a few things about data\ntransformation so you can answer this question for yourself.\n\nFirst off: companies need data to make informed decisions and improve their\nproducts and services. However, there\u2019s a catch: the quality of data collected\nhas to increase as the business grows.\n\nGood quality data has numerous benefits and opens countless opportunities for\nany business. It leads to better decision-making, improves productivity, and\nimproves marketing as communication and targeting become efficient.\n\nPoor data, on the other hand, leads to losses averaging $15 million a year for\norganizations. It undermines the confidence of decisions made. Research shows\nthat 84 percent of CEOs do not trust the quality of data they use to make\ndecisions.\n\nLack of confidence in data leads to a lack of confidence in results. Poor data\nalso leads to missed opportunities, lost revenue, and reputational damage.\n\nGood data is accurate, complete, and authoritative. The insights and\nconclusions one draws from data are only as good as the data collected.\n\n## **What Is Data Transformation?**\n\n_Data transformation involves converting data from one format to another._ The\ntransformation from its raw form to a format helps you know more about the\nbusiness, customers, and competitors.\n\nIn its raw form, data is inconsistent. It has both irrelevant and relevant\ndata. It may also contain information entered incorrectly or have some values\nmissing. Sometimes it contains duplicate data.\n\nIt\u2019s important to clean and transform the data to draw reliable business\ninsights that help the company innovate and improve processes. It\u2019s critical\nfor data management and integration since it helps standardize, shape, and\ncreate consistency in datasets.\n\nData transformation is also critical for businesses due to the rise of big\ndata. Businesses today use various applications, programs, and devices that\ncontinually amass loads of data.\n\nData compatibility becomes a risk as a result of all these disparate data\nsources. Data transformation allows companies to convert this data to a form\nthat can be stored, integrated, analyzed, and mined for intelligent insights.\n\nWith data transformation, organizations maximize the value of their data. It\nbecomes manageable in a simple way and prevents information overload.\n\nIt makes the data available in an accessible form. Data transformation can be\ncomplex or simple depending on the changes you need to occur before it\u2019s\naccessible in its final form.\n\nIt includes several activities like removing null or duplicate data,\nconverting data types, performing aggregations, and enriching data depending\non usage. The data transformation process can be done manually, automated, or\ncompleted by combining both methods.\n\n## **Why Transform Data?**\n\nCompanies carry out data transformation for many reasons, including for\ncomparison with other data sets. The data transformation allows the company to\nmake better-informed decisions based on data from different sources and not\njust one source.\n\nOther reasons why you may want to transform data include:\n\n  * Making it compatible with other data\n  * You need to move data to a new data store\n  * To join unstructured data with structured for combined analysis\n  * You want to enrich the data you have with additional information\n  * For aggregation: for example, comparing total sales from various regions\n\nData transformation allows you to compare data from different campaigns so\nthat you can improve processes and market your brand better.\n\nThe transformation, cleansing, standardizing,- and deduplicating of data is\nknown as data preparation. According to studies, most companies do it either\nfor analytics, financial reporting, business intelligence, or operations.\n\n_Image Source:Experian_\n\n## **The Data Transformation Process**\n\nThe reason you carry out data transformation is to extract data, convert it to\na form you can use, and then deliver it. The process is known as ETL. Extract,\nTransform, Load. Extraction involves identifying data and pulling it from\ndifferent sources or locations into one repository.\n\n_Image Source:Tatvasoft (The ETL Process)_\n\nThe extracted data is raw and cannot give comprehensive information in this\nform. It needs transformation so that you can mine it for intelligence.\n\nSometimes, before the transformation, data needs to be cleansed. Cleansing it\ninvolves fixing missing values, resolving inconsistencies, and getting rid of\nduplicate data.\n\nOnce cleansed, transform your data using the following steps:\n\n### **1\\. Data Discovery**\n\nThis first step involves determining the kind of data you have and to what\nversion you need it transformed. To accurately interpret data, you need a tool\nthat looks at what is inside a file and not just the name.\n\nMost applications and operating systems will interpret data based on the\nextension of the file name. For example, a file could have the extension\ntext.doc for Microsoft Word, but in actual sense, the actual data inside the\nfile is not a Word document. Users can give files different extensions, and\nchanging the extension will not transform this data.\n\nYou also need to choose the target format your data will appear in after\ntransformation. It\u2019s good to find out from the system or tool you plan to send\nyour data, to what formats it expects or supports.\n\nDiscovery leads to visualization. Users can now see connections between\nvariables to determine what needs analyzing.\n\n### **2\\. Data Mapping and Profiling**\n\nDuring data mapping, you plan the actual transformation. It\u2019s a road map for\nthe migration process. At this stage, you plan how the merging, storage, and\ntransformation will occur.\n\nData mapping prevents you from having issues with the data later. It\nneutralizes mismatches and errors, standardizes the process, and makes it easy\nto understand the data destination. Data mapping ensures quality data, which\nenables effective analysis.\n\nIf the transformation is for compatibility reasons, determine which data needs\nto be transformed and which one should remain as is. It\u2019s also a good time to\nconsider how you will handle data loss and how to mitigate against such a\nloss. It keeps you on your toes so that you are alert to any mistakes during\nthe transformation process.  \n\nData profiling examines data from the source to determine completeness,\naccuracy, and validity. When combined with an ETL process, it cleanses and\nenriches data. It ensures that data moved to the target location is of high\nquality and accurate.\n\nIt helps identify data quality issues that need handling when you move data to\nthe new location. Identify issues of data quality that need fixing in the\nsource and which data quality problems to fix during transformation.\n\nDuring data profiling, you can find out if:\n\n  * The data is complete. Do you have blank values?\n  * Is it unique or duplicated? Research carried out by Integrate found that duplicate data is one of the most prevalent issues affecting the quality of leads in small and medium enterprises, enterprise businesses, and media companies.\n\n_Image Source:Integrate_\n\n  * Does your data have anomalous patterns? Are there patterns in the distribution of data?\n  * Are these the patterns you want?\n  * Is the existing range of values what you expected?\n\nAnswering these questions will ensure you maintain quality data essential for\nyour business to thrive. Fail to do this, and you will transfer bad data that\nwill later cost you 100 dollars per dirty record. Also, your team will spend\nextra time cleaning data on both records.\n\n**Want fewer dirty records? Better data that fuels decision-making?Join\nSyncApps and say goodbye to the biggest source of dirty data: manual\ntransfers. Let automation transfer, sort, and systematize your data while you\nhandle strategy!**\n\nYou can profile data in three ways:\n\n#### **_a)_** ** _Structure Discovery_**\n\nThis profiling helps you check how data is structured. It confirms that data\nis formatted right and consistent. It also helps you understand the format of\nfields. For example, you can use pattern matching to find out if phone numbers\nare valid or find out if records should be text or number-based.\n\nFinding data structure also helps you analyze the range. You can determine the\nmaximum and minimum values, means, modes, medians, or standard deviations for\nattributes. Validating the consistency of data ensures the processing of\nqueries is efficient at the final location.\n\n#### _b)_ **_Content Discovery_**\n\nClosely examine individual elements in each database. It will help you find\nambiguous, incorrect, or null values. Content discovery fixes these issues.\n\nFor example, by correctly inputting street addresses in the right format.\nProblems that arise from non-standard data include sending packages to the\nwrong address or calling the wrong phone number.\n\n#### _**c)** _**_Relationship Discovery_**\n\nRelationship discovery gives us a better understanding of the data in use and\nthe connections between data sets. It determines relationships between data\nand narrows down the connections to specific fields, especially if data\noverlaps.\n\nIt helps identify redundant data and those that one can map together. For\nexample, data that can help increase upselling opportunities.\n\nFinally, validate data to ensure that data instances and data sets agree with\npredetermined rules.\n\n### **3\\. Transform Your Data**\n\nAt this stage, consider how you will transform your data. Will you use a\nwritten script or a data transformation tool? The choice will depend on\nwhether you have experts in your team, and whether you have the infrastructure\nresources.\n\nExtract data from different sources and perform your data transformation in\ndifferent ways, including:\n\n  * **Aggregating:** link or fuse data from different sources.\n  * **Filtering** : selectively isolates individual rows and columns. Here you retain some records and remove some from an existing database.\n  * **Enriching** : changing the format of valuables. For example, from lower case to Capitalised fonts for names: From jane doe to Jane Doe.\n  * **Splitting:** divide columns into multiple columns.\n  * **Summarization:** summarize the values and store them as business metrics. For example, total downloads by socioeconomic status, gender, and or location.\n  * **Derivation** : use existing data to create new data elements either using logic or mathematical transformations.\n  * **Binning** : helps reduce the effects of minor errors from observation.  We replace the original numbers represented in a small interval (bin), with values that are representative of large intervals \u2014 for example, arranging the ages of consumers into smaller age intervals. You can group every five years, like 11 \u2013 15, 16-20.\n  * **Removing duplicate data**\n\nWhen transforming the data, consider whether the structure of the data will\nchange over time and if you can easily update to meet changing needs. Make it\neasy for others to understand too so that they can use it even when you are\nnot around.\n\n### **4\\. Send to Target Location and Review**\n\nAfter transforming, send the data to the target location. Ensure you get the\nresults you were hoping for so that your old data is presented in a new way\nand converted to a new format.\n\nReview the data to ensure accuracy and quality. If there are issues, make a\nlist and then correct where necessary.\n\n## **Data Transformation Challenges**\n\nData-driven marketing is the key to succeeding in today\u2019s market, but most\ncompanies have yet to adopt it. According to research, only 31 percent of\norganizations are data-driven.\n\nSeventy-one percent of companies have yet to start a data culture, 53.1\npercent of companies are not treating data as an asset, and 52.4 percent are\nnot competing on analytics and data.\n\nImage Source: New Vantage Partners\n\nDuring transformation, companies encounter several challenges, including:\n\n### _a)_ **_Data Quality_**\n\nThe quality of data from one source can become skewed during moving. Data\nmoved is either combined wrongly or gets lost. In this case, customers with\nthe same names can get their data combined or mixed.\n\nWhen this happens, confusion happens since two different customers have\ndifferent interests, likes, and needs. The marketing team sends the customers\nthe wrong messages, and the sales team sends the wrong offers.\n\nThe result is poor customer experience and wasted time. Other times, the lack\nof a unique identifier when linking data leads to problems later.\n\n### _b)_ **_Talent Gap_**\n\nTransforming data requires infrastructure and a team of experts to ensure\nsuccess. The ability to complete a seamless transformation will require tools\nand knowledge on how to handle the process and deal with problems that arise.\n\nMost companies do not have the right expertise and rely on 3rd party companies\nto handle the transformations.\n\n### _c)_ **_Wasted Time_**\n\nData preparation and migration is time-consuming and takes up almost two-\nthirds of data scientists\u2019 time.\n\n_Image Source:Crowd Flower_\n\n### _d)_ **_Lack of Proper Tools_**\n\nIn a study by Forbes, 23 percent of those surveyed were still using\nspreadsheets for data work. Seventeen percent were using dashboards, 19\npercent had no analytical tools, and only 41 percent had advanced analytical\ntools and forecasting techniques.\n\nWithout the proper tools, the transformation will not happen effectively, and\nit will become a challenging task.\n\n### **_e)_**   **_Cost_**\n\nDepending on the infrastructure and expertise you have, you may incur\nadditional cost during the period of the transformation process.\n\n## **How to Transform Your Data**\n\nThe different ways to transform data include:\n\n**Scripting** : You can hire python developers to use scripts like Python or\nSQL to write code to transform data. However, hand-coding increases error\nopportunities and may not be replicable. You may be required to rewrite the\ncode each time you need to transform data resulting in high costs. This\nmodification emphasizes the importance of hiring Python developers for\nefficient and cost-effective data transformation.\n\n**On-premise ETL tools** : these automate the process making it easy to\ntransform data. You host the tools on your site, and this may require\ninfrastructure cost and extensive expertise.\n\n**Cloud-based ETL tools:** you host the ETL tools in the cloud. This option\nallows you to leverage the vendor\u2019s infrastructure and expertise.\n\n## **Benefits of Data Transformation**\n\nGood data helps increase efficiency leading to increased revenues. By using\ndata transformation, companies reap the following benefits:\n\n  * **_High data quality to make informed decisions_**. The cost of using bad data is high. This is why organizations need access to quality data, especially when making decisions. Transforming data reduces and eliminates quality issues, including missing values and inconsistencies.\n  * **_Faster retrieval time_**. Data is stored in one location after standardization, making it easy to retrieve.\n  * **_Effective data management_** : As your marketing efforts evolve, you generate data from different sources, and this can lead to inconsistencies. However, with transformation, data is refined, organized, and made easier to understand. Fewer resources are also needed to manipulate the data needed.\n  * **_More usable data to analyze and for business intelligence_**. According to Forester, most companies do not analyze data for business intelligence.  Data transformation tools allow your company to improve the accessibility of data, standardize it, and use it for intelligence.\n  * **_Better management and organization of data_**\n\n## **Data Transformation Best Practices**\n\n### **1\\. Have a Target in Mind**\n\nBefore you can jump into the transformation, decide on a target location.\nEngage the users too so that you can understand the processes to analyze.\n\nThey feel engaged in the process and have a sense of ownership of the results.\nKnowing the target location and what you are analyzing beforehand helps you\nidentify only the needed data during transformation.\n\n### **2\\. Data Profile First**\n\nBefore transforming, profile your data to understand in what state your raw\ndata is available. It also shows you the amount of work needed to make it\nready for the transformation.\n\nKnowing before transforming gives you a heads up on the amount of data you\nwill be working with, the data type, column heads, range of values, column\nrelationships, number of rows, frequency of junk, and missing and duplicate\ndata.\n\n### **3\\. Cleanse Data Before Transforming**\n\nAfter data profiling, cleanse your data before moving it to make it usable.\nThe process will require you to know what kind of format your target\ndestination accepts so that you make the necessary changes.\n\nFor example, if the current date format is DD-MM-YYYY and your target field\nformat is YYYY/DD/MM. You will need to change the source data to match the\ntarget format. In case of missing or junk data, consult others in the team\nabout filling in the blanks or excluding the records.\n\nWhen you cleanse data early, your final data will be of high quality and help\nbetter confident decisions. According to a study by KPMG, 56 percent of\nexecutives are concerned about their data integrity. If they don\u2019t trust the\ndata, then they don\u2019t use it to make decisions.\n\nImage source: KPMG\n\n_Image source:_ _KPMG_\n\n### **4\\. Change the Data to the Target Format**\n\nWhen you change data to the target location format, you break down silos that\nwould complicate the data analysis process. Multiple data need time to merge\nto gain meaningful insights.\n\nConformed data requires less processing and analysts get more time to handle\nother issues.\n\n### **5\\. How to Treat Dimension Tables and Fact Tables**\n\nTransformed data results into two tables: dimension tables and fact tables.\n\nDimension tables include data on the \u201c _who, what, when, how, where, and how\u201d_\ncontext. They can be products, customers, and dates.\n\nFact tables are the results of events to be measured and answer questions like\n\u201c _How many_? They include transaction records, measures, and sales results.\n\nWhen transforming, load dimensions first so that you can easily link them to\nthe facts. For example, load customers, products, and dates first then link\nthem to sales data.\n\n### **6\\. Track Audit and Test Data Quality**\n\nTracking audit helps you capture records you load during each step and the\ntime it happened. Quality tests ensure you have no duplicate or null data, and\nthat the structure is correct.\n\nDoing this ensures that you can tell where each piece of data came from later\nwhen one of the stakeholders has a question. It also verifies that the metrics\nare right. Having correct data backed by evidence builds confidence in the\ndata and improves engagement with the end-users.\n\n### **7\\. Continually Engage End-Users**\n\nThe value of data transformed is viable to the extent that the end-user is\nusing it continuously. Run regular tests on the data to help address any\ndefects and updates.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWith growing data amounts, marketers are finding it imperative to transform\ndata quickly. Only companies that invest in the right data can remain\ncompetitive. Data transformation allows your company to clean out the large\npool of data and turn it into useful data analyzed for actionable insights.\n\nWith the right data and the right tools in place, you can establish close\nrelationships with customers and provide them with great experiences. You just\nneed to have the right data at the right time about the right customer.\n\nThis way, you can make them feel special by providing personalized\nexperiences. If you use the wrong data to target customers, then they will\nseek out your competitors for better experiences.\n\nIf you\u2019re running campaigns with the wrong data, your conversion rates will\nalso suffer. Your sales team will be working with the wrong data and chasing\nthe wrong leads or recommending the wrong products. Not transforming fast\nenough will also make you late to deliver what your customers want at the\nright time.\n\nHaving good data transforms and speeds up your processes. It makes your\nemployees more productive and improves decision-making. It will also make it\neasy to access up-to-date data leading to maximum usage of data to meet\ncustomer needs and achieve your bottom line.\n\n* * *\n\n**Angie** manages Cazoomi's Operations.
