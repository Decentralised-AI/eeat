The continuous increase in the volume of data is\na potential gold mine for businesses. Like gold, data has to be carefully\nmined and refined, or in this case, extracted and transformed to get the most\nvalue.\n\nBusinesses receive tremendous volumes of data from various sources to make\nbetter decisions. But raw data can be complex, challenging, and almost\nmeaningless to the decision-makers in an organization. By transforming data,\nbusinesses can fully maximize the value of their data and use it to make more\nin-depth strategic decisions.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll share an overview of data transformation, how it works,\nits benefits and challenges, and different data transformation approaches\n\n  1. What is Data Transformation?\n  2. Why Transform Data?\n  3. How Data Transformation Works\n  4. Data Transformation Methods\n  5. Data Transformation Use Cases\n  6. Data Transformation Challenges\n  7. Data Transformation Best Practices\n  8. Use Data Transformation Tools Over Custom Coding\n\n## **What is Data Transformation?**\n\nData transformation is the process of converting data from a complex form to a\nmore straightforward, usable format. It can involve actions ranging from\ncleaning out data, changing data types, deleting duplicate data, data\nintegration, and data replication, depending on the desired result.\n\nData transformation is an integral part of any data pipeline including ETL\n(Extract, Transform, and Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines.\nETL involves **extracting** data from multiple sources, **transforming** it\ninto a more intelligent structure, and **loading** or storing it in a data\nwarehouse. In contrast, ELT shifts the bulk of the transformations to the\ndestination data warehouse.\n\nData transformation is essential to standardize data quality across an\norganization and create consistency in the type of data shared between systems\nin the organization.\n\n## **Why Transform Data? (Benefits)**\n\nWith data transformation, businesses can increase efficiencies, make better\ndecisions, generate more revenue, and gain many other benefits, including:\n\n  * **Higher data quality:** Businesses are very concerned with data quality because it is crucial for making accurate decisions. Data transformation activities like removing duplicate data and deleting null values can reduce inconsistencies and improve data quality.\n  * **Improved data management:** Organizations rely on data transformation to handle the tremendous amounts of data generated from emerging technologies and new applications. By transforming data, organizations can simplify their data management and reduce the dreaded feeling of information overload.\n  * **Seamless data integration:** It is normal for a business to run on more than one technology or software system. Some of these systems need to transfer data between one another. With data transformation, the data sent can be converted into a usable format for the receiving system, making data integration a seamless process.\n  * **Obfuscate sensitive data** : In order to abide by GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations, companies need to be able to mask or remove sensitive information such as PII or credit card numbers when transferring data from one system to another.\n\n_An example showing how Striim can be used to mask credit card numbers during\ndata transfer from one system to another._\n\n## **How Data Transformation Works**\n\nWhen data is extracted from the source, it is raw and nearly impossible to\nuse. The data transformation process involves identifying the data,\nstructuring it, and generating a workflow that can be executed to convert the\ndata. Sometimes, it is mandatory to clean the data first for easy\nidentification and mapping.\n\nThe steps to transform raw data into an intelligent format include:\n\n  1. **Identify the data:** This is the data discovery phase, and it involves identifying and understanding the data in its source/extracted format. Data discovery is usually best accomplished with the help of a data profiling tool. Here, you have an idea of what should be done to get the data into the desired format.\n  2. **Structure the data:** This is the data mapping stage where the actual transformation process is planned. Here, you define how the fields in the data are connected and the type of transformation they will need. This stage is also where you consider if there would be any loss of data in the transformation process. For example, if we have a simple Excel spreadsheet with a date column in an incorrect format, we would want to make a \u2018mapping\u2019 to determine the type of transformation needed to change the date to a correct format.\n  3. **Generate a workflow:** For transformation to occur, a workflow or code needs to be generated. You can write your custom code or use a data transformation tool. Python and R are the most common languages for a custom code, but it can be done in any language, including an Excel Macro, depending on the transformation needs. When developing a transformation workflow, consider certain factors like scalability (will the transformation needs change over time?) and usability (will other people need this workflow?).\n  4. **Execute the workflow:** Here, data is restructured and converted to the desired format.\n  5. **Verify the data:** After transformation, it is best to check if the output is in the expected format. If it isn\u2019t, review the generated workflow, make necessary changes, and try again.\n\n## **Data Transformation Methods**\n\nOrganizations can transform data in different ways to better understand their\noperations. For example, data aggregation, data filtering, data integration,\netc., are all forms of data transformation, and they can happen with any of\nthese types of data transformation:\n\n### **Transformation with scripting**\n\nThis type of transformation involves manually coding the data transformation\nprocess from start to finish in Python, R, SQL, or any other language. It is\nan excellent approach for customization but often results in unintentional\nerrors and misunderstandings as developers sometimes fail to interpret the\nexact requirements in their custom-coded solutions.\n\n### **Transformation with on-site ETL tools**\n\nThese tools work through on-site servers to extract, transform, and load\ninformation into an on-site data warehouse. However, an on-site transformation\nsolution can be expensive to set up and manage as data volume increases, so\nbig data companies have moved to more advanced cloud-based ETL tools.\n\n### **Transformation with cloud-based ETL tools**\n\nCloud-based ETL tools have simplified the process of data transformation.\nInstead of working on an on-site server, they work through the cloud. In\naddition, these tools make it easier to link cloud-based platforms with any\ncloud-based data warehouse.\n\n### **Transformations within a data warehouse**\n\n**Instead of ETL (where data is transformed before it\u2019s loaded into a\ndestination) ELT shifts the transformations to the data warehouse. dbt (data\nbuild tool) is a popular development framework that empowers data analysts to\ntransform data using familiar SQL statements in their data warehouse of\nchoice.**\n\n## **Data Transformation Use Cases**\n\n**Data Preparation and Cleaning for ELT Pipelines**\n\nIn ELT, users load data into the data warehouse in its raw form and apply\ntransformations in the DW layer using stored procedures and tools like dbt.\nHowever the raw data can have many issues preventing it from being actionable.\n\nData Transformation can address the following issues:\n\n  * The raw data may have lookup IDs instead of human readable names, for example like this:\n\n**User ID** | **Page Viewed** | **Timestamp**  \n---|---|---  \n12309841234 | Homepage | 3:00 pm UTC July 30,2021  \n12309841235 | Request a demo | 4:00 pm UTC July 30,2021  \n  \nInstead of this:\n\n**Username** | **Page Viewed** | **Timestamp**  \n---|---|---  \nJane Strome | Homepage | 3:00 pm UTC July 30,2021  \nJohn Smith | Request a demo | 4:00 pm UTC July 30,2021  \n  \n  * De-duplication of redundant records\n  * Removing null or invalid records that would break reporting queries\n  * Transforming your data to fit machine learning training models\n\n**Business Data Transformations for Operational Analytics**\n\nBusiness and analytical groups may have some north star metrics that can only\nbe tracked by correlating multiple data sets. Data transformation jobs can\njoin data across multiple data sets and aggregate it to create a unified view\nof this data. Examples of this include:\n\n  * **Joining unique customer records across multiple tables** \u2013 your customer Jane Smith exists in your CRM, your support ticketing system, your website analytics system (e.g. Google Analytics), and your invoicing system. You can write a transform to create a unified view of all her sales and marketing touchpoints and support tickets to get a 360 view of her customer activity.\n\n  * **Creating aggregate values from raw data** \u2013 for instance you can take all your invoices and transform them to build a table of monthly revenue categorized by location or industry\n  * **Creating analytical tables** \u2013 it may be possible for your data analyst to write complex queries to get answers to simple questions. Alternatively your data engineering team can make life easy for data analysts by pre-creating analytical tables. That will make your analysts\u2019 job as easy as writing a \u2018select * from x limit 100\u2019 to generate a new report and drive down compute costs in your warehouse. For example:\n\nSales Data Table:\n\n**Customer** | **Invoice Amount** | **Invoice Date**  \n---|---|---  \nACME | $100 | 3:00 pm UTC July 30,2021  \nMyShop | $200 | 1:00 pm UTC July 29, 2021  \n  \nAnd Monthly Sales (analytical table):\n\n**Month** | **Invoice Amount**  \n---|---  \nJuly | $500  \nAugust | $200  \n  \n## **Data Transformation Challenges**\n\nData transformation has many benefits to an organization, but it is also\nimportant to note that certain hurdles make data transformation difficult.\n\nData transformation can be a costly process. ETL tools come at a price, and\ntraining staff on data management processes is not exactly a walk in the park\neither. The cost of data transformation depends on infrastructure size.\nExtensive infrastructure will require hiring a team of data experts to oversee\nthe transformation process.\n\nTo transform data effectively, an organization would have to set up tools,\ntrain its current employees, and/or hire a new set of experts to oversee the\nprocess. Either way, it is going to cost time and resources to make that\nhappen.\n\n## **Data Transformation Best Practices**\n\nThe data transformation process seems like an easy step-by-step workflow, but\nthere are certain things to keep in mind to avoid running into blockers or\ncarrying out the wrong type of data transformation. The following are data\ntransformation best practices:\n\n  * **Start by designing the target format.** Jumping right into the nitty-gritty of data transformation without understanding the end goal is not a good idea. Communicate with business users to understand the process you are trying to analyze and design the target format before transforming data into insights.\n  * **Profile the data**. In other words, get to know the data in its native form before converting it. It helps to understand the state of the raw data and the type of transformation required. Data profiling enables you to know the amount of work required and the workflow to generate for transformation.\n  * **Cleanse before transforming**. Data cleaning is an essential pre-transformation step. It reduces the risk of having errors in the transformed data. Data can have missing values or information that is irrelevant to the desired format. By cleansing your data first, it increases the accuracy of the transformed data.\n  * **Audit the data transformation process.** At every stage of the transformation process, track the data and changes that occur. Auditing the data transformation process makes it easier to identify the problem source if complications arise.\n\n## **Use Data Transformation Tools Over Custom Coding**\n\nData transformation tools are more cost-effective and more efficient than\ncustom coding. Writing codes for data transformation functions have a higher\nrisk of inefficiencies, human error, and excessive use of time and resources.\n\n_Striim is a data integration solution that offers real-time, high-speed SQL-\nbased transformations_.\n\nData transformation tools are usually designed to execute the entire ETL\nprocess. If you are not using tools for the transformation process, you\u2019ll\nalso need to worry about the \u201cextraction\u201d and \u201cloading\u201d steps. Custom coding\nallows for a fully customized data transformation solution, but as data\nsources, volumes, and other complexities increase, scaling and managing this\nbecomes increasingly difficult.\n\nStriim is an end-to-end data integration solution that offers scalable in-\nmemory transformations, enrichment and analysis, using high-speed SQL queries.\nTo get a personalized walkthrough of Striim\u2019s real-time data transformation\ncapabilities, please request a demo.
