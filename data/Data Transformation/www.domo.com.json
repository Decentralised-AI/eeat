Through a\nprocess called normalization, data is transformed to reduce data redundancy\nand improve data integrity.\n\nIn this article, we will talk about why data transformation is so important\nfor your business, the different types of data transformation, and how you can\nreadily apply these principles to transform your business.\n\n  \n\n### **Why is data transformation important?**\n\nData needs to be in a consistent format in order to be useful for a business.\nSay, for example, your point of sale system uses numbers for different product\nSKUs. When transactions are being processed through the system, you would\nexpect each SKU to be scanned and identified by a unique number. If the system\nforgets to input a number or adds additional letters to the SKU, this could\ndamage the system and make it unreliable.\n\nData transformation helps solve common data issues that occur in business\nprocesses. Since businesses are constantly evolving and changing, their\nprocesses are often imperfect, causing their data to become imperfect. Data\ntransformation is an intermediary step to help ensure clean and accurate data.\n\n### **Different types of data transformation**\n\nData transformation comes in a variety of forms. It\u2019s important to understand\neach type of transformation, when it should be used, and why it is important.\nThe main forms of data transformation are:\n\n#### **Data cleansing**\n\nData cleansing is a transformation type used to ensure the integrity of the\ndata. Validation rules can be put in place to ensure data is in a consistent\nformat that is human-readable and ready for processing.\n\nOftentimes, data from source systems can be extremely messy. For example, a\ndate field may be stored as a floating decimal computer format, making it\ndifficult to interpret. Data cleaning can help remedy this by performing an\noperation to convert the field to a standard date format.\n\n#### **Aggregation**\n\nAggregation is an extremely common data transformation technique that involves\nsummarizing the data to create a new view of it. Many data sources can have\nhundreds of millions of rows and columns, which can make it quite confusing\nfor the end-user. Aggregating the data allows you to reduce its size and\ncomplexity of it.\n\nCommon aggregations include finding the sum, average, minimum, maximum, or\ntotal count of the data. An example of using an aggregation could be counting\nthe number of open opportunities in the pipeline for your sales team. This\nprovides a high-level overview of the sales organization. Aggregations can be\nextremely valuable in creating summary numbers for dashboards and reports.\n\n#### **Joining data**\n\nJoining data involves combining information from different data sources or\ndata tables together. This creates a unified view of the data that can be used\nfor further analysis. Data that is stored in databases usually require joins\nin order to present the data in a format that will be useful to the business.\n\nData joins are critical for any organization that wants to make better use of\nits data. Since data lives in so many different parts of the business, joins\ncan be used to combine data and extract insights that otherwise would not have\nbeen possible. An example of this is joining sales CRM data to billing data\nfrom an accounting system. This creates a more unified view of the customer\nthat can be distributed and used by different departments within the\norganization.\n\n#### **Appending data**\n\nAppending data is another process used to combine data that is stored in\nsimilar formats. When new data occurs in a system, it can be added \u2014 or\nappended \u2014 at the bottom of the dataset. That data then becomes part of the\ntable, as it shares similar characteristics to the data above it.\n\nData appending is an important data transformation process to maintain the\nstability and data integrity of source systems. It can also be used to add\ndata from different sources together for analysis. An example of this is a\ncorporation that operates in different countries and uses different systems of\nrecord for inventory. Since data is not natively stored together, it can be\nappended afterward as a data transformation.\n\n  \n\n### **How can I automate data transformation?**\n\nData transformation is critical to maintaining the data infrastructure of your\nbusiness. It\u2019s also a continuous process that can require large amounts of\nmanual effort if not handled properly. Luckily, modern business intelligence\n(BI) tools help with the automation of data transformation.\n\nBI tools can create automated data pipelines that are constantly performing\ndata transformation steps. Using pre-built data connectors, they are able to\nhook into software and business systems that you are already using and perform\ndata transformation steps such as the ones we\u2019ve outlined above. Automation is\na powerful capability that modern BI tools possess, saving your company time\nand resources.\n\n### **Using a BI tool for data transformation**\n\nNow that we understand the importance of data transformation in modern\nbusiness, it\u2019s important to partner with a BI vendor that possesses the\ncapabilities and expertise when it comes to data transformation. Not all BI\nvendors are alike in this aspect, as many focus solely on end visualizations\nand dashboards.\n\nBI tools are very easy to get started with because they are built with the\nend-user in mind. Business users of all types can get up and running with a BI\ntool in a matter of minutes\u2014not days. They also do not require the expertise\nof IT teams to run, which saves you time and money.\n\nThe best BI tools also offer a wide range of data transformation steps that\nare pre-built and ready for use. If you need to customize according to the\nunique needs of your business, there are also tools that can guide you through\ntransforming your data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nData transformation is a critical step to extracting the most insights as\npossible out of your business data. Companies that effectively use their data\nare more competitive in today\u2019s marketplace and continue to innovate and\ndelight their customers. By adopting a BI tool to automate the data\ntransformation steps within your organization, you can continue to focus on\nthe most critical aspects of your business.\n\nETL Tools\n\n#### RELATED RESOURCES\n\nReport\n\n#### Cloud Data Integration for Analytics\n\nLearn More\n\nReport\n\n#### Domo Tops Dresner\u2019s List of Cloud BI Vendors in 2022\n\nLearn More\n\nReport\n\n#### Closing the Data Decision Gap\n\nLearn More\n\nblog\n\n#### Key takeaways from a new study on data\u2019s role in decisions\n\nLearn More\n\n### Ready to get started?  \nTry Domo now or watch a demo.\n\nTry Free\n\nWatch Demo\n\n#### PRODUCT\n\n  * Overview\n  * Business Intelligence\n  * Data Integration\n  * Business Apps\n  * Embedded Analytics\n  * Governance\n  * Security & Compliance\n  * All Features\n  * New Releases\n  * Pricing\n\n#### SOLUTIONS\n\n  * Domo for Enterprise\n  * Domo for Business\n  * Domo for AWS\n  * Domo for Snowflake\n  * By Roles\n  * By Industry\n  * Apps & Integrations\n\n#### RESOURCES\n\n  * Try Free\n  * Watch Demo\n  * Talk to Sales\n  * Resource Library\n  * Blog\n  * Events\n  * Domopalooza\n  * Charts\n  * Glossary\n\n#### DOMO CENTRAL\n\n  * Domo Central Overview\n  * Community\n  * Help\n  * Knowledge Base\n  * Training\n  * Docs & APIs\n  * Support and Services\n\n#### COMPANY\n\n  * Overview\n  * Why Domo\n  * Customers\n  * Partners\n  * Leadership\n  * News & Media\n  * Careers\n  * Domo for Good\n  * Investor Relations\n  * Contact Us\n\nEnglish\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 \u2014 2024 Domo, Inc.  \nDomo Cookies  |  Privacy Notice | Patents | CA Do Not Sell or Share My\nPersonal Information\n\n",
