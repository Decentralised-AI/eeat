But how can you make customers, rivals, and business\ninformation easily accessible to everyone in your organization? The solution\nis data transformation.\n\n## What is Data Transformation?\n\nData transformation is the process of converting, structuring, and cleansing\nraw data from one format to another to make it ready for analytics and\nconsumption. It is a critical part of the data integration process and\nconsists of multiple steps, such as filtering your data based on specific\nrules and joining different fields to get a consolidated view of all your\ndata.\n\nThe ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process extracts raw data from a source,\nconverts it into a usable format, and sends it to a target system. Raw data is\nunusable in its original form, so you must transform it to use it.\n\nMost ETL tools also provide predefined functions that you can use to change\nyour data quickly and efficiently. Here are some of the steps that are\ninvolved in this process:\n\n  * Identify the structure of the source files and extract data from them.\n  * Next, map the data from the source file to the transformation tool.\n  * Apply the transformation (i.e., filter, sort, cleanse, or aggregate data).\n  * Finally, send the transformed file to the destination.\n\n## Benefits of Data Transformation\n\nData serves various purposes for organizations and businesses, from analyzing\nsupply chains, customer behaviors, and internal processes to creating\nautomated data-driven workflows. However, for these purposes, it must be in a\nusable format, and data transformation ensures that data achieves this\nusability, resulting in the following benefits:\n\n  * **Gaining maximum value from data** : Most organizations are unable to gain maximum value from data due to factors such as volume, complexity, quality, and lack of tools and skills. Forrester reports that organizations never analyze up to 73% of all data. Data transformation is a process that can help them overcome these challenges by changing the structure and format of raw data to make it more suitable for analysis. This improves data quality and facilitates analysis, enabling them to leverage more effectively in decision making.\n  * **Standardizing data** : Data coming from multiple sources may be inconsistent, making it difficult to use in analytics. Data transformation helps you standardize data.\n  * **Improved accuracy and compliance:** Transformed data undergoes cleansing, validation, and enrichment, improving its consistency and reliability. The improved data quality makes it easier to ensure regulatory compliance.\n  * **Performing faster queries** : Transforming data allows you to store it in a standardized format. Standard formats enable faster queries, making it easier to retrieve data quickly.\n  * **Enhancing data quality** : Transforming data can help you eliminate data quality issues such as missing, inconsistent, duplicate, or invalid values. As a result, you can avoid costs and risk associated with poor data quality.\n\n## How Data Transformation Works\n\nThe goal of data transformation is straightforward \u2013 extract data from the\nsource, change it to a usable format and load it to a destination. It is an\nessential part of ETL pipelines.\n\nData transformation allows you to clean, reshape, and compute new data\ndimensions and metrics based on your needs. Traditionally, it takes anywhere\nfrom hundreds to thousands of lines of code to build ETL or ELT pipelines.\nHowever, with a no-code ETL tool, you can easily build these pipelines on a\nvisual canvas, known as a dataflow.\n\n  1. **Identify sources:** First, you must identify data sources you must transform. Those sources can be databases, Excel, delimited files, legacy sources, or even cloud connectors. Some data extraction tools also allow you to extract data from unstructured files such as PDFs.\n  2. **Data mapping** **:** In this phase, the actual transformation is planned. You must decide where the data is sourced and where it will be saved. The goal is to change the source data to a format suitable to the destination. For instance, data from source files in XML or Excel format needs to be transformed into SQL format. To make the format suitable for analytics, you may have to perform several operations, such as adding, deleting, copying, and replicating fields and records.\n  3. **Choose Transformation:** Here, you choose the relevant transformation that fits with your planned data mapping and put the data transformation process into motion, converting the data into the desired output. Here are a few transformations you can leverage: \n    * **Filtering** is the process of selecting a subset of data that meets certain criteria or conditions. For example, only loading records from a certain period, such as after January 1st, 2010, is a filtering operation that excludes data from before that date.\n    * **Enriching** is the process of adding new information or value to existing data. For example, creating a new column titled Body Mass Index (BMI) by calculating values from the age, height, and weight columns is an enriching operation that adds a new measure of health to the data.\n    * **Splitting** is the process of breaking down a complex or composite data element into simpler or more atomic parts. For example, dividing the Full Name column into separate columns for First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name is a splitting operation that separates the name components.\n    * **Joining** is the process of combining data from different sources or tables based on a common attribute or key. For example, combining data from HR and Finance to generate employee payroll reports is a joining operation that merges data from two departments using the employee ID as the key.\n    * **Removing** duplicate data is the process of eliminating redundant or repeated data elements from a data set. For example, removing duplicate records of the same order from the Orders table is a data operation that ensures data quality and accuracy.\n    * **Review:** Once the transformations are applied, you must check the transformed data to ensure it has been formatted correctly.\n\nBesides these steps, you may need to perform other customized operations to\ntailor the data to your desired format. Once the data has been transformed,\nyou can load it into the target destination to put it to work. Remember that\nnot all data require transformation\u2014sometimes, the source data is suitable for\nimmediate use.\n\n## Data Transformation Types\n\nThe data transformation capability is available in various data integration\ntools. A good thing about this process is that you can do it in several ways.\nEach approach comes with its unique benefits and limitations. Let\u2019s look at\nsome of the standard transformation techniques.\n\n### On-Premises Data Transformation\n\nOn-premises data transformation is the process of using a data management tool\nor application installed and hosted on the organization\u2019s servers or\ninfrastructure to perform data transformation tasks. It helps with increased\nregulatory compliance and better security management. Most tools come with\ndrag-and-drop functionality, which means that non-technical employees can\ntransform data and convert it into a usable format.\n\n### Cloud-Based Data Transformation\n\nCloud data transformation is the process of using a software tool or service\nthat is hosted and accessed on the internet or a cloud platform to perform\ndata transformation tasks. The pay-as-you-go feature of most cloud-based tools\nallows businesses to scale up and down as and when necessary, which is one of\nthe reasons why cloud-based tools are popular.\n\nWhile saving crucial enterprise data on a third-party cloud-based server has\nits share of security concerns, one benefit of transforming data on the cloud\nis short installation and configuration times. This means businesses can make\nchanges to their data without experiencing significant delays.\n\n### Manual Data Transformation\n\nManual data transformation is the process of manually writing code or scripts\nto manipulate and transform data from one format or structure to another. This\nprocess requires a high level of technical expertise and can be time-\nconsuming, error-prone, and costly, especially when dealing with multiple file\nformats.\n\nThis requires a professional on the team dedicated to this task, increasing\nthe risk of human error and inaccuracy.\n\n**Easily Convert Data With Our Drag-And-Drop Solution**\n\n**SEE HOW IT\u2019S DONE  **\n\n## Data Transformation Techniques\n\nTransformation techniques are different from data transformation types. There\nare multiple ways to transform your data, but techniques vary according to\nyour goals and needs. The following are some of the most used data\ntransformation techniques:\n\n### 1) Data Smoothing\n\nData smoothing is used to remove meaningless or distorted data **(also called\nnoise)** from a dataset. Smoothing algorithms help you highlight random\nfluctuations and outliers, making it easier to remove unnecessary information.\n\nFor instance, data smoothing is crucial in helping traders and investors\nidentify patterns and trends in stock prices. It helps remove noise and helps\nthem plan better to accommodate  seasonality and volatility of stock prices.\nTraders leverage data smoothing techniques like the moving average to\ncalculate the average price of a stock over a specific duration.\n\nLearn how to perform data smoothing in time series analysis.\n\n### 2) Data Aggregation\n\nData aggregation is one of the most crucial data transformation techniques.\nIt\u2019s the process of standardizing data gathered from multiple sources by\nstoring it in a desired format. It makes data easy to retrieve and present.\n\nAggregated data can help you in several ways. For instance, you can aggregate\ndata from your website, email campaigns, CRM system, surveys, and social media\nto more accurately analyze customer demographics, behavior metrics, and\npreferences.\n\n### 3) Discretization\n\nDiscretization **(also called binning)** is another useful technique for data\ntransformation. It helps transform continuous data into a series of data\nintervals and replaces continuous attribute values with interval labels,\nmaking data easier to analyze.\n\nFor instance, patient age in healthcare datasets is stored numerically, but\ntransforming these numerical values into intervals (e.g., patients aged 18 to\n25) makes it easier to study patient dynamics.\n\n### 4) Generalization\n\nGeneralization is a data transformation technique that allows you to convert\nlower-level data into higher-level data based on a predefined taxonomy or\nhierarchy. For instance, you can use this technique to replace cities in a\ndataset with their country or continent. Likewise, timestamp values such as\n2023-08-17 15:26:43 can be replaced with August 2023, 2023, or 2020s.\n\n### 5) Construction of Attributes\n\nThis technique can help you generate new attributes based on existing\nattributes. For instance, if you have a dataset logging the date and time of\ntransactions, it can help you create new attributes such as day of week,\nmonth, season, hour, etc. These new attributes can then help identify trends\nor patterns, such as seasonal effects, peak hours, and more.\n\n### 6) Scaling\n\nScaling in data transformation is a technique that transforms the values of a\ndataset into a common scale. One example of scaling is **min-max** , which\nscales the data to a range between **0 and 1**. Scaling helps preserve the\nrelative order and distance of the original values. There are other types of\nscaling techniques, such as z-score, log, and clipping.\n\n### 7) Normalization\n\n**Normalization (pivot)** and **denormalization (unpivot)** are two techniques\nthat transform the data from rows to columns or vice versa. They help you\noptimize, enhance, and protect your data for different purposes. Normalization\n(pivot) reduces the data size and complexity by grouping it into categories or\ndimensions. Denormalization (unpivot) increases the data speed and richness by\nsplitting it by attributes or values.\n\n### Turn Disparate Data  \nInto Powerful Insights\n\nTransform raw data into accurate insights in minutes.  \nEasily establish connectivity with a wide range of sources.\n\nGet Your Free Trial!\n\n## Astera: The Easy Way to Transform Data\n\nAstera is a complete data integration platform that allows users to extract,\nmap, transform, and load their data in a code-free environment.
