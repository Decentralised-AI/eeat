The data transformation process\nis an integral component of data management and data integration. Likewise,\ncompanies can improve their data-driven decision-making by streamlining their\ndata management and integration processes through data transformation.\n\nHowever, as more and more companies adopt cloud-based data storage (IDC\nreports that today 67% of enterprise infrastructure is cloud-based), the data\ntransformation process must follow suit. Consequently, many companies are\nsearching for public web data integration processes and data transformation\ntools that help improve the data quality, readability, and organization\ncompany-wide.\n\nIn this article, I will explore the data transformation process, how it\ncontributes to the broader processes of data integration, as well as new data\ntransformation technologies.\n\n## Benefits of data transformation\n\nFrom a general perspective, data transformation helps businesses take raw data\n(structured or unstructured) and transform it for further processing,\nincluding analysis, integration, and visualization. All teams within a\ncompany\u2019s structure benefit from data transformation, as low-quality unmanaged\ndata can negatively impact all facets of business operations. Some additional\nbenefits of data transformation include:\n\n  * Improved data organization and management \n  * Increased computer and end-user accessibility\n  * Enhanced data quality and reduced errors\n  * Greater application compatibility and faster data processing \n\n## Data integration\n\nBefore examining the various ways to transform data, it is important to take a\nstep back and look at the data integration process. Data integration processes\nmultiple types of source data into integrated data, during which the data\nundergoes cleaning, transformation, analysis, loading, etc. With that, we can\nsee that data transformation is simply a subset of data integration.\n\nData integration as a whole involves extraction, transformation, cleaning, and\nloading. Over time, data scientists have combined and rearranged these steps,\nconsequently creating four data integration processes: batch, ETL, ELT, and\nreal-time integration.\n\n### Batch integration\n\nAnother common method is batch data integration, which involves moving batches\nof stored data through further transformation and loading processes. This\nmethod is mainly used for internal databases, large amounts of data, and data\nthat is not time-sensitive.\n\n### ETL integration\n\nSimilar to ELT, ETL data processing involves data integration through\nextraction, transformation, and loading. ETL integration is the most common\nform of data integration and utilizes batch integration techniques.\n\n### ELT integration\n\nELT data processing involves data integration through extraction, loading, and\ntransformation. Similar to real-time integration, ELT applies open-source\ntools and cloud technology, making this method best for organizations that\nneed to transform massive amounts of data at a relatively quick pace.\n\n### Real-time integration\n\nOne of the more recent data integration methods, real-time integration,\nprocesses and transforms data upon collection and extraction. This method\nutilizes CDC (Change Data Capture) techniques, among others, and is helpful\nfor data processing that requires near-instant use.\n\nThese same concepts utilized in data integration have also been applied to the\nindividual steps within the larger integration process, such as data\ntransformation. More specifically, both batch data processing and cloud\ntechnology, utilized in real-time integration, have been crucial in developing\nsuccessful data transformation processes and data transformation tools. Now,\nlet\u2019s take a closer look at the types of data transformation processes.\n\nFirst party data (data you collect yourself about your company and your\ncustomers) is rapidly growing in value. Your ability to transform and use that\ndata to drive decisions and strategies will increasingly become the source of\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n\\- Rich Edwards, CEO of Mindspan Systems\n\n## Types of data transformation\n\n### Batch data transformation\n\nBatch data transformation, also known as bulk data transformation, involves\ntransforming data in groups over a period of time. Traditional batch data\ntransformation involves manual execution with scripted languages such as SQL\nand Python and is now seen as somewhat outdated.\n\nMore specifically, batch transformation involves ETL data integration, in\nwhich the data is stored in one location and then transformed and moved in\nsmaller batches over time. It is important to note the significance of batch\ndata transformation on many data integration processes, such as web\napplication integration, data warehousing, and data virtualization. When\napplied to other data integration processes, the concepts and logistics within\nbatch data transformation can improve the overall integration process.\n\n### Interactive data transformation\n\nAs many companies turn to cloud-based systems, IBM even reports that 81% of\ncompanies use multiple cloud-based systems, end-users of said data are also\nlooking for more versatile methods to transform data. Interactive data\ntransformation, also referred to as real-time data transformation uses similar\nconcepts seen in real-time integration and ELT processing.\n\nInteractive data transformation is an expansion of batch transformation.\nHowever, the steps are not necessarily linear. Gaining traction for its\naccessible end-user visual interface, interactive data transformation takes\npreviously generated and inspected code to identify outliers, patterns, and\nerrors within the data. It then sends this information to a graphical user\ninterface for human end-users to quickly visualize trends, patterns, and more,\nwithin the data.\n\n## Data transformation languages\n\nIn addition to the various types of data transformation, developers can also\nutilize a variety of transformation languages to transform formal language\ntext into a more useful and readable output text. There are four main types of\ndata transformation languages: macro languages, model transformation\nlanguages, low-level languages, and XML transformation languages.\n\nThe most commonly used codes in data transformation include ATL, AWK, identity\ntransform, QVT, TXL, XQuery, and XSLT. Ultimately, before deciding what\ntransformation method and language to use, data scientists must consider the\nsource of the data, the type of data being transformed, and the project\u2019s\nobjective.\n\n## The data transformation process\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the bigger picture of how data transformation fits into\nthe larger picture of data integration, we can examine the more granular steps\nin data transformation itself. Firstly, it is important to note that while\nit's possible to transform data manually, today, companies rely on data\ntransformation tools to partially or fully transform their data. Either way,\nmanual and automated data transformation involves the same steps detailed\nbelow.\n\n### 1\\. Data discovery and parsing\n\nThe first step in the data transformation process involves data discovery and\ndata parsing. Data discovery and data parsing are processes that involve\ncollecting data, consolidating data, and reorganizing data for specific market\ninsights and business intelligence. At Coresignal, we can offer you parsed,\nready-to-use data.\n\n### 2\\. Data mapping and translation\n\nOnce you have profiled your data and decided how you want to transform your\ndata, you can perform data mapping and translation. Data mapping and\ntranslation refer to the process of mapping, aggregating, and filtering said\ndata so it can be further processed. For example, in batch transformation,\nthis step would help filter and sort the data in batches so executable code\ncan run smoothly.\n\n### 3\\. Programming and code creation\n\nThe data programming involves code generation, in which developers will work\nwith executable coding languages, such as SQL, Python, R, or other executable\ninstructions. During this stage, developers are working closely with\ntransformation technologies, also known as code generators. Code generators\nprovide developers with a visual design atmosphere and can run on multiple\nplatforms, making them a favorite among developers.\n\n### 4\\. Transforming the data\n\nNow that the code is developed, it can be run against your data. Also known as\ncode execution, this step is the last stage the data passes through before\nreaching human end-users.\n\n### 5\\. Reviewing the data\n\nOnce the code executes the data, it is now ready for review. Similar to a\nquality assurance check, the purpose of this step is to make sure the data has\nbeen transformed properly. It is important to note that this step is\niterative, in that end-users of this data are responsible for reporting any\nerrors they found in transformed data to the developers, so edits to the code\ncan be made.\n\nData extraction and transformation have an effect on other business\nactivities. When data is transformed into a more readable format, data\nanalysis can be completed more quickly and accurately than before. Not only\ndoes this have an effect on employee morale, but it also has an impact on\ncompany decision-making.\n\n\\- Brian Stewart, CTO of ProsperoWeb\n\n## ETL vs. ELT\n\nThe recent advancements in big data have required businesses to look elsewhere\nwhen storing, processing, and analyzing their data. Moreso, the increasing\nvariety in data sources has also contributed to the strain being placed on\ndata warehouses. Particularly, while companies acquire powerful raw data from\ndata types such as firmographic data, employee data, and social media data,\nthese same data types typically export very large file sizes. Consequently,\ncompanies have been searching for alternative methods.\n\nThis search has greatly impacted data integration processes, specifically data\ntransformation. That is, companies have been transitioning from traditional\ndata integration processes, such as ETL methods, to cloud-based integration\nprocesses, such as ELT and real-time integration.\n\nIn the past, many companies have relied on local servers for data storage,\nmaking ETL integration the preferred method. However, due to the significant\nincrease in digital communication and business operations in 2020, global data\ncreation is now modeled at a CAGR of 23%, according to Businesswire.\nSubsequently, the upward trend in global data creation has put a strain on\nlocal servers and data storage, and many businesses are looking elsewhere for\ncloud-based solutions.\n\n### What is data transformation in ETL?\n\nETL, which stands for extraction, transformation, and loading, is a data\nintegration process that involves extracting data from various external\nsources, often from third-party data providers, transforming the data into the\nappropriate structure, and then loading that data into a company\u2019s database.\nThe ETL process is considered the most common integration process compared to\nELT, ETM, and EMM transformation processes.\n\nData transformation within ETL occurs in the transformation step; however, it\nis closely linked to the extraction and loading stages. Traditionally, data\ntransformation within the ETL method utilizes batch transformation with linear\nsteps, including discovery, mapping, programming, code execution, and data\nreview.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs businesses collect an increasing volume of data, many are forced to find\ndata storage and processing solutions that can handle massive amounts of data\nwith limited money and resources. Similarly, companies are also looking for\ndata transformation solutions that can meet the current needs and industry\nstandards. Companies are recognizing the future of data transformation and\nshifting towards utilizing cloud-based technology in processes such as ELT\nintegration and interactive data transformation.\n\n _This article was originally published onData Science Central._\n\n **Boost your growth**\n\nSee a variety of datasets that will help your business growth.\n\nSee datasets\n\nShare:\n\n### Don\u2019t miss a thing\n\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter to learn how you can grow your business\nwith public web data.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBy providing your email address you agree to receive newsletters from\nCoresignal.
