All\n  2. /\n\nData Transformation\n\n## What Is Data Transformation?\n\nData transformation is the process of taking raw data that has been extracted\nfrom data sources and turning it into usable datasets. Data pipelines often\ninclude multiple data transformations, changing messy information into clean,\nquality, trusted data that organizations can use to meet operational needs and\ncreate actionable insights. The data transformation process is a key process\nin data engineering.\n\n## Here\u2019s more to explore\n\nBig Book of Data Engineering: 2nd Edition\n\nExplore the latest technical guidance for building real-time data pipelines.\n\nDownload now\n\nGet Started With ETL\n\nLearn about ETL pipelines with this O\u2019Reilly guide preview.\n\nDownload now\n\nLakehouse Fundamentals\n\nGet up to speed on lakehouse by taking this free on-demand training.\n\nStart now\n\n## Why is data transformation important?\n\nThe data transformation process manipulates datasets so they can be used by\nbusiness data applications. It\u2019s critical for realizing value from raw data by\ngenerating insights that can be used to make business decisions.\nTransformation gives organizations the data they need to better understand the\npast, present and future of their business and pursue opportunities in an\nagile way.\n\n## Data transformation and ETL\n\nData transformation is at the heart of ETL, which stands for extract,\ntransform and load. This is the process data engineers use to pull data from\ndifferent sources, transform it into a usable and trusted resource, and load\nthat data into the systems end-users can access and use downstream to solve\nbusiness problems. In the transform stage, data gets cleansed, mapped and\ntransformed, often to a specific schema.\n\n## Data transformation examples\n\nSeveral different types of transformation can be used to ensure the quality\nand integrity of data. These range from data de-duplication, which increases\ndata quality and performance by removing duplicated data, to data refining,\nwhich increases quality by filtering out data that is irrelevant, to data\nintegration, in which different data types are merged into the same structure.\nFor more types of data transformation and their definitions, see the next\nsection.\n\n## Types of data transformation\n\nThe data transformation process can be accomplished via several different\ntechniques, depending on the data and end transformation goal. These may\ninclude:\n\n **Bucketing/binning:** Dividing a numeric series into smaller \u201cbuckets\u201d or\n\u201cbins.\u201d This is done by changing numeric features into categorical features\nusing a set of thresholds.\n\n **Data aggregation:** The process of summarizing data so it can be better\nused in reporting and visualization. Aggregation can be achieved by using\ndifferent methods, such as using the sum, average or median of values over\ntime, space or other dimensions.\n\n **Data cleansing:** The process of increasing data accuracy and quality by\ndeleting inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date information.\n\n **Data de-duplication:** A compression process in which duplicate copies of\ndata are identified and removed to speed up the data transfer process.\n\n **Data derivation:** Creating rules to extract only the specific information\nneeded from the data source.\n\n **Data enrichment:** A process of enhancing existing data using external data\nsources to expand a data field or supplement missing data fields.\n\n **Data filtering:** Refining data to eliminate irrelevant data to display\nonly the information that is needed.\n\n **Data integration:** Merging different data types into the same structure.\nData integration standardizes disparate data so that it can be analyzed as a\nwhole.\n\n **Data joining:** An operation that merges multiple database tables using a\ncommon data field into a single dataset.\n\n **Data splitting:** Dividing a single column into multiple columns in order\nto analyze the data. This can be useful for analyzing large amounts of data\ngathered over time.\n\n **Data summarization:** A type of data aggregation in which different\nbusiness metrics are created by calculating value totals.\n\n **Data validation:** Ensuring data quality by creating automated rules that\ngenerate responses to specific data issues.\n\n **Format revision:** The process of changing formats to solve problems\nrelated to fields containing different data types.\n\n **Key restructuring:** The process of changing keys with built-in meanings to\ngeneric keys (random numbers that reference the information in the source\ndatabase) to prevent slowdowns in the data system.\n\n## Data transformation performance optimizations\n\nThe data transformation process can be both time- and resource-consuming, so\noptimizing data transformation performance is crucial to reduce costs and save\ntime. Performance optimization techniques include:\n\n  * Data compaction\n  * Partitioning\n  * File size tuning\n  * Data skipping and pruning\n  * Data caching\n\nLearn more about optimizing data transformation performance with our\ncomprehensive guide.\n\n## Data transformation tools\n\nData transformation is critical for creating reliable data that organizations\ncan use for insights. However, the data transformation process and the entire\nETL process present serious challenges, from building and maintaining reliable\ndata pipelines to managing data quality in increasingly complex pipeline\narchitectures. Data transformation tools streamline and democratize\ntransformation and simplify the ETL lifecycle.\n\n## Data transformation on the Data Intelligence Platform\n\nDatabricks offers essential tools for implementing and orchestrating data\ntransformations and ETL on the Data Intelligence Platform.\n\nDelta Live Tables (DLT) helps data engineering teams easily build and manage\nreliable batch and streaming data pipelines that deliver high-quality data on\nthe Data Intelligence Platform. DLT provides automatic data quality testing,\nmakes streaming more cost-effective through efficient compute autoscaling, and\noffers deep visibility for pipeline monitoring and observability.\n\nDatabricks Workflows is a fully integrated managed orchestration service that\nempowers data teams to better automate and orchestrate data pipelines.\nWorkflows helps users easily define, manage and monitor multitask workflows\nfor ETL, analytics and machine learning pipelines to boost productivity.\nWorkflows integrates seamlessly with dbt, a tool that allows anyone on a data\nteam to safely contribute to production-grade data pipelines and makes\ntransformation faster and more secure.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n  * ETL (Extract Transform Load)\n  * Data
