They are no longer solely\nresponsible for managing databases and data warehouses that store data in a\nstructured format. They must now also learn to deal with all kinds of data\ntypes, including semi-structured and unstructured data as well as data formats\nlike JSON, XML, Parquet, and others.\n\nDue to the many different possible sources of data, a significant and\nessential part of the modern data engineering process is to transform data,\nwhich may exist in different types and formats, into a format that makes it\npossible to draw meaningful insights. This need led to data transformations\nbecoming an essential part of the data engineering process.\n\n## Data transformation definition\n\nRaw data is often messy, inconsistent, and incomplete upon ingestion, making\nit difficult to analyze for valuable insights. The data transformation process\ninvolves modifying, cleaning, and enriching ingested data to improve data\nquality, usefulness, and accessibility.\n\nBy transforming data, data engineers and analysts can prepare it for further\nanalysis, modeling, and visualization, ultimately leading to better decision-\nmaking and improved business outcomes. The ever-evolving role of a data\nengineer means that there are now also new  methods for transforming data.\n\nTraditionally, data transformation would happen right after the data is\nextracted or loaded from a source, ensuring that it lands in a clean and\naccurate format in a target destination, which would typically be a data\nwarehouse or data lake. This process is known as the Extract, Transform, Load\n(ETL) process.\n\nHowever, recently there has been a shift from traditional ETL to extracting\nthe data first, then loading it directly to a data warehouse, where all the\ntransformations can occur. This Extract, Load Transform workflow is known as\nELT. This shift is occurring for different reasons. The primary driver is that\ndata warehousing solutions are now available as highly scalable cloud\ncomputing resources that have become accessible to many companies regardless\nof their maturity level. Another reason is that ELT streamlines the process in\na way that reduces resource contention on data sources, making it faster to\nget clean, transformed data in the cloud data warehouse. Lastly, as storage\nand compute costs have decreased, many data engineers appreciate the ability\nto store a copy of the untransformed data, giving them the option to augment\nor re-run transformations on the original data as the needs of the business\nchange.\n\n## Data transformation process\n\nLike any stage in the data analysis process, data transformation involves\nmultiple steps and is one of the areas that requires the most pre-planning to\nget right. Data engineers and analysts typically follow these steps to\nsuccessfully get their data in the form it needs to be in.\n\n  1.  **Assess quality and structure** : this is the data discovery part that is often used in the early stages of a data analysis project. This often involves querying and exploring datasets using built in data profiling tools as well as sampling and visualizing data to gain a better understanding of the data ingested from various data sources and how it can be used. Ultimately, this analysis reveals how the data needs to be transformed.\n  2.  **Plan the transformation** : Once the quality and structure of the data have been assessed, a plan for the transformation can be developed. This involves identifying the specific steps that need to be taken to transform the data, such as cleaning, normalizing, and aggregating. This step can be used to build out data models that can be reused consistently across different transformation projects.\n  3.  **Data mapping and integration** : there are certain scenarios where data would need to be moved from a specific source system that has an entirely different type and format from the target destination. For example, data integration might require data from a customer relationship management (CRM) system like Salesforce to be loaded into a specific schema format in a data warehouse. Different ETL/ELT tools exist today to ensure this mapping happens automatically.\n  4.  **Implement the transformations** : The next step is to actually implement the transformation plan. This could involve using software tools to clean and manipulate the data or writing code and scripting to perform more complex transformations.\n  5.  **Validate and repeat as necessary** : Depending on the complexity of the transformation and the quality of the original data, it may be necessary to repeat some or all of the steps in the process. This could involve going back and re-cleaning the data, adjusting the transformation plan, or re-validating the transformed data.\n\n **Use the data** : Once the data has been transformed to an appropriate form,\nit is then  ready to be analyzed using business intelligence tools or fed into\nmachine learning algorithms for predictive analytics use cases.\n\n## Why Transform Data?\n\nWhen data is collected from different sources, it may be in different formats\nor have different structures. Data transformation can help to combine data\nfrom different sources into a unified dataset that is consistent and usable.\n\nData may also lack compatibility with the intended destination, which could be\na database or software application. Data transformation can help to convert\ndata into a usable format for the intended purpose and also be used to add\nadditional information or context to the data, such as merging data with other\ndata sources or appending metadata to make it more useful and provide\nadditional insight to the use case at hand.\n\nWithout data transformation, data management would be much more difficult.\nData can become disorganized, leading to wasted time and effort from data\nengineers, who should instead focus on ensuring that the data is secure,\nreliable, and optimized to meet operational standards.\n\n## Challenges of data transformation\n\nLike any complex process, data transformation may also come with a set of\nchallenges that make it harder for data analysts and engineers to follow best\npractices for transforming data:\n\n  * Data transformation can be expensive and resource-intensive. Specifically, dealing with big data (extremely large data sets) requires a different set of tools and skills. As data sets increase in size, data engineers are required to learn and understand new data transformation methodologies that allow them to manage data efficiently while taking into account data scalability.\n  * Often, in order to execute more complex tasks and build efficient data pipelines, especially for machine learning use cases, it's necessary to use Python for automation and data transformation. This means that many data engineers are no longer only required to only know SQL, but often additional languages, database functionalities, and data formats.\n  * Lacking a clear plan or contextual knowledge of the industry can make writing extensible data transformations difficult. Different industries have different ways of managing data. Data analysts and engineers should have a clear and deep understanding of the domain in which the data operates in order to avoid errors during data transformation.\n  * Data security and privacy: Data transformation may involve sensitive or confidential data, so it's important to ensure appropriate security and privacy measures are in place to protect the data.\n\nIterative process: Data transformation is often an iterative process, which\nmeans that multiple rounds of data aggregation, cleaning, and normalization\nmay be required. It\u2019s important to make sure the right automation and data\ntransformation tools are used to prevent human error as much as possible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhether you are a data analyst, data engineer, or data scientist, data\ntransformation is a necessary step for obtaining high-quality data and setting\nup projects for success. The data transformation process can be complex and\ntime-consuming, and it requires careful planning and execution to ensure that\ndata is accurate, consistent, and in a usable format. As the volume and\ncomplexity of data continue to grow, the importance of data transformation\nwill only continue to increase, making it a key area of focus for data\nprofessionals and organizations alike.\n\n###### Get the Data Maturity Guide\n\nOur comprehensive, 80-page Data Maturity Guide will help you build on your\nexisting tools and take the next step on your journey.\n\nGet the Guide\n\nBuild a data pipeline in less than 5 minutes\n\nCreate an account\n\nSee RudderStack in action\n\nGet a personalized demo\n\nCollaborate with our community of data engineers\n\nJoin Slack Community\n\nGet started today\n\nStart building smarter customer data pipelines today with RudderStack.

Our goal is to help\nyou build your customer data platform on top of your own data warehouse. We\nthink your customer data should not live in a data silo where you need to run\ncomplex functions inside of a black box. For an in depth comparison, see our\nRudderStack vs. Segment guide.\n\nHow do I get in touch with you?\n\nIf you'd like a demo, you can fill out this form and we'll get back to you\nsoon! You can also join our community of data professionals, or follow us on\nsocial media: Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nWhat counts as an event?\n\nAn event is a data point generated by a website, app, server, or cloud\napplication. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re browsing a website. When the page\nloads, that generates a page call that counts as 1 event.\n\nDo you offer an open-source product as well?\n\nYes, we actively contribute to our open-source code as you can see on our\nGitHub page. The open-source project is released under AGPLv3. The core data\nprocessing layer is the same for both the Community and Enterprise edition.\nThe Enterprise edition comes with some more advanced reporting & clustering\nfeatures, but those are built on top of the data plane.\n\nWhat type of support is available with the Free plan?\n\nWe don\u2019t offer dedicated support, but we have a very active community on Slack\nwhere you can ask any questions. Join us here! If you\u2019re on any of our paid\nplans, you'll have some level of support from our team. If you are on the\nEnterprise plan, you will have an account manager and a dedicated Slack\nchannel.\n\nWho created RudderStack and how did it start?\n\nRudderStack was founded in 2019 by a team of engineers with experience in\ncustomer data. The company has received funding from Insight Partners, Kleiner\nPerkins and S28 Capital.
