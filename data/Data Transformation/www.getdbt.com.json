Read now\n\nData transformation is the process of taking raw data and making meaning out\nof it; it forms the foundation of all analytics work and represents how data\npractitioners create tangible value from their companies.\n\nThe data transformation process can typically be broken down into six\ngenerally-defined steps: extraction and loading, exploration, transformation,\ntesting, documentation, and deployment. After these steps are taken, raw data\ntakes a new form of meaningful tables that power your company\u2019s business\nintelligence efforts.\n\nWe\u2019ll use this page to describe what the data transformation process looks\nlike for a typical ELT workflow.\n\n## Step 1: Extract and load\n\nIf your team is following an ELT workflow, where raw data sources are\nextracted and loaded into the data warehouse before data is transformed,\nyou\u2019ll need to actually accomplish those extraction and loading steps before\nbeginning your transformation work!\n\n### Extraction\n\nIn the extraction process, data is extracted from multiple data sources\nrelated to your business. The data extracted is, for the most part, data that\nteams eventually want to use for analytics work. Some examples of data sources\ncan include: backend application databases, marketing platforms, email and\nsales CRMs, and more.\n\nThis data is typically extracted from their systems by interacting with an\nApplication Programming Interface (API) via custom scripts, or relying on the\nuse of an open-source or Software as a Service (SaaS) ETL tool to remove some\nof the technical lift.\n\n### **Loading**\n\nDuring the loading stage, data that was extracted is loaded into the target\ndata warehouse. Some examples of modern data warehouses include Snowflake,\nAmazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery. Examples of other data storage platforms\ninclude data lakes such as Databricks\u2019s Data Lakes. Most of the SaaS\napplications that extract data from your data sources will also load it into\nyour target data warehouse. Custom or in-house extraction and load processes\nusually require strong data engineering and technical skills.\n\n## **Step 2: Data exploration**\n\nOnce raw data is in your data warehouse, it\u2019s time to get an understanding of\nwhat this data looks like. During this stage, you\u2019ll find yourself:\n\n  * Looking at available ERDs (entity relationship diagrams) and join keys to understand how data joins itself together\n  * Identifying which columns are potentially missing values or have misleading column names\n  * Writing ad hoc queries to perform some light analysis or summary statistics on the data\u2014how many rows are there? Are primary keys unique? _Is there a primary key?_\n  * Understanding how currency, timezone, and data types differ across data sources\n\nThere is no perfect recipe for how to explore your raw data; do what feels\nnecessary for your data sources. If you have high confidence in the accuracy\nand completeness of your raw data, this step may feel less laborious than if\nyou question the integrity of your data (which, if you\u2019re a data practitioner,\nis probably your natural inclination \ud83d\ude09).\n\n## Step 3: Data transformation\n\nIn the actual transformation step, the raw data that has been loaded into your\ndata warehouse, you\u2019re familiar with how that data is structured, and you have\na general plan on how to approach it\u2014it\u2019s finally ready for your modeling\nprocess to begin! When you first looked at this data during the data\nexploration stage, you may have noticed a few things about it\u2026\n\n  * Column names may or may not be clear\n  * Tables are not joined to other tables\n  * Timestamps may be in the incorrect timezone for your reporting\n  * JSON is abundant and may need unnesting\n  * Tables may be missing primary keys\n\n\u2026hence the need for transformation! During the actual transformation process,\ndata from your data sources is usually:\n\n  * Lightly transformed: Fields are cast correctly, timestamp fields\u2019 timezones are made uniform, tables and fields are renamed appropriately, and more. In dbt, this usually happens in staging models used to create clean, uniform slates for your data.\n  * Heavily transformed: Business logic is added, appropriate materializations are established, data is joined together, aggregates and metrics are created, etc. In dbt, this usually happens in intermediate and mart models, creating the tables that are ultimately exposed to end business users and business intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nCommon ways to transform your data include leveraging modern technologies such\nas dbt to write modular and version-controlled transformations using SQL and\nPython. Other solutions include writing custom SQL and Python scripts that are\nautomated by some type of scheduler or utilizing stored procedures.\n\n## Step 4: Data testing\n\nYour data is modeled now and _feels generally_ right, but how are you\nconfirming the quality of the data that is transformed? How are you ensuring\nthat the key metrics and data you\u2019re exposing to downstream users are\ntrustworthy and reliable?\n\nAt this stage, data testing that meets your organization\u2019s standards should be\nconducted. This may look like:\n\n  * Testing primary key for uniqueness and non-nullness \n  * Ensuring column values fall in an expected range\n  * Checking that model relations line-up\n  * And more.\n\nUsing a product like dbt, where you can define code-based tests to run against\nyour data transformations, you can create a system where transformations are\neasily and regularly tested against the standards you establish.\n\n## Step 5: Data documentation\n\nYour data is transformed into meaningful business entities, tested to your\nstandards, and is exposed to end users. How do you expect folks who were not\ndirectly involved in the transformation process to navigate through them? What\ndocumentation are you creating to clarify business logic in transformations\nand describe core metrics and columns?\n\nAt this stage, transformation is done, but in a way, the work is just getting\nstarted. To make your data transformations meaningful and impactful to end\nusers, it\u2019s important to create and maintain robust documentation.\n\nWe recommend you start by documenting the following during your transformation\nprocess:\n\n  * The primary purpose of a transformation or data model\u2014what is the main reason this transformation was created? What important reports is it powering in your BI tool?\n  * Key columns that have business logic implemented in them or ambiguous column names\n  * Aggregates and metrics\n\nDocumentation for data transformation processes should often be written in a\nway that is understandable to the people who were not involved in the original\nprocess, instead of focusing on the _how_ of a transformation for more\ntechnical users. Well-written transformation documentation welcomes business\nusers into the fold of analytics work, and is a foundational way to ensure\nyour end users feels comfortable and empowered to use the data your team works\nso hard to build.\n\n## Step 6: Schedule and automate\n\nYour data transformations are created, tested, and documented\u2014now it\u2019s time to\nget them out into the world. At this stage, data engineers, data analysts, or\nanalytics engineers will push these transformations to production\u2014the process\nof running them in a production environment in the data warehouse. These\nproduction-ready tables are what analysts will query against for analysis and\nwhat a BI tool will read off of.\n\nThese data transformations will need to be refreshed, or updated, on a cadence\nthat meets your business needs using some type of scheduler or orchestrator.\nUsing a product like dbt Cloud, you can create your data transformations and\ntests within a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) and then\nrun them on a regular cadence using the dbt Cloud job scheduler. Other\nsolutions that often require more technical lift include relying on custom\ncron schedulers or external orchestrators.\n\n## Rise and repeat!\n\nAfter you build your foundational data transformations, your focus will likely\nshift to optimizing, governing, and democratizing the work; for each new data\nsource, business problem, or entity needed, there will always be more data\ntransformation work to get done. As a result, a good data transformation\nprocess is one that is simultaneously rigid and flexible\u2014the process allows\nfor enough guardrails to make analytics work worthwhile and organized, with\nenough room to be interesting, challenging, and customized to your business.\n\nLast modified on: Mar 27, 2023\n\n  * Accelerate speed to insight \n  * Democratize data responsibly \n  * Build trust in data across business \n\nCreate a free account Book a demo __\n\nAchieve a 194% ROI with dbt Cloud.

It allows your\nteam to develop, test, document, and deploy SQL-based data transformations\nfrom the dbt Cloud UI.\n\nIt also includes access to dbt APIs, that allow you to programmatically run\nand monitor dbt jobs in your account.\n\nOnce your 14-day free trial is up, you can either continue for free on the\nDeveloper plan (which provides dbt Cloud access for a single developer but\ndoes not include API access), or upgrade to the Team or Enterprise plan.\n\n###  Will I have access to the dbt Community Slack?\n\nYes! The dbt Community Slack is home to over 80,000 analytics professionals,\nand commands significant attention from our dedicated dbt Community team.\n\nYou\u2019ll find channels like #advice-dbt-for-beginners, dedicated channels for\nusers of various warehouses + BI tools, and groups for analytics leaders\n(#leading-data-teams, #analytics-craft).\n\nThe dbt Community Slack is also where all attendees of our annual analytics\nengineering conference, Coalesce, connect during the event.\n\n###  I\u2019m new to dbt, how should I get started?\n\nMany users of all skill levels begin developing their first transformation\nwithin minutes of connecting their warehouse by following the getting started\ntutorial.\n\nFor a structured introduction, our free dbt Fundamentals course covers\neverything you need to know to model, test, document, and deploy your first\nproject.\n\nIf your data team is looking for a more interactive experience, we also offer\nin-depth \u201cclassroom\u201d training to Enterprise customers:\n\n  * Rapid Onboarding: Jumpstart your dbt Cloud implementation using your own data\n  * Group Training: Build skills and confidence with sample data in a sandbox environment\n\nAdditionally, dbt Community Slack, the dbt docs hub and the developer blog are\nexcellent resources for self or peer-to-peer education.\n\n###  Do I need to be comfortable working on the command line to use dbt?\n\nNo! dbt Cloud includes an integrated development environment (IDE) with \u201cgit-\nguardrails\u201d that allow you to start safely building and deploying dbt models\nwithout setting up your local machine or working on the command line.\n\n## Billing and Security FAQs\n\nFrequently asked questions about dbt plans, pricing and billing.\n\n###  How does billing work?\n\nTeam plans are billed monthly on the credit card used to sign up, based on\ndeveloper seat count ($100USD per seat per month) and successful models built\n(over 15,000 per month). You\u2019ll also be sent a monthly receipt to the billing\nemail of your choice. If you\u2019d like to change any billing information, just\nreach out to us at support@getdbt.com.\n\nEnterprise plan customers are billed annually based on the number of developer\nseats and successful models built, as well as any additional services +\nfeatures in your chosen plan.\n\n###  Can I pay by invoice?\n\nAt present, dbt Cloud Team plan payments must be made via credit card, and by\ndefault they will be billed monthly based on the number of developer seats.\n\nWe don\u2019t have any plans to do invoicing for Team plan accounts in the near\nfuture, but we do currently support invoices for companies on the dbt Cloud\nEnterprise plan. Feel free to contact us to build your Enterprise pricing\nplan.\n\n###  Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?\n\n\u200b\u200bYes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Account Owners can access\ntheir dedicated billing page via the account settings page: just click the\nhamburger icon and \u201cBilling\u201d to adjust your plan or update credit card\ninformation.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which plan is right for you, get in touch and we\u2019ll be\nhappy to help you find one that fits your needs.\n\n###  What if I want to cancel my account?\n\nYou can cancel your account at any time on your Account Settings page. Of\ncourse, we\u2019d hate to see you go \u2013 drop us a line and we\u2019ll do everything we\ncan to make it right!\n\n###  Does dbt store my data?\n\ndbt Cloud stores the following data persistently:\n\n  * dbt Cloud account information including job definitions, database connection information, users, etc. Cloud account information does not include any raw data from your warehouse.\n  * Logs associated with jobs and interactive queries you\u2019ve run.\n  * Your dbt \u201cassets\u201d which include artifacts like run_results.json and manifest.json.\n\nLogs and assets do not include raw data from the warehouse, unless the code\nyou write commands it.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s possible to write dbt code that fetches all customer data\nfrom your customer table and writes it to the logs. While that\u2019s usually not a\ngood idea and we do not recommend it, if you did that it\u2019d mean that\ninformation is stored in dbt Cloud.\n\n###  How is data processed by the dbt IDE?\n\nWhen writing interactive queries from the IDE (for example: `select * from\ncustomers limit 100`) the resulting query output passes through dbt Cloud\ninfrastructure on the way to your browser.\n\nHowever, this data is not persisted in any way (caching or otherwise). It does\nnot live on our servers outside of your browser session.\n\n###  Where can I find information about the legacy Semantic Layer and dbt\nMetrics package?\n\nThe legacy version will be deprecated in December 2023. Learn how to upgrade\nto the new Semantic Layer with MetricFlow using this migration guide, and see\npricing information on the dbt Documentation Billing page.\n\n###  How does the Semantic Layer trial work?\n\nTeam and Enterprise customers can use 1,000 Queried Metrics per month for no\nadditional cost on a limited trial basis, subject to reasonable use\nlimitations. For more information, please see the dbt documentation Billing\nFAQs.\n\n###  Are there other account parameter limits aside from those mentioned\nabove?\n\nThere are other limitations that most clients are unlikely to encounter,\ndepending on client usage patterns. Truly \u201cunlimited\u201d usage of current and/or\nfuture features, products or services is never possible because costs,\nexpenses, and supplier charges are subject to fluctuation and/or inflationary\nor other permanent increases. Client usage must remain subject to other\nreasonable use limitations. dbt Labs reserves the right to adjust limits,\nencourage optimization or increase pricing dependent on market forces, client\nusage patterns, and, ultimately, its discretion.\n\n## Security and Compliance\n\nThe entire dbt Cloud\u2122 team is focused on keeping you and your data safe. We\nadhere to industry-leading standards to manage our network, secure our\napplication, and set policies across our organization.
