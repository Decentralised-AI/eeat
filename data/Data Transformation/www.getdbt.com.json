Read now\n\nData transformation is the process of taking raw data and making meaning out\nof it; it forms the foundation of all analytics work and represents how data\npractitioners create tangible value from their companies.\n\nThe data transformation process can typically be broken down into six\ngenerally-defined steps: extraction and loading, exploration, transformation,\ntesting, documentation, and deployment. After these steps are taken, raw data\ntakes a new form of meaningful tables that power your company\u2019s business\nintelligence efforts.\n\nWe\u2019ll use this page to describe what the data transformation process looks\nlike for a typical ELT workflow.\n\n## Step 1: Extract and load\n\nIf your team is following an ELT workflow, where raw data sources are\nextracted and loaded into the data warehouse before data is transformed,\nyou\u2019ll need to actually accomplish those extraction and loading steps before\nbeginning your transformation work!\n\n### Extraction\n\nIn the extraction process, data is extracted from multiple data sources\nrelated to your business. The data extracted is, for the most part, data that\nteams eventually want to use for analytics work. Some examples of data sources\ncan include: backend application databases, marketing platforms, email and\nsales CRMs, and more.\n\nThis data is typically extracted from their systems by interacting with an\nApplication Programming Interface (API) via custom scripts, or relying on the\nuse of an open-source or Software as a Service (SaaS) ETL tool to remove some\nof the technical lift.\n\n### **Loading**\n\nDuring the loading stage, data that was extracted is loaded into the target\ndata warehouse. Some examples of modern data warehouses include Snowflake,\nAmazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery. Examples of other data storage platforms\ninclude data lakes such as Databricks\u2019s Data Lakes. Most of the SaaS\napplications that extract data from your data sources will also load it into\nyour target data warehouse. Custom or in-house extraction and load processes\nusually require strong data engineering and technical skills.\n\n## **Step 2: Data exploration**\n\nOnce raw data is in your data warehouse, it\u2019s time to get an understanding of\nwhat this data looks like. During this stage, you\u2019ll find yourself:\n\n  * Looking at available ERDs (entity relationship diagrams) and join keys to understand how data joins itself together\n  * Identifying which columns are potentially missing values or have misleading column names\n  * Writing ad hoc queries to perform some light analysis or summary statistics on the data\u2014how many rows are there? Are primary keys unique? _Is there a primary key?_\n  * Understanding how currency, timezone, and data types differ across data sources\n\nThere is no perfect recipe for how to explore your raw data; do what feels\nnecessary for your data sources. If you have high confidence in the accuracy\nand completeness of your raw data, this step may feel less laborious than if\nyou question the integrity of your data (which, if you\u2019re a data practitioner,\nis probably your natural inclination \ud83d\ude09).\n\n## Step 3: Data transformation\n\nIn the actual transformation step, the raw data that has been loaded into your\ndata warehouse, you\u2019re familiar with how that data is structured, and you have\na general plan on how to approach it\u2014it\u2019s finally ready for your modeling\nprocess to begin! When you first looked at this data during the data\nexploration stage, you may have noticed a few things about it\u2026\n\n  * Column names may or may not be clear\n  * Tables are not joined to other tables\n  * Timestamps may be in the incorrect timezone for your reporting\n  * JSON is abundant and may need unnesting\n  * Tables may be missing primary keys\n\n\u2026hence the need for transformation! During the actual transformation process,\ndata from your data sources is usually:\n\n  * Lightly transformed: Fields are cast correctly, timestamp fields\u2019 timezones are made uniform, tables and fields are renamed appropriately, and more. In dbt, this usually happens in staging models used to create clean, uniform slates for your data.\n  * Heavily transformed: Business logic is added, appropriate materializations are established, data is joined together, aggregates and metrics are created, etc. In dbt, this usually happens in intermediate and mart models, creating the tables that are ultimately exposed to end business users and business intelligence (BI) tools.\n\nCommon ways to transform your data include leveraging modern technologies such\nas dbt to write modular and version-controlled transformations using SQL and\nPython. Other solutions include writing custom SQL and Python scripts that are\nautomated by some type of scheduler or utilizing stored procedures.\n\n## Step 4: Data testing\n\nYour data is modeled now and _feels generally_ right, but how are you\nconfirming the quality of the data that is transformed? How are you ensuring\nthat the key metrics and data you\u2019re exposing to downstream users are\ntrustworthy and reliable?\n\nAt this stage, data testing that meets your organization\u2019s standards should be\nconducted. This may look like:\n\n  * Testing primary key for uniqueness and non-nullness \n  * Ensuring column values fall in an expected range\n  * Checking that model relations line-up\n  * And more.\n\nUsing a product like dbt, where you can define code-based tests to run against\nyour data transformations, you can create a system where transformations are\neasily and regularly tested against the standards you establish.\n\n## Step 5: Data documentation\n\nYour data is transformed into meaningful business entities, tested to your\nstandards, and is exposed to end users. How do you expect folks who were not\ndirectly involved in the transformation process to navigate through them? What\ndocumentation are you creating to clarify business logic in transformations\nand describe core metrics and columns?\n\nAt this stage, transformation is done, but in a way, the work is just getting\nstarted. To make your data transformations meaningful and impactful to end\nusers, it\u2019s important to create and maintain robust documentation.\n\nWe recommend you start by documenting the following during your transformation\nprocess:\n\n  * The primary purpose of a transformation or data model\u2014what is the main reason this transformation was created? What important reports is it powering in your BI tool?\n  * Key columns that have business logic implemented in them or ambiguous column names\n  * Aggregates and metrics\n\nDocumentation for data transformation processes should often be written in a\nway that is understandable to the people who were not involved in the original\nprocess, instead of focusing on the _how_ of a transformation for more\ntechnical users. Well-written transformation documentation welcomes business\nusers into the fold of analytics work, and is a foundational way to ensure\nyour end users feels comfortable and empowered to use the data your team works\nso hard to build.\n\n## Step 6: Schedule and automate\n\nYour data transformations are created, tested, and documented\u2014now it\u2019s time to\nget them out into the world. At this stage, data engineers, data analysts, or\nanalytics engineers will push these transformations to production\u2014the process\nof running them in a production environment in the data warehouse. These\nproduction-ready tables are what analysts will query against for analysis and\nwhat a BI tool will read off of.\n\nThese data transformations will need to be refreshed, or updated, on a cadence\nthat meets your business needs using some type of scheduler or orchestrator.\nUsing a product like dbt Cloud, you can create your data transformations and\ntests within a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) and then\nrun them on a regular cadence using the dbt Cloud job scheduler. Other\nsolutions that often require more technical lift include relying on custom\ncron schedulers or external orchestrators.\n\n## Rise and repeat!\n\nAfter you build your foundational data transformations, your focus will likely\nshift to optimizing, governing, and democratizing the work; for each new data\nsource, business problem, or entity needed, there will always be more data\ntransformation work to get done. As a result, a good data transformation\nprocess is one that is simultaneously rigid and flexible\u2014the process allows\nfor enough guardrails to make analytics work worthwhile and organized, with\nenough room to be interesting, challenging, and customized to your business.\n\nLast modified on: Mar 27, 2023\n\n  * Accelerate speed to insight \n  * Democratize data responsibly \n  * Build trust in data across business \n\nCreate a free account Book a demo __\n\nAchieve a 194% ROI with dbt Cloud.
