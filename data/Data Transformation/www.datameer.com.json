The data transformation\nprocess for many years focused on the \u201cT\u201d in ETL ( extract, transform, and\nload ).  Inside an ETL pipeline, data transformation primarily focused on\ncleansing data and mapping it from a source schema to a destination one.  As\norganizations became more sophisticated in their destination schemas (star-\nand snowflake-schemas), these mapping processes became more complex.\n\nIn the 2010s through today, the role of data transformation has expanded.  New\ndata sources and formats emerged, and new platforms such as data lakes were\ndeployed to support this.  The role of data transformation became increasingly\nimportant to help deliver value.  New, complex data formats needed to be\nnormalized, cleansed, integrated with traditional sources (often existing data\nwarehouses), and then enriched.\n\nAnd finally, data preparation became an integral component for self-service\ndata transformation by analysts in the second half of the 2010s.  This allowed\nindividual, less technical analysts to perform a wide variety of\ntransformations on the data without relying on and waiting for IT and data\nteams to create data transformation pipelines for them.\n\n## Key Recent Trends\n\nIn recent years, new trends have emerged that have changed the way people\nthink about and perform data transformation, including:\n\n  * Cloud data warehouses \u2013 Many organizations deploying new or migrating existing data warehouses in the cloud to take advantage of the economics, flexibility, and modern architecture.  Cloud data warehouses also provide a unique platform to perform SQL-based data transformation.\n  * ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform) \u2013 The processing model for data pipelines has changed from the previous ETL one to ELT.  In the ELT model, the data transformation step is last (after loading source data) and is performed inside the cloud data warehouse either directly via SQL scripting or higher-level tools.\n  * Multi-persona analytics engineering \u2013 While data engineering was an inside-out task for data teams to deliver data to the business, a new analytics engineering process has emerged.  Analytics engineering involves collaboration between the data and analytics teams, uses the ELT approach, and shares the workload between these different personas to make the process more efficient.\n  * Cloud/SaaS \u2013 With much of your data residing in a cloud data warehouse, organizations want similar SaaS-based services for data transformation that give them the same economics, flexibility, and fit in their modern architecture.\n\n## Data Transformation SaaS Solution\n\nWith a Data Transformation SaaS solution, a customer can subscribe to and gain\nnearly immediate access to the managed service, use the data transformation\ntools to create models, manage and deploy data transformation models, and\noperate these pipelines to ensure an effective data transformation flow.\n\nAs a managed service, the customer does not need to bring or operate any cloud\ncompute or storage services of their own.  When the SaaS platform focuses on\nfacilitating the transformation in an ELT process, the customer simply points\nthe system to their existing cloud data warehouse, which provides the data\nstorage and compute horsepower.\n\n## What Does a Data Transformation SaaS Solution Bring to the Table?\n\nOne obvious and core benefit a Data Transformation SaaS solution offers is\nsimilar to that of cloud and SaaS services: scalability, flexibility, and\nmodernization.  Beyond this, it brings together additional benefits that\ninclude:\n\n  * A neat fit into a modern data stack\n  * Direct integration with your cloud data warehouse\n  * More modern tools with interesting new capabilities\n  * Data documentation and discovery services\n  * Collaboration across the entire team\n\nLet\u2019s explore each of these in more detail.\n\n## Modern Data Stack\n\nAs organizations move their analytics into the cloud, they often create a new,\nmodern data stack around tools and processes that embrace cloud technologies\nand embody scalability and flexibility.  The new modern data stack often\nincludes:\n\n  1. Data loaders that facilitate the EL of the ELT process,\n  2. A cloud data warehouse,\n  3. A data transformation tool,\n  4. Analytics and/or data science tools\n  5. DataOps/data observability tools\n\nOf the modern data stack components, items 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all SaaS/managed\nservices that are easy to subscribe to, use, and operate.  Hence, Data\nTransformation as a Service is a much more natural fit within this stack\ncarries with it similar compute and operational benefits as the other cloud-\nbased SaaS services, and integrates more effectively with core components such\nas your cloud data warehouse (see below)\n\n## Cloud Data Warehouse Integration\n\nAs organizations create their modern data stack, the cloud data warehouse\nbecomes the centerpiece and main workhorse.  It provides the core storage and\ncompute (query) facilities for the architecture.  It also provides a standard\ninterface and component to which the remaining tools in the stack can\nintegrate.\n\nA data transformation as a service platform embraces the cloud data warehouse\nas its\u2019 lynchpin, integrating with the core services the CDW provides.\nThrough its integration with the CDW, the Data Transformation SaaS platform\nwill:\n\n  * Create and maintain its data models within the CDW,\n  * Embrace the CDW\u2019s SQL language for transformation execution (either thru direct SQL or SQL generated via higher-level modeling \u2013 see below), and\n  * Use the CDW query engine for processing and storage engine for materialized data models.\n\nThis creates a highly efficient execution model for data transformations and\nuses highly cost-effective CDW query/compute and storage services.\n\n## Modern Tools\n\nThere are a large number of tools that perform data transformation on the\nmarket.  Some are legacy tools, and some are more modern.  Even though legacy\ntools have had multiple facelifts over the years, these products still embrace\nold-style data transformation, as seen here with Informatica and Talend .\nEven some cloud/SaaS-based tools that support the ELT process still have old-\nstyle data transformation interfaces, as seen here with Matillion .\n\nA good data transformation as a service tool embraces the modern fact that\nthere are multiple personas involves in the analytics engineering process,\nincluding data engineers, analytics engineers (more technical analysts), data\nanalysts, and data scientists.  Each of these personas often has:\n\n  * Different skill sets ranging from being highly technical to less technical,\n  * Different knowledge and understanding of how data is used,\n  * Different focal points on their role and where they can best use their time.\n\nTo this end, a SaaS Data Transformation tool will provide a much more modern\ntool that allows each persona to get involves in the data transformation\nprocess, best use their skills and ensure they spend the most time doing what\nthey do best.  For example, data analysts can spend more time on analysis and\nless on data transformation through an easy-to-use no-code or low-code data\ntransformation interface.\n\nA highly modern SaaS Data Transformation platform should support three\ndifferent interfaces to support multiple personas:\n\n  * No-code \u2013 for non-technical data and business analysts\n  * Low-code \u2013 for slightly more data-savvy data analysts or for analytics engineers that want greater productivity than coding\n  * Code \u2013 for data and analytics engineers that want to use SQL for the control and optimization that comes with it.\n\n## Documentation and Discovery\n\nData documentation is often spread among wiki pages, metadata management\nsystems, or early versions of data catalogs.  Most of these sources still do\nnot capture much of the knowledge there is about the data.  Some data\ntransformation tools attempt to generate documentation about data, but often\nthis is just taking comments from SQL code and generating a wiki page or\nadding a limited description.\n\nA Data Transformation SaaS tool will embrace the ability to capture as much\ninformation as possible about the data it is working with, the transformations\nperformed, and the resulting data models.  This would include auto-generated\ndocumentation and information such as schema information, transformations\nperformed, data lineage, and audits.\n\nA Data Transformation SaaS tool should also facilitate user-generated\ninformation about data, capturing additional information from across the data\nand analytics community, including:\n\n  * Descriptions, which can both explain data and how best to use it,\n  * Tags, which can help organize and identify data,\n  * Comments, which can add simple ideas around data or enable collaboration,\n  * Business metadata, which translates technical metadata into business terms\n  * Status and certification fields, which describe the state of a data object\n\n## Collaboration\n\nIn traditional data engineering processes, often where things break down is\nwhen the data team needs to interpret the needs of the analytics teams and\nmismatches arrive in the produced datasets, wasting valuable time and effort.\nThis happens because the data teams know a lot about the data but little about\nhow it is used by the business, and visa-versa for the analytics teams, they\nknow little about the data but know how the business will use it.\n\nBesides supporting the multiple personas that are involved with a modern data\nstack, a data transformation platform facilitate a collaborative data\nlifecycle process that eliminates errors and mismatches in the analytics\nengineering process:\n\n  * Analytics teams can use the no-code or low-code tools to interactively create and explore base models they are looking for from the data, and also add descriptions of the resulting analytics to show how the business will use it,\n  * Data teams can then use the SQL or low-code tools to fully flesh out the final data pipeline and models to the \u201cspecs\u201d provided by the analysts, then operationalize these\n\nThis collaborative process eliminates errors in data transformation and\nmodeling, speeding the overall process by 20-30x.\n\n## The Most Important Benefits\n\nWhile a data transformation SaaS platform can provide all the aforementioned\neveryday benefits to the data and analytics teams, the most important benefits\nit brings is to the bottom line:\n\n  * Up to a 40% reduction in data and analytics engineering costs due to greater productivity,\n  * Up to 300% greater ROI from data and analytics engineering due to greater productivity,\n  * Up to 500% greater ROI from your cloud data warehouse from greater productivity and faster availability of data to the business\n\n## Datameer\n\nDatameer is a powerful SaaS data transformation platform that runs in\nSnowflake \u2013 your modern, scalable cloud data warehouse \u2013 that combines to\nprovide a highly scalable and flexible environment to transform your data into\nmeaningful analytics.
