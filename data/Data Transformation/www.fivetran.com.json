In order to analyze data, data must\nfirst be organized and structured in a manner that can be easily interpreted\nby analysts and formed into dashboards, reports, and predictive models. Data\nis a business asset, but only if you can make use of it. Like ore in an\nunderground lode, it\u2019s worth much more after it\u2019s mined, refined, and\nfashioned into something useful.  \n\nIn a business setting, the ore is data that lives in business applications \u2014\nSalesforce, Google Analytics, and more. To realize its value, you have to\nextract the data and load it into a repository from which you can derive\nbusiness intelligence.  \n\nThat\u2019s what ELT software does: It **extracts** data from hundreds of different\nsource systems, **loads** it into a data warehouse or data lake, and\n**transforms** it into shape for use in analysis.\n\n### Contents\n\nChapter 1: What is data transformation?\n\nChapter 2: Data transformation techniques\n\nChapter 3: Where Fivetran fits in\n\n\u200d\n\n### What is data transformation?  \n\nData transformation is the process of revising, computing, separating and\ncombining raw data into analysis-ready data models. Data models are\nrepresentations of reality that can be readily turned into metrics, reports\nand dashboards to help users accomplish specific goals. In particular,\nbusinesses need KPIs and other metrics in order to quantify and understand\nwhat and how they are doing.  \n\nTransformation prepares data for a range of use cases, including:  \n\n  *  **Analytics** \u2013 Analytics for supporting decisions starts with metrics. Sometimes, metrics can be computed from a single source and only need a modest amount of transformation. Other times, the only way to compute a metric is to combine data from a wide range of sources and then aggregate it.  \n\n  *  **Machine learning \u2013** Machine learning is automated pattern recognition. ** ** Business applications of machine learning include revenue and profit projections, predictive modeling to support major decisions, systems to recommend products for customers and all kinds of business process automation. **  \n**\n\n  *  **Regulatory compliance** \u2013 Needlessly storing personal identifiable information (PII) leaves sensitive data vulnerable to a range of accidental and malicious data breaches. Data breaches compromise the privacy of your data and create serious problems both for you and your customers.  \n\n### Data transformation techniques\n\nRaw data is seldom structured or formatted in a way that serves the use cases\nlisted above. Some common examples of transformations that make data more\nreadily useful include the following.\n\n#### **Revising**\n\nRevising data ensures that values are correct and organized in a manner that\nsupports their intended use. **Database normalization** is one form of\nrevising data by reducing a data model to a \u201cnormal\u201d form without redundancies\nor one-to-many values in a column. Normalization reduces storage needs and\nmakes a data model more concise and more legible to analysts. However, it is\nvery labor-intensive, requiring a great deal of investigation, reverse\nengineering and critical thinking.\n\n  \n\n **Data cleansing** converts data values for formatting compatibility.\n\n **Format revision/conversion** replaces incompatible characters, converting\nunits, converting date formatting and otherwise changing data types.\n\n **Key restructuring** creates generic identifiers out of values with built-in\nmeanings, so they can be used as fixed, unique keys across tables.\n\n **Deduplication** means identifying and removing duplicate records.\n\n **Data validation** evaluates the validity of a record by the completeness of\nthe data, usually by excluding incomplete records.\n\n **Removing unused and repeated columns** allows you to select the fields you\nwant to use as features, i.e. the input variables to a predictive model. It\ncan also improve the performance and overall legibility of a model.\n\n####  **Computing**\n\nA common use case for computing new data values from existing data is to\ncalculate rates, proportions, summary statistics and other important figures.\nAnother is to turn unstructured data, such as from media files, into\nstructured data that can be interpreted by a machine learning algorithm.  \n\n **Derivation** includes simple cross-column calculations.\n\n **Summarization** consists of using aggregate functions to produce summary\nvalues.\n\n **Pivoting** turns row values into columns and vice-versa.\n\n **Sorting, ordering and indexing** organize records in some ordinal manner to\nimprove search performance\n\n **Scaling, standardization and normalization** put numbers on a consistent\nscale, such as fractions of a standard deviation in Z-score normalization.\nThis allows dissimilar numbers to be compared with each other.\n\n **Vectorization** converts non-numerical data into arrays of numbers. There\nare many machine learning applications of these transformations, such as for\nnatural language processing (NLP) and image recognition.\n\nOne example of vectorization is converting song lyrics into a \u201cbag of words,\u201d\nor a series of records consisting of word counts.\n\n\u200d  \nAnother example is converting an image into a matrix of RGB values that\nrepresent the color value of the pixels in the image.\n\n#### Separating\n\nSeparating consists of dividing values into their constituent parts. Data\nvalues are often combined within the same field because of idiosyncrasies in\ndata collection, but may need to be separated to perform more granular\nanalysis.  \n\n **Splitting** a single column into multiple columns is often used for fields\ncontaining delimited values, or for converting a column with multiple possible\ncategorical values into dummy variables for regression analysis.\n\n **Filtering** excludes data on the basis of certain row values or columns.\n\n#### Combining\n\nA common and important task in analytics is to combine records from across\ndifferent tables and data from multiple sources in order to build a full\npicture of an organization\u2019s activities.  \n\n **Joining** is the act of linking data across tables.\n\n **Merging, which is also known as appending or union,** combines records from\nmultiple tables. By blending the two tables using a common column, such as\n\u201cemail\u201d in the example below, you can assemble parts of the sales and\nmarketing funnel. This is also an example of integration, which consists of\nreconciling names and values for the same data element across different\ntables.\n\nThe examples listed above illustrate how additional processing is nearly\nalways required to turn raw data into usable data models. Transformations\nthemselves are a key part of a broader process called **data integration**\n**,** without which analytics and data science are impossible.  \n\n### Where Fivetran fits in\n\nFivetran automatically addresses many of the common issues that data\nprofessionals face with transformations. In addition to moving data by\nscheduling extracts from your data sources, Fivetran automatically creates and\nmanages schemas and data types appropriately for your destination. This\ncreates tables that are immediately ready to query in your data warehouse or\ndata lake.\n\nIn addition, Fivetran offers data transformation tools such as column blocking\nand hashing to exclude or anonymize sensitive data and an extensive library of\ndata models that can be readily applied to our supported data sources.  \n\n **Download \"** **The Ultimate Guide to Data Transformation** **\" for an in-\ndepth look on this topic.**\n\n## Start for free\n\nJoin the thousands of companies using Fivetran to centralize and transform\ntheir data.\n\nThank you!
