Though some people have dismissed them as a fad or even an outright con,
cryptocurrencies have flourished even as their future is in flux. Beyond
Bitcoin, there's now a long list of low-cost currencies that can potentially
bring significant speculative returns for investors who can handle their
volatility. Other currencies have matured and now suffer fewer spikes and
dips, making them better bets for the more risk-averse investor.

Whatever coins you choose, you'll first need to sign up with an exchange.
However, once you've bought in, you'll need to store your new currency and
perhaps spend some of it on goods, services, or debts. For that, you'll need a
cryptocurrency wallet.

* * *

## What Is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?

Cryptocurrency wallets come in several forms, spanning software, hardware, or
even paper. What they have in common is that they're all intended to store at
least one kind of digital asset. In addition, they manage the cryptographic
keys and other security considerations associated with key storage, digital
currency transactions, and identity (ID) verification.

The cryptographic keys associated with your wallet are long strings of
machine-generated numbers and letters. They're called keys because they're
used to lock and unlock your cryptocurrency collection and generate your
wallet's addresses. That means they hold a lot of power, so when choosing your
wallet, you must carefully consider where these keys are generated and who
controls them.

* * *

## Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets come in a variety of forms. However, one concept you'll
often hear discussed is the difference between hot and cold wallets.

 **Cold wallets** use keys created by a machine that is _not_ connected to the
internet. This adds an extra layer of "air-gap" security, and lets these
wallets come in a hardware format. Typically, a USB hard disk or thumb drive
encrypts your stored currencies and automatically accesses your chosen
exchange when you connect it to the web. Connect, perform your transaction,
and then disconnect again, so your assets stay safely off-web until you're
ready to use them again.

**Hot wallets** are the products we discuss in this guide. As you might
expect, this kind of cryptocurrency wallet uses keys generated by internet-
connected devices. These are typically servers at the wallet manufacturer's
location or the wallet's back-end exchange. Even though the internet
connectivity makes hot wallets notably less secure than cold wallets, they're
still the most popular. That's because many can make trades without a separate
connection to an exchange, and they can store other kinds of digital assets
besides cryptocurrency. Most of the cryptocurrency wallets listed here support
more than one kind of digital asset, though some support far more than others.

We'll talk more about how to choose the right wallet for you later in this
guide. For now, here's a survey of some of the top hot wallets available.

## Atomic Wallet

Visit SIte at Atomic Wallet

See It

Atomic Wallet offers a good balance of beginner and advanced features. It
supports more than 500 different crypto assets, has an easy-to-use interface,
and lets you buy currencies directly from the wallet, rather than going to an
exchange and then sending your coins to yourself. The wallet's most touted
features include its support for atomic swap transactions and staking (see
"Crypto Trading Terms" and "Going Decentralized," below).

You can download an Atomic Wallet for almost any operating system, including
Android, iOS and macOS, Windows, and several flavors of Linux, including
Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu.

Unfortunately, security is Atomic Wallet's Achilles heel. Your keys are
encrypted and stored on your personal device. They're protected using a
randomly generated, 12-word passphrase. But aside from telling users they
should do their transactions with a VPN, that's where security stops. So far,
there's no support for two-factor authentication or multi-signature
transactions (see "Keeping Your Wallet Safe," below). However, Atomic Wallet
promises new security features in the near future.

## Bitpay Wallet

Learn More at GitHub

See It

This is a popular wallet from Bitpay, the crypto payment provider. Like
Coinbase, Bitpay is only available as a mobile app, though it's even more
restrictive in that it only supports iOS. It's also restricted to just 13
cryptocurrencies, though that includes all the stable names, such as Bitcoin,
Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Still, if you're looking for
a wallet that casts a wide crypto net, you're much better off with Atomic
Wallet or Coinbase.

On the security side, Bitpay offers all the key features, including two-factor
authentication and multi-signature transactions. It's is a "self-custodial"
wallet, meaning only you have control over your assets and encryption keys.

On the services side, Bitpay lags behind Coinbase and other leading wallets
when it comes to regular feature updates and add-on crypto apps. At this
point, Bitpay Wallet is a little lacking in advanced features, including
analytics and decentralized finance (DeFi) support (see "Crypto Trading
Terms," below). However, it offers a crypto credit card directly linked to
your wallet, and integrates with a number of large retailers' in-store credit
programs.

## BRD

Learn More at BRD

See It

BRD is a popular, multi-currency wallet that's solely available for Android or
iOS devices. BRD supports more than 70 cryptocurrencies, including all the
stable coins.

BRD's security features are a little weak in that it supports two-factor
authentication, but not multi-signature transactions. It's also lacks direct
support for hardware cold wallets. One the positive side, it forces you to set
a supplementary pin and TouchID on both supported operating systems. On
Android, the keys are encrypted and stored on the phone; on iOS, they're
backed up to iCloud.

You can buy, sell, and trade directly through the wallet, and BRD imports
third-party wallets and balances via QR code. Be careful, though; while BRD
charges no transaction fee for outgoing trades, it does charge for fiat
transactions, where you're buying crypto directly from the wallet by using
your credit card, for example. These fees can go as high as 7%, according to
third-party BRD discussion groups. That's massive compared to Coinbase. Still,
this might not be an issue if you strictly buy via third-party exchanges and
like easy, mobile functionality.

## Coinbase Wallet

Learn More at Coinbase

See It

Coinbase stands out from the pack because it's mature and easy enough for
novices. It's available on Android and iOS devices, and it has a clean, easy-
to-navigate interface. Coinbase is optimized for use with Coinbase Exchange
accounts, but it can connect to other exchanges, including decentralized
exchanges.

Coinbase Wallet currently supports more than 5,500 different crypto assets,
including digital collectibles and NFTs. That's one of the longest list of any
hot wallet out there. It's also fairly secure without being overly
complicated. It supports biometric authentication, two-factor authentication,
and multi-signature support, too. Finally, you'll find optional support for
cloud backups so you can better safeguard your digital keys.

That's a competitive list of security measures, but the downside of using a
wallet service as large as Coinbase is that it's a target. The Coinbase
Exchange and the wallet service have been hacked on separate occasions, and
there are near-constant phishing campaigns aimed at its users. To help,
Coinbase has become a "self-custody" wallet, meaning it puts you in charge of
your crypto keys so they can't be stolen off the back end. That puts the onus
on you to encrypt and store your keys somewhere safe.

## Crypto.com

Visit Site at Crypto.com

See It

This one isn't for beginners. However, if you're a fairly experienced crypto
geek, Crypto.com has an advanced set of features and solid security. It offers
two wallet apps, the more cutting-edge of which is fully decentralized.
Transactions are strictly peer-to-peer. There's no oversight from a third
party, such as a bank, exchange, or government agency. That's great if you're
a privacy-conscious person, but it also attracts less-than-reputable players.

Crypto.com's other app is more standard in that it's your window into the
Crypto.com exchange. This is the better route if you're new to crypto
investing, because it's a brokerage service that has easier and more familiar
tools to buy and store your crypto assets. This app can also be used as a
wallet, but it's entirely tied to the Crypto.com exchange. It acts as your key
custodian and therefore stores your tokens in a brokerage account rather than
on a personal device. This is certainly easier, but this also comes with some
risk considering the long history of exchanges like this being hacked and
robbed.

All in all, beginners should probably pass this one by in favor of an easier-
to-use platform like BRD or Coinbase. Once you're comfortable there, you can
always come back to Crypto.com.

## Exodus

$0.00 at Exodus

See It

Though it was originally built exclusively for desktop users, Exodus has
evolved into a multi-device wallet that also supports Android and iOS devices.
It also works with Trezor cold wallets. Like Coinbase, it's mature, intuitive,
and easy to use, though Coinbase has a better support program. Exodus'
interface is more visually attractive than Coinbase's. It also supports more
than 155 crypto asset types, which is respectable, though still small when
compared to wallets like Atomic, Coinbase, or Huobi.

Exodus is updated regularly, typically on a two-week cycle, which means new
features are commonplace. In addition, Exodus bills itself as a "light"
client, meaning it doesn't download a crypto asset's entire blockchain. That
can speed up your transactions, though this probably isn't of huge interest
unless you're an active crypto investor.

One major ding, however, is that Exodus is still woefully behind its
competition in terms of security. There's still no support for two-factor
authentication or multi-signature addresses (see "Keeping Your Wallet Safe,"
below), which are common security measures supported by many other wallets.

## Electrum Bitcoin Wallet

Visit Site at Electrum Bitcoin Wallet

See It

If you're only interested in Bitcoin, Electrum is one of your best options.
This mature wallet has many features, especially around security, and it's
highly customizable. Plus, it's open source, so it's got a good variety of
third-party plug-ins available, and also works with a (fairly) long list of
hardware wallets for cold storage. You can download Electrum as Python code,
as well as fully compiled apps for Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows 7. It
lacks iOS support.

Electrum offers many security features, including the aforementioned cold
wallets, multi-signature support, and two-factor authentication (see "Keeping
Your Wallet Safe," below). The wallet is an open-source project, so there's a
certain amount of DIY expertise required. This is a great wallet for Bitcoin
investors, but there's definitely a learning curve. Climbing it only happens
through Electrum's online, developer-focused documentation.

Go to the trouble to learn it, however, and you'll find that Electrum offers
several competitive features. Notably, it supports adjustable transaction
fees: Pay a little more, and your deal goes through faster. If you don't need
millisecond trading, you can pay less for a slightly longer wait time.
Electrum is speedy because it's a lightweight client that uses simple payment
verification (SPV). That means it only downloads part of the blockchain to
speed up performance.

## Huobi Wallet

Visit Site at Huobi Wallet

See It

Huobi is a sophisticated, decentralized wallet (see "Crypto Trading Terms,"
below) that supports trading more than 1,000 different digital assets across
multiple blockchains. However, one caveat is that the company started out in
China, but once that country banned all cryptocurrencies, it moved to
Seychelles, an archipelago off of East Africa. If you prefer to work with a
US-based company, check out Coinbase.

The Huobi Wallet is available for Android and iOS, and it's a self-custodial
wallet (so you're in charge of your own keys). However, Huobi is also
introducing another wallet, called Cloud Wallet, that's meant for beginners,
and ties directly into the Huobi exchange. It, too, is a Defi wallet, but
it'll make using that technology easier since the cloud service will handle
security and access details.

The Huobi exchange provides a huge list of financial services, including
support for derivatives, spot trading, a crypto credit service, and many more
features aimed strictly at sophisticated traders. Experienced crypto hounds
should love this wallet. If beginners can get over the initial learning
hurdles, the exchange has all the features they need to grow their portfolios
without switching to meatier services.

## Jaxx Liberty

The Jaxx Liberty Wallet has a fairly intuitive user interface, and it runs on
most any operating system, including Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. There
are even distro-specific clients for several Linux flavors, including Debian
and the popular desktop distro, Ubuntu.

One catch is that Jaxx Liberty doesn't support fiat transactions (meaning the
ability to buy coins directly through the app using your credit card), so you
need third-party crypto exchanges to make purchases. For most people, however,
this simply means becoming familiar with the ShapeShift exchange, which Jaxx
directly supports. ShapeShift is decentralized, and supports more than 750
different cryptocurrencies across 11 separate blockchains.

The bad news is that Jaxx trails most of the competition in terms of security.
Like Exodus, Jaxx is a self-custodial wallet, which means you're in control of
your keys. Where Jaxx falls seriously short is that it doesn't offer support
for multi-signature transactions or, even more surprising, two-factor
authentication (see "Keeping Your Wallet Safe," below). That last one is a bit
of a doozy.

## Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet

Visit Site at Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet

See It

Like Electrum, Mycelium is a Bitcoin-focused wallet, but it's arguably even
more mature than its competitor. This is evidenced by its long list of
sophisticated features, including support for a wide variety of accounts that
are compatible with several cold storage hardware wallets. Also like Electrum,
it's an open-source project, although its apps are only available for Android
and iOS.

If you're primarily interested in Bitcoin, Mycelium is an excellent choice, as
long as you're at least somewhat familiar with how cryptocurrencies operate.
Although its interface isn't as easy as BRD or Coinbase, Mycelium's intuitive
enough for intermediate Bitcoin investors. You'll quickly find and move
between your various accounts, and there's a handy transaction history that
goes along with each one. Again like Electrum, Mycelium has a custom
transaction fee structure, which means you can adjust your fees up or down
depending on how long you want to wait for your transactions to process.

Mycelium has solid security, too. It's a self-custodial wallet, which means
you're in total control of your keys. It supports both two-factor
authentication, multi-signature transactions, and biometrics (see "Keeping
Your Wallet Safe," below). It also offers single-address accounts, so you can
delete your keys from your device, effectively turning your phone into a cold
wallet. Once you're ready to trade again, you just import your keys and you're
good to go. This feature is not for rank beginners or people who conduct
numerous transactions every day. Still, it's a great way to bypass those daily
hacking worries.

## What You Want in a Crypto Wallet

The first feature you should be looking at when choosing a cryptocurrency
wallet is whether it supports the currencies you want to use. If you want to
dabble in multiple currencies or other kinds of digital assets, like NFTs, you
should make sure that your wallet supports as many as possible. It should also
be able to easily connect with at least one exchange that allows multicurrency
operations. Both Exodus and Jaxx fit this particular bill.

If you're looking to speculate, you're likely comfortable with a certain
amount of risk. You're probably also interested in protecting your transaction
privacy. This means you should be looking for a wallet that doesn't require
any specific exchange on the back end, or if it does, then it's an exchange
that doesn't require much in the way of ID verification or identifying
transaction data. ShapeShift is a very popular exchange for these kinds of
users.

But maybe speculating isn't your thing. Perhaps you'd like to experiment with
cryptocurrency, but want to do it in a safer, more regulated environment⁠—and
you're willing to give up a certain amount of transaction privacy to do it.
You should be looking for a regulated exchange like Coinbase, which also makes
the Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase is a US company that works hard to meet US
banking regulations, and has the deep pockets to do it. It limits the
currencies and assets you can use, but many people feel safer using this kind
of platform for that very reason.

Next, there are more minimalist cryptocurrency wallets, such as BRD and Bitpay
Wallet. These are primarily mobile wallets intended to let you track and
access your digital funds on the go. Originally, they weren't meant to work as
trading platforms or to store large crypto sums. These mobile wallets have
decent security, and you can use several of them simultaneously. That can be
useful to separate different kinds of assets, exchange connections, or
investment strategies.

* * *

## Crypto Trading Terms

In the past few years, how investors make money with cryptocurrencies has
changed, and wallets evolved to keep up. Most investors follow roughly the
same strategy as standard stock players: buy low, sell high. However, a key
trend these days is generating passive revenue with your crypto assets, which
your wallet must specifically support. Below are several strategies you should
understand before choosing a wallet.

  *  **Staking**. This boils down to earning rewards by holding and not trading certain cryptocurrencies for a set time. Staking can earn you between 5% and 20% of your holding's value, but most currencies that support staking have a minimum investment to be eligible, so you may have to front some money to earn more down the line. Then again, staking means your coins are earning you potentially significant returns instead of sitting in your wallet while waiting for a price spike. 

  *  **Interest**. Like mainstream banks, many exchanges let you deposit crypto into an account that earns an interest-bearing yield. You might not be able to access your deposited funds for a short time, but the interest rates can be significant, so this is another easy way to generate passive income with your coins. 

  *  **Token Stocks**. This refers to a cryptocurrency backed by equity shares in whatever organization created the coin. Some offer dividends just like mainstream stocks do, usually paid out quarterly. 

Your potential tax burden is another important wallet consideration,
especially if you're in the US. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,
signed into law in November 2021, upped the reporting requirements for
exchanges and investors alike. Those requirements span coins and other kinds
of digital assets, especially NFTs. This will be a point of legal contention
in 2022, but as far as your wallet and exchange choices go, you'll want to
make sure both support the new reporting requirements.

* * *

## Going Decentralized

Another important trend is decentralized finance, called DeFi for short. This
refers to a wide variety of financial services available on certain
cryptocurrency blockchains. Ethereum is the big name here, but other
blockchains are moving in this direction, too. The services you can get on a
DeFi chain are the same ones available with non-DeFi chains. The difference is
that DeFi is generally faster and has zero oversight by a third party.
Transactions are peer-to-peer, so they're between just you and the person with
whom you're transacting. That makes a DeFi chain fairly anonymous and very
open.

Another factor associated with DeFi chains and wallets is that they use
decentralized apps (called DApps), and your wallet will need to support these
directly. DApps provide easier access to services like tracking and lending,
in addition to heightened security and privacy capabilities.

A feature related to DeFi is the **atomic swap** , which lets you trade
cryptocurrencies across different blockchains in a peer-to-peer format. It
uses smart contracts, so you can look at atomic swaps as a form of if-then
statements. If specific conditions are met, namely the details of the
transaction, then the transaction goes through. If they aren't, nothing
happens. The conditions are on a timer, and once that clock runs out, the
transaction terminates. That provides a safety mechanism so atomic swap users
don't steal currency from each other. A wallet must support atomic swaps if
you want to explore this kind of trading.

* * *

## The Security Question

You may be wondering if cryptocurrency wallets are safe. Unfortunately, that's
not an easy question. All of the cryptocurrency wallets we list here are
generally safe and employ a basic layer of security. But, yes, some are a
little safer than others.

A traditional hot wallet is _hosted_ , meaning the cryptocurrency wallet
manufacturer or the exchange controls and stores your keys. This is both good
and bad On the one hand, they probably have better security than you do. On
the other hand, they're also likely storing thousands of users' keys, so
hackers will target them much more than they would a single user. It also
potentially impacts your privacy, since the exchange will have to at least
partially track what you're doing.

Decentralized hot wallets, on the other hand, have no centralized back-end
system that you need to work through when you want to sell, trade, or buy
connect to any exchange and let you control your wallet's keys. They also let
you connect and generate a peer-to-peer transaction directly with anyone,
anywhere, with no institutional oversight. That sounds good from a privacy
angle, but it also attracts some shady characters. And, given our government's
current move toward strengthening policy around cryptocurrencies,
decentralized exchanges face an uncertain future, so it pays to be cautious
here.

Several wallet services have been hacked in the past, so most hot wallets
these days are "self-custodial," which means they no longer store your keys on
back-end servers. You're responsible for storing and protecting the keys
yourself. The thing to look for here is whether or not the wallet offers a
recovery process should you lose your keys. Some do, some don't. If they do,
it's generally done via a randomly-generated 12-word security phrase. Lose
that phrase, however, and you're out of luck.

* * *

## Keeping Your Wallet Safe

Cryptocurrency wallets all have password-controlled access to them. They
encrypt all transaction data via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) while in transit,
and they securely store your public and private keys, either encrypted on your
local device or on the cryptocurrency wallet maker's servers.

That's the minimum security your wallet needs to have, but there are three
other key features you should also look for: multi-factor authentication
(MFA), biometrics, and multi-signature support.

  *  **MFA.** This feature generates a token or key from the cryptocurrency wallet maker that you'd need to know to access your wallet. This additional code might be sent to you via a text message, an email, an authenticator app, or even a hardware security key. This means malcontents trying to hack your account would need to not only know your primary account credentials, but also have access to the device that receives the secondary code. That's significantly more difficult and dangerous for the bad guys, so it's an excellent additional layer of security.

  *  **Biometrics**. These days, most mobile devices support ways to recognize characteristics of your physical body, including fingerprint readers and facial recognition. Tacking that verification on top of a password and a secondary code is another quick and easy way to keep your cryptocurrency wallet safer. 

  *  **Multi-Signature Support.**  This feature works like a joint bank account, but at the key level. Typically, such a system is referred to as a "two out of three" system. That's because it generates three keys with three separate addresses: one controlled by the account holder (you), and one controlled by the service, and one that's shared. You need at least two out of the three keys to access the account. There are even more elaborate variations on this feature, including the 3-of-5 scheme that Coinbase uses for its Vault service.

* * *

## Some Final Thoughts

Overall, the cryptocurrency wallets we present here are some of the best hot
wallet solutions available. Some are better for beginners, while others are
aimed at seasoned veterans. However, even among this relatively small group,
you'll need to decide which of two basic camps you fall into before you can
choose the right wallet. The first camp is the speculators who are comfortable
with risk and aren't looking for a cryptocurrency wallet that asks a lot of
questions. The second camp consists of conservative investors who are
interested in fewer digital assets and desire a safe environment that's more
akin to our regulated banking industry.

If you're in Camp 1, you're best off with a wallet like Exodus. It's easy to
use, supports a large number of digital assets, and can access less regulated,
DeFi exchanges, like ShapeShift. If you're in Camp 2, then something like the
Coinbase Wallet is your best bet. It's backed by a reputable US firm that's
not only well-funded, but also well-secured and in compliance with all
relevant US banking laws.

Measure your wallet choices against these two yardsticks, and you'll have the
best chance of landing on what's best for your needs.
