# Our latest update to the quality rater guidelines: E-A-T gets an extra E for
Experience

bookmark_border Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content

Thursday, December 15, 2022

Many creators are familiar with the concept of E-A-T, which is used in how we
evaluate if our search ranking systems are providing helpful, relevant
information. Would ordinary people feel the results they get demonstrate
E-A-T, that is: expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness?

Now to better assess our results, E-A-T is gaining an E: experience. Does
content also demonstrate that it was produced with some degree of experience,
such as with actual use of a product, having actually visited a place or
communicating what a person experienced? There are some situations where
really what you value most is content produced by someone who has first-hand,
life experience on the topic at hand.

For example, if you're looking for information on how to correctly fill out
your tax returns, that's probably a situation where you want to see content
produced by an expert in the field of accounting. But if you're looking for
reviews of a tax preparation software, you might be looking for a different
kind of information—maybe it's a forum discussion from people who have
experience with different services.

E-E-A-T — or "Double-E-A-T," if you prefer, is now part of the updated search
rater guidelines we've just released. You'll also see clearer guidance
throughout the guidelines underscoring the importance of content created to be
original and helpful for people, and explaining that helpful information can
come in a variety of different formats and from a range of sources.

These are not fundamentally new ideas. And we're by no means abandoning the
fundamental principle that Search seeks to surface reliable information,
especially on topics where information quality is critically important.
Rather, we hope these updates better capture the nuances of how people look
for information and the diversity of quality information that exists in the
world.

As a reminder, these guidelines are what are used by our search raters to help
evaluate the performance of our various search ranking systems, and they don't
directly influence ranking. They can also be useful to creators seeking to
understand how to self-assess their own content to be successful in Google
Search. Our page on how to create helpful, people-first content has a section
that explains this more.
