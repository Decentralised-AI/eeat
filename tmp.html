"With SEON, I can see that the address has been around since 2012 because it
appeared in data breaches. I can see it’s been registered on these 15 other
social websites. From then I can just manually match the relevant information
to make my case. Working with more accurate data allows me and my team to move
faster – and with minimum user friction. Whereas the team had to wait hours or
days to verify someone’s payment, SEON allows them to do it in 30 mins or
less."

Rick Hiltbrunner

Senior Manager of Fraud Operations

"As soon as our staff used SEON on a regular basis, they could see its value.
It immediately started saving them time as they didn’t have to trawl through
the usual checkpoints. So much so, that the time spent by Air France analysts
on manual reviews is down by an impressive 70%. Instead, all the information
they needed was on one screen with a simple scoring system enabling them to
see if a transaction was real or not."

Eric Facquet

Deputy Manager of Fraud Prevention

"The most useful thing for us was to be able to see if the email and phone
numbers weren’t registered anywhere. We also rely on the device fingerprinting
metadata in our scorecard to filter out junk users. We immediately saved about
6% of costs on our automated KYC checks. After only 2 months, we started
seeing impressive results. Up to 3 times fewer cases of defaulting customers
in new regions such as Romania and Europe. 4 months later, the fraud rates
dropped by over 65%."

Sergey Bogdanov

Chief Risk Officer

"We were looking at another provider, but they came back to us with a 4-6
months integration window. With SEON, it was literally a phone call, sandbox
tests on Monday and by the end of the week, it was done. One other thing I’d
like to comment on is the pricing model. It’s really 2022, like for scaling
together. The SEON model, it’s now one we actively look for with our other
partners. Clearly an organization that approaches work and its customers in a
different way."

Coert Snyman

Senior Analyst

"I tested some extra rules, and over a few months I managed to push SEON’s
auto approval from an initial accuracy of 95% unto 99.5%. Taking the time to
update your SEON rules is an investment that gives great results. And the best
thing is that we can do so without deploying any software. From an engineering
perspective, it is extremely time and resource saving, allowing us to react
much faster."

Phillipp Keller

Senior Product Manager

"I couldn’t believe how fast the results came,” says Gergely. “Our chargeback
rates dropped by 91% in one month only.” Moreover, the number of manual
queries and fraud catch rates continued to improve after the initial 30 days
as the system adjusted itself – part of the benefits of deploying a machine-
learning algorithm to fine-tune accuracy."

Gergely Kálmán

CEO

"SEON allows us to stay one step ahead as by keeping advantage players at bay
we are able to continue offering competitive bonuses with low wagering
requirements to our players,” Daniel says. “And the fact that SEON team are so
open to feedback and implement the feedback quickly gives us as their client a
significant advantage which we couldn’t find with other competitors in their
field."

Daniel Saliba

Head of Compliance

"It wasn’t just the technology that’s great though, the education side of
things helped us understand the types of tactics and patterns used by
fraudsters and put rules into place to prevent them."

Stacey Pickering

Head of Operations

"We deployed SEON both on our website and web app to gather device data as
well as IP and email information. It was unbelievably fast, both in terms of
integration and results. In 4 days only, our fraud rates were pretty much down
to 0."

Lewis Bye

Senior Projects and Operations Specialist

"We overlay SEON’s digital and social lookup with device fingerprinting to get
a good indication of whether the phone or tablet belongs to the actual client.
We can instantly filter out obvious fraudsters with no digital or social
presence, and we get better intelligence to automate our decision making."

Juris Rieksts-Riekstinš

Head of Risk

"One core piece of data we get from SEON is the ability to profile customers
based on a phone number. Because what we do is through WhatsApp, being able to
check social signals really helps us get a better sense of how real the user
is. It’s a tool in our toolkit that is pretty unique."
