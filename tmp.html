Hello and welcome to another episode of the Search Engine Optimization Tips
and Tricks podcast. My name is Tim Jennings and I have been helping
Soulheart’s clients with their SEO efforts for over eight years now.

Today I want to talk about an acronym that you probably have heard thrown
around, explain what it is, why it matters, and what’s the latest with it.
That acronym is EAT. You may have heard it as Google EAT.

EAT stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust. It’s a part of
Google’s algorithm and it’s used in Google’s Search Quality Evaluator
Guidelines. To put it plain and simple, you need to understand EAT if you want
to have a chance at ranking your content. Google uses it to determine the
quality of your content and whether or not it’s worthy to be ranking for a
search query.

Let’s break down the classics of EAT before we go into the latest happenings.

As I mentioned earlier, E stands for Expertise. Google’s algorithm is
instructed to note and decide the level of expertise the creator of the
content has. To be an expert you must be “very knowledgeable about or skillful
in a particular area.” However, having this knowledge alone isn’t going to
open the floodgates to your website.

You need to know how to communicate your knowledge in a way that is engaging
with a user. So in other words, you need to not only possess the information
but also have an understanding of what your audience wants and how to best
give them that information. To do this you will want to start with keyword
research to find the queries that your audience is searching for and then also
try to understand the intent behind the terms you find. Once you know those
two things you’re able to create content that your audience will find
valuable.

When you’re creating your content for those keywords that you discovered while
doing your research, you should be figuring out where in the purchasing cycle
the user is. If they’re looking for just information on a subject matter, then
your content trying to land a sale probably isn’t going to rank very well and
if it does, it’s not likely to convert many users. Likewise, if your only
producing informative content for a keyword that searchers are using to make a
purchase, you’re content will suffer.

But here’s one other thing that you need to keep in mind when creating new
content: don’t just regurgitate what’s already in the search results. If
you’re an expert on the subject, your content should have some unique insights
that all the other content that’s already been produced doesn’t cover.

Next in the EAT acronym is Authoritativeness. Being an expert is fantastic but
there’s more to the equation. When other experts start linking and citing your
content, you become an authority.

Obtaining links from other authoritative sites are incredibly important for
ranking your content. In fact, many will argue it is the most important
factor. So securing these links are necessary. But Authoritativeness goes well
beyond securing links so I’ll briefly cover some other areas that you can
improve your Authoritativeness score:

Having other websites also simply mention you in their content can also
demonstrates your Authoritativeness. Content that is widely shared on social
media, having a Wikipedia page, building a brand that gets searched for, and
having a high trust score with Magestic’s trust flow tools all help with
gauging and building your Authoritativeness too.

And the final factor in the classic EAT acronym is Trust. While Expertise and
Authoritativeness boost your rankings, having a lack of perception of
trustworthiness can plummet your rankings. If you have a high level of
negative sentiment around you or your brand then you can pretty much guarantee
that your content will suffer in the search results pages.

You should not only be making your customers happy but also address any
negative issues that may arise. Google has mentioned several times that having
too many negative reviews can demonstrate a low level of quality.

Here are some ways that you can improve your trustworthiness score:

  * Create a contact page that gives a user a clear path to easily contact the website’s owner 
  * Having a terms and conditions page and a privacy policy page that are easily accessible. Many websites place these in the footer of the site so it’s on every page 
  * Adding a physical address if you have a brick-and-mortar office 
  * Ensuring your website is secure and using https instead of http 
  * Create bios for your authors that include any degrees, certifications, or other demonstrations of skill/knowledge
  * If you are selling a product or accepting any transactions then you should have a refund and returns policy as well as include any specifications about the product or service

That is a general overview of the classic EAT acronym that Google uses to
determine if your content is worthy of ranking and ranking well. However,
Google has recently expanded on its EAT acronym to include another E at the
beginning. Still pronounced EAT, it is now E-E-A-T.

But what does the second E stand for in EEAT? Experience! It is not enough to
demonstrate your Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. You should
now include your experience in your content.

Here is what Google’s search quality rater guidelines have to say about
Experience: “Consider the extent to which the content creator has the
necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are
trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a
wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product
review from someone who has personally used the product or a “review” by
someone who has not?”

Now that we know what Google says, there are some great ways that you can
demonstrate your experience:

  * You can create in-depth bio pages for your authors showing what credentials they have, the amount of experience they have, and providing examples of their experience in those bios 
  * Create case studies and link to those case studies in your content that demonstrate your experience on the subject matter 
  * You can create how-to guides and videos showing you using the product or service first-hand
  * You can mention any relevant results you’ve seen or talk about what happened when you did or didn’t take a certain action
  * And anything else that would set you apart or demonstrate your level of experience on the subject matter

So there you have it, a brief but hopefully clear explanation of what Google’s
EEAT acronym is and why it is important. I do think it is important to mention
a couple other things before ending today’s episode. The first is that EEAT is
NOT a ranking factor but it is used by Google’s algorithms to determine the
quality of the content and what content should be ranking where when it is
looking at their ranking factors. So if your site and another site have
similar ranking factors, EEAT can be used to give you the boost needed to
outrank your competition. Also, when considering EEAT, there seems to be a
renewed emphasis on TRUSTWORTHINESS because as Google mentions “Experience,
Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T) are all important
considerations in PQ (Page Quality) rating. The most important member at the
center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust.” That tells us that we should be
investing a lot of time and effort into ensuring that our websites are deemed
trustworthy in the eyes of Google’s search engine.
