It is most often used by financial institutions, such as banks. KYC software helps prevent fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. On top of that, it\u2019s often required to maintain local or global compliance."

            {
                "question": "How does the KYC solution work?",
                "answer": "KYC solutions employ various automated and manual verification checks used to validate user identity. These checks include ID verification, source of funds checks, customer due diligence, and watchlist screening. On top of that, advanced KYC vendors like Sumsub also offer extra products such as workflow customization, reporting, dashboards, collaboration tools, and many other optimization measures useful for a compliance team."

            {
                "question": "How do I choose a KYC provider?",
                "answer": "There are a lot of factors to assess before choosing a KYC/AML solution for your business. A well-rounded KYC service is compliant worldwide, as well as accurate and fast in fraud detection and AML screening. It also should have good UI, integrate well with third-party services, and meet high standards of customer support, SLA delivery, and data privacy."

            {
                "question": "Which KYC service is best?",
                "answer": "The \u201cbest\u201d solution to pick depends greatly on the requirements of your business. A proper KYC service offers a range of automated verification and authentication checks, integration options, and high pass rates globally. When choosing, evaluate the onboarding experience, verification accuracy, and compliance standards."
            },
            {
                "question": "How much does KYC cost?",
                "answer": "Popular KYC providers generally offer either a flat fee per verification or a monthly subscription with a certain volume of verifications included in the package. Associated costs such as integration and training should also be accounted for when selecting KYC software. The price can start from as little as under a dollar per check."
